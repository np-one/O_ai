it works okay I think that the results are accurate but not particularly controllable so some of the newer search tools we've been looking at obviously have a better looking result page and and or you know have a automatic response as soon as you start typing in a phrase this is nice but it's also good because it's only 250 dollars a year and considering that we hardly enough don't really have much in the way of searching going on on our site I mean it's according to our analytics we're only getting about three and a half percent up let users using search at least within our own site you know we you know the people are coming in driving in from Google's itself or from other sites that's a drive traffic to our sites .,
