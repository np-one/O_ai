so it's a very different experience when I navigate versus when I search for the same category page the next example is OK there we go the next example is crew neck pullovers and you can see here we're probably seeing maybe three examples of pull over maybe not all of them are crew neck but when we actually go to the navigation part of it and you can act see a lot of results there are crew neck pullovers right and not just three there's actually 15 if I can see your graphics so because I'm searching I'm actually seeing see your product right and that is also problem so what do you guys do today if you like this comes up let's say the CEO did the same search or a customer sent us an email saying I can't seem to buying what I'm looking for how do you guys go about solving this is there a team that it specifically goes to or is there a manual process to what do you guys do for that,
