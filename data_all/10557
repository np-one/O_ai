but yeah that's kind of where originally why we kind of walk walked away was aggressive but we were like this isn't something we're even going to like try to spend too many resources on because we knew it was going to be a big resource allocation we knew you know trying to implement this in terms of what we were able of doing for fourth quarter was going to be very hard for us and then the costs associated with it were so far beyond what we were currently paying that it it's hard to justify and even they don't not to get you inside baseball but even the cost associated with increased sales sounds really great but you know our profit margin margin could support it in theory you know the great thing about sales is in theory you think it makes you richer but it doesn't always the cost associated for sale that's the margin increase unit is what we're going to need in terms of infrastructure to support additional process being put out you know we make boards for a living so if we're selling board that's great if we're selling lower margin items it's not so you know there was a lot of things that would have had to get put into that calculation that as a company we just haven't been here so we're we were very focused on going okay fourth quarter is going to be here but the idea of saying oh we're going to have a cost model associated services not fixed prices going to be based on you know an annual increase in sales differential was definitely something that wasn't received well because of the idea of oh we're going to pile up this in fourth quarter which is our busiest quarter so there was just a lot of things associated with it that that caught us enough in a way that that that made us want to like kind of hit the pause button till January.,
