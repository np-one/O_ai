You can edit any filter you can also add a filter you can give it a name you can map it to a specific field also and this is where you build synonyms as I told you there's no requirement to actually go go and build a synonym. Because everything works automatically on the system but if there is a very specific industry jargon like this is an example of a customer that we have in the weightlifting space. Where shoes are actually called as lifters so what they have done is they have come to the system they say we said add a synonym. And they've said shoes and bi-directional parameters lifters and they've created the synonym it's as simple to create a synonym but otherwise you don't have to create it all right.,
