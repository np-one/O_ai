But with the enough categories that they have they've not been able to do that and they have a very limited set of categories like curved lines so it unfortunately which is what forced us to even come up with the solution. But again it's not important for a lot of them a lot of the week sellers I just wanted to make sure that this is something that really helps you guys okay the next one is variances. And I also wanted to check if this is a challenge or not so let's say today I search for red dress or I might search for red chair etc and you might have that same product in multiple colours I don't know if you guys have a lot of variances or not I don't think I saw a lot of them. I mean you have a lot of products with a lot of colours but I don't know if it's the same product in five different colours I think they're everywhere everything is much unique so I'm not sure if this is applicable or not. But the idea behind this was if I search for a red dress all of these products have a red dress but I'm not seeing the red dress so Unbxd solved that problem also by automatically picking out the red image of that dress and to show that instead of any primary image that might have been assigned to that particular product. Same thing we've done we've built a library of colour synonyms on the back end we we've created so let's say for example I search for crimson something just because I want to make sure everything matches.,
