So the first step will be we agree upon a tentative price we look at overall all the terms and then most importantly we'd have to set up a integration kickoff call Where probably somebody from your side you and if there's anyone from IT I think the other day the other gentleman coming from IT so we can do a overall requirement talk as to how the autocomplete design should look like any specific rule based sets that you want to look we have a normal checklist that we go through usually it's a 60-minute call we gather all the And information And then what we do is after the call is done we will send you a bunch of autocomplete designs you can just review them and see which one works for you after that my team basically does all the coding at the backend we should roughly put two two and a half week effort after that we put everything on a test environment Then you can have your team just test it out once and then once you're fully satisfied with the test results then we can depending on a convenient date we can actually take it live and then start monitoring it on live traffic It should be a fairly straightforward call anticipate call at least the review which we have done on your site I don't see I was getting into any kind of complications,
