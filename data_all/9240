Same thing look for data card ID printer ribbons again left hand side it actually shows ID card printer on the right hand side it understand a with navigation I am able to go and find results. Product type query I looked at my fare hid smart cards here you see the first one is actually hid but not from my fare it's from I class it's not even the same brand but it shows up on top. Price slot one of the functionality that is at times not not typically I would say look that or consider very seriously and and I'll show you this and this is common with various different sites. Looked at photo ID I mean camera I get the relevant results in the first fold but I get hundred and seventy-three items you probably do not carry so many cameras now as a as a customer I might be interested to look at the the cheapest photo ID camera available on the site and hence I would go and sort it by price low to high the moment I do that I start seeing a lot of products related to cameras sometimes maybe not related to cameras right but not the actual cameras right and this shows that the relevancy is pretty hard coded today what what way it has been set today on the site is that first fold has the relevant results but post the first first fold these products are not relevant . I And hence it will work for certain popular queries but as as soon as someone comes and does a unique query on the site the relevancy will completely break.,
