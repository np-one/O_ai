So another reason why we believe when we talk about product discovery we address the entire gamut the first component that we built was site search and even today relevancy has always been our strongest in it and I'll take you through a few examples on what we mean when we talk about relevancy and we also today I have a comprehensive product recommendation product we also have a product that we help you power your category pages we've recently launched our personalization product which can actually do both one is to one personalization as well as segment and target and we have a merchandising dashboard a tool which is slightly similar to an Endeca experience manager but it's more of a 20-17 solution so it's it's much more easier to use it's has a much more sleeker UI and a lot of segmentation capabilities that you would probably not find with Endeca So essentially that's the whole gamut that we address right.,
