The VacParts screen this is the old site this is the new site so because they used to have two different search boxes for two kinds of visitors on their site one who who used to search by part number others who used to search by model name right they didn't know the part number they will come for a model name and then start in further parts which came in they said you cannot have two different search Boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box and also at the back end you have to now start optimizing two search boxes all together. So instead what we did is build something like this the moment I type bissel on the left hand side you see all the parts for the bissel on the right hand side you will see all the models for the bissel and then some of the top searches for the same here is another customer thirty five million dollars in revenue based of Texas they sell military a parallel to US citizens for them brand in their categories and some of the popular products was important so this is what we will for them Nike the moment I start typing NI shows me the nike the most popular brand then some of the categories within Nike some of the other brands <>so the top queries starting with Ni and then some of the popular products from Nike. Say over a period of time this fourth black boot became more popular than this would come a position one and others would come down here what we designed for Express say the moment I start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories and when I browse through these shows me the popular products on the left-hand side within each of these categories . And last one I know this is not from a vertical but just wanted to show the breadth of our solution.,
