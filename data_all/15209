Dynamic filters so this is a big differentiator that we bring onto the table I notice I think you do not have filters on your website today but so say if you have filters and you have say specific filters in this case for shoes obviously the shoe filters are going to be something like ankle height width or they are specific to shoes.  Now irrespective of however I search on the website say casual shoes formal shoes shoes as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category and here them being shoes the shoes filters would automatically kick in now if I was searching for shirts say however I should search for shirts men shirts casual shirts formal shirts the shirts filters would automatically kick in.,
