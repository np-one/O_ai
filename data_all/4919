yeah so I do a lot of the operations here but I also do get a majority of the analytics so I look at you know customer is coming in to our site what's happening at you know while they're in there and then when they're leaving I pull all of the sales data analytics as well so after after we have we do I do monthly reporting or actually weekly reporting and all of our sales numbers what feeling somebody asking me for something I handle also the in-store pickup program so anything that is in store pickup where are we're using our retailers inventory I look at all of those and make sure everything there is working properly the same thing we also have a ship to store program so if you want if the store doesn't have it in stock we will ship it to the store for you for free and I go through all of those to make sure that everything is working there and again I also pull all the analytics for each one of those areas.,
