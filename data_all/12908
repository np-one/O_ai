right okay now obviously since you have a mobile insight all of that will be taken care of inherently when we do this implementation for desktop as well so that part will be taken care off and as I said I will share these autosuggest designs with you so that we can just you know go through them and let me know which are the ones that you like for the recommendations I just want to understand which ones would you like to start off with initially so if you want I can just give you a quick list of the ones that we generally recommend to start off with and once we've captured analytics data for around 10 to 12 days that's when you can start putting in some of the other recommendation widgets as well.,
