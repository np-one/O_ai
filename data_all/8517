That you can expect for a lot of new sites having a very poor site search the other metrics that they judge is the adoption of site search right we have seen that before Unbxd there were 10% users and especially in b2b right. Because their customers and repeat customers who know that I'll not be able to find a product with search and let me not even try doing that and let me just I know exactly what category I want to see and they they would they would go to those two and four pages and then go to the right category navigate and then pick up the right product right. But once they realize that the search is improved the search adoption also increases right so there could be various different metrics starting from the search adoption to overall ideally the search conversion because you need to make at least 10x of whatever you are spending with us. And that will do only happen by increasing the conversions right so we set those kind of metrics within the first 90 days of the POC and and the idea is to make sure that we achieve those metrics and post 90 days. If you like the solution if you like what you what we have delivered then you can continue and get into an yearly contract if you don't like what what we have delivered then you can walk out of the bond of the contract.,
