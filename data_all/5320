fantastic so starting with a product discovery stage what we gave them is task one is a highly specific task was over-the-knee brown boots do you buy these the customer response is then recorded as 18 out of 25 customers use site search remaining seven used navigation so this is pretty much smack in the middle of industry standard that we have seen so far we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the US and where all of the customers that we've done this study this is a pretty standard percentage it's usually between 65 to 75 where the intent the idea here is when of the intent is very very clear if it's highly specific a lot of customers will use site search versus some very few customers will even that use navigation however what is important to understand is there's always customers who will use navigation users appreciated the keyword suggestions and visual autocomplete on the search which help them get an idea of the products available the keyword suggestions were helpful since there are so many products listed on the site but there were a couple of feedbacks in terms of where they were saying starting to say over-the-knee and the suggestion was only one it was only taking them to that category.,
