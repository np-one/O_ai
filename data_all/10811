got it so let me answer the second question first from a integration perspective so if we were to go down the front end approach which was the Ajax approach that we have proposed we could create a very standardized that every sub-site could use.  and if that's okay with you guys there might be a limitation in terms of the colour and stuff it might look a little bit more for standard so it might not have some specific colours if each of the sub sites might have we can do it Ajax approached from that standpoint.,
