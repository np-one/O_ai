no no I'm and that's our job to make sure when we do an implementation call it's it's more about understanding your business requirement because that's ties in back into a philosophy Michael. because we as of today know that we've built a kick-ass product but being in the bay area where we also know that somebody else would come and kick our ass in six months or a year from now so it's just not technology that will make all the difference beyond technology it's about people right I have to come on board I have to tell you that this is how we can come and help you increase revenue right. and you will have to tell me okay this is what I think we can do to increase our revenue and we have to work together so it's that business relationship and making sure that the great product we have fits into your specific requirements. because your needs are very different from mine or anybody else and if you didn't have a business differentiator people wouldn't have come onto your site they would have probably gone to Amazon and bought everything they wanted but there is a reason why people come out to your site and we want to understand that reason.,
