Here is another example I tried on the site look for purabead and I tried this in various different ways as a natural language query this is the product this comes in a dimension of 24 by 12 inches if I'm not wrong that that's what the product description here says now I look for 24 by 12 purabead <at level 10> here could not get anything I look for 24 star 12 again the results page then I look for 24 inch purabead a zero results page right. So it is again important to understand any such you know natural language variations in your search queries that the customers that the customers are doing and show them the right set of results. Here it is an example right blue dress on sale again natural language query products on sale I would say are are something like best dress available right something of those lines on those lines and the system is able to understand and then show the right set of results head query search right when the intent of the customer is not clear for your site.,
