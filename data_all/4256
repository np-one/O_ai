great so uh Jennie thanks again for taking the time to join us for this call so I know I originally reached out to Bill kiss and you know that's how the call got set up so so the idea was to kind of give you a high-level introduction to Unbxd gotta talk to you about some of the things that we helped retailers such as yourself with we also prepared a customer experience study for Ace Hardware just kind of showing you some examples from your site and some of the areas where we see an opportunity and and also kind of you know share some industry insiders and best practices so just to give you a background on me so I'm fairly new with Unbxd I joined about you know little over a month ago but I've been in the e-commerce space the last few years I was with Akamai prior and the other voice you heard in the call was Monal so Monal is our SVP & chief business officer so I wanted to make sure he's able to join as well just because he works very closely with some of our large customers and has a very good perspective on some of the challenges that retailers like you face today and also to be able to give some good insights into how we were able to address them.,
