ok so that gives me an idea of what what these options look like ok next is a grocery customer again very different vertical but here in grocery if you look at your past grocery run you'll notice that you probably bought lots of products in a single transaction right same is true for online grocery so almost 15 products on an average are bought in a single transaction the problem however these customer ran into is that it would take too many clicks to buy these 15 products it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these products so to solve that problem we designed the autocomplete to look like this where the idea in the theory is that customers buy pretty much the same products that they always buy every week every other week most of the products are the same and they have some exceptions to what they might be looking to buy so here if I buy a chicken boneless breast I'll see that up top if you buy a chicken without skin you'll see that a top right and so the idea was to personalise the experience for each customer because the frequency is so often for products that you normally don't buy you also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories so.,
