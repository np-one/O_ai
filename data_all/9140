Right so it is a monthly fee we are a SAS that's SAS  models it's a subscription model and it is a monthly fee so there's two types of fees one there's a small set up fee and then there's a monthly fee the set up fees calculated typically as 2x or 3X of the monthly fee depending on what kind of customization we need to do on our end to help you set it up but more importantly Gary we come up with a POC model because I can show you fanciest presentations I can talk really fancy stuff and show you amazing slide it means nothing unless you actually try it. So what we usually talk about is do a quick POC it typically takes four to six weeks to get up and running with our solutions with the front end approach and we try for 60 days or 90 days however much a long time you want to try. To see that this is actually working for you and not only you should see an uptick in conversion you should see an uptick in average order values also but what we do is we guarantee that you will see an uptick in conversion.,
