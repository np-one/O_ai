and again its very easy to point out mistakes on someones site what i also wanted to take you through is take you through some examples of implementations that we've done some in your vertical some in a different vertical and ill take you through 3 or 4 different verticals so that you'll get the like the depth of implementations that we actually have right and the kind of customisations that we could actually have so I'll starts with a part manufacturer Parts Warehouse ___ those are 25 30 million dollars online for them if you've seen their site three years ago you actually would've found 2 different search boxes because they had 2 kinds of customers one customer who exactly knew which parts to buy the other kind of customer who did not know the part  ___ who probably come and search for a model name so they though having 2 different search boxes will solve the problem but it ended up amplifying the problem because now you had to optimize for two different search experience and the relevancy got completely SKUd.,
