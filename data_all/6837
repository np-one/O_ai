so if I actually set things now I go in and say if I look at dresses and I might look at maxi dresses now we're going an evening out I might actually show you pink images of those versus if they're available instead of these are the primary images that are available right and so we've changed and it's not dramatic like that it's subtle subtle hints in-between and stuff like that maybe if I look at a certain size and for that size if let's say these two products are not available in that size anymore but these two products do have that size these two products will start to show up up top instead of the other two because you want to make sure that the right size products are that are in inventory are actually available to the customer to choose to see those so.,
