another thing I was also quickly take you through how we can actually do it on Magento with Magento it's very simple because we actually have a plug-in available there are essentially three modes of implementation we do right one is called as a hosted approach right where essentially we are hosting and rendering the search results like if you have Bob Barkercom and if you have a sub domain for search called search.BobBob Barker.com search dot BobBarker.com is completely powered by Unbxd right it's a traditional way of doing things that impact your SEO we personally don't recommend it but for smaller sites are good sites where you don't want to manage or you don't want to have the headache of running search you can completely offload that to us right .,
