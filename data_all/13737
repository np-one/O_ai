okay so maybe you give us a read-only access to Google Analytics will come up and we'll sign it into you for that we'll come up with what we can say is going to be at least a guaranteed performance improvement okay this is a guarantee and what I mean by that is let's say when if you give us a chance for 90 days we will guarantee an improvement of say 5% 10% we won't come in and say well double it or triple it we're not gonna be stupid like that very conservative what we actually can deliver and what would that number look like from an ROI perspective if you do 5% incremental you're making $37000 in incremental revenue for you which may not be material for you guys based on what your numbers are but just as an example that will be the case then we'll also tell you what we believe will happen in six months nine months and a year okay and what would that number look like and our pricing is going to be one price point let's say it's $2000 per month I'm just again making this number up it's true it does not change no matter what our performance is if we do 20% or if we do 10% our price will still be one fixed cost and fixed cost is based on two new factors your catalogue size and the number of sessions that you have per month on an average you're 12 months rolling average of sessions if let's say you give us a chance for 90 days and we do not deliver what we had promised you walk away you don't pay us anything.,
