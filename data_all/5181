well I I know that our speed will the speed for us we respond within less than 100 milliseconds for any query that we get through our database now I can tell you that this people increased but what happens when you get the data how does PHP manipulate that parse it if all of that still takes a lot of time then the speed will not increase so I can't really confidently tell you because I don't know how your back-end system is designed if it was Magento I would at least have some idea because I would know how the back in this magenta system works then I know that yes it will definitely it should increase the speed if here's the two reasons why I will increase the speed mind you one is if the PHP manipulation is very fast it's the database where the data is coming from is slow the speed will increase because now the database is getting bypassed you're getting data from us which we are really faster if the database was all so fast the PHP was also fast it's just some of your servers are pretty slow in terms of just responding to the browser then there is nothing anything that you can do nothing can really change it's it's one of those two things what is really the bottleneck and what we are replacing if you're not replacing the bottleneck your speed will not change I hope that makes sense Kamalesh .,
