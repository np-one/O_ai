Even within these say four pages here you see us on top but say the next ten visitors on the site actually clicked on can say the Canada return policy more often then obviously the Canada policy would go on top and US would come on come down the row. So the next is I looked at some sort of compatibility search right again and I'm very very I would say new to your industry so was not even sure if this is something that that that would be considered as a compatible search but I try to make an assumption and look at this when I look for powder booth filters on Google you come up on the first or the second page of the Google search results page that's that's the first thing. When I click on that link takes me to this particular page and this is what it shows me as powder booth filters but when I actually search for powder booth filters it gives me these set of results I was not sure how relevant these results were but just wanted to show something that you are spending for on Google you are showing on top on Google but within the site when I try and type that as or search for that the result sets are surely not relevant. Does that make sense.,
