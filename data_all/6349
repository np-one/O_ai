no I I totally get it so I'll show you a few things in terms of what we do for mobile so here I wanted to just start with the autocomplete piece so if I now were to let's say do the Jean thing you can see that we took away the images we've optimised it only with the text aspect of it let's say if you do dresses <> now and how that search explains you saw that this it again rendered by us Express only renders the header and the footer we render everything in the middle you can see how our filters are optimised based on that versus when you had filters here they were all horizontal and this is what the filter experience looks like right versus now if I go to the mobile you can see that it's all optimised for mobile in terms of how the UI would work.,
