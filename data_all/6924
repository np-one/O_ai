that so again this was on edit all of <> and the third thing that we did notice or since this is a SAS product right and if you notice like we're hosted on Amazon we have present in like three Amazon locations across the country and we also have redundancy with the endetailstire infrastructure replicated overseas so that if anything had to happen in the US it's it's available and it's fronted by a CDN so you guarantee sub 300 millisecond response time perspective look where users are across the country I did a quick search speed test from the infrastructure you know this that the search results load load slightly slower compared to what an Internet retailer would recommend where it's generally recommended to be under 300 milli seconds and we've done this test on Express on Black Friday Cyber Monday where traffic is about 15 X normal and this is a part of our SLA which you would see in the contract irrespective of wherever you are in the country the pages load within 300 milliseconds so that's another benefit you get with a cloud solution where it's essentially you have a cloud solution and it's fronted by a CDN so people are probably receiving this data nearest to their server right.,
