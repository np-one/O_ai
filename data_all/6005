yeah so why don't you go to the page it's a few down yep so page here what the difference is let's say today because you have so many different categories of products so you might have perfumes versus lotion versus skin care etc the idea behind that is different categories of products customers like to narrow them down using different facets or filters so on the category pages it's easy to do that because you have a very well defined product result set and but in search it becomes even trickier because I can search for that category of products in a hundred different ways so you cannot manually go in and start to assign that's specific facets or filters for every single permutation and combination of a query right.,
