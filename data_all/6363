and I got a get running soon but one of the one of the other I guess we can say competitor platforms start looking at just you know kind of like yourself we just had kind of an exploratory call one thing that kind of caught our eye was that in terms of inventory we had an issue this past holiday season which was quite unfortunate where you know a lot of the end there was an inventory mix-up a lot of the inventory that just stayed in our US distribution centre got sent out to the brick-and-mortar stores because we have about 40 or so brick more stores in the US so all of a sudden we had very little inventory to pull from here in you know on EECOM in the US so when I <> when customers were going to the site busted a lot of the products on whatever collection page they'd go to or whatever would show out of stock and it looked especially bad it was you know the first one the first watches that would show up on the page so they had some we saw some options from this other platform where they could you know we could set rules and things where it would automatically push the out of stock to the bottom or it would you know it's kind of a dynamic thing or even if from what I understand even if we could somehow set it were a full watch was out of stock that maybe it wasn't visible on the page things like that do you guys deal with any sort of inventory optimisation at all.,
