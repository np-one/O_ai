okay all right and I know that you're on Shopify and you sent some details of how to install the plug-in but I just resend those to you so basically all you need to do at your end is install our shopify I plug in and then give us the access to one of the tests themes at your end or you just give us the access to the theme section and then unboxd will go ahead and create a copy of your current life theme and go ahead and make all the changes there in the test theme for everyone to preview and you know once everyone is fine to those we'll go ahead and push those tonight so that's for that but how would you want us to do the search because now my guests see and this currently when you click on search do you want to keep the same design when someone starts typing in you want the autosuggest to start coming in as a drop down here itself or how do you .,
