so again that's that's what the result was so two users out of 18 abandoned the search which at this stage now these are focus group participants we hired to do them to do this work so they didn't abandon anything but what they do at this point is they come back and say what do I do I don't know what to do next if they use those types of words or sentences then we know that if they were by themselves at home or at work they would have abandoned search next is navigation of the 18 users who use navigation to look for over-the-knee boots including the ones where it's switched over from search were able to find their preferred products under women's shoes in sections very easily so navigation definitely made it very easy the one thing did come back was your filters so they were using color filters and I actually was standing next to one of the customers where I saw this experience was they clicked on one of the color filters and you get this black border around that color right.,
