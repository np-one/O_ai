Okay so I tried say black sofa versus charcoal sofa totally different set of results with us what we have also built in built is a color synonym corpus let's say typically works really well in apparel because that's where people are very particular about the colors right so say I go on to a site and look for a crimson dress just because that's the theme of the party or that's the I I need it I have crimson shoe and I need a crimson dress the system is automatically able to understand that crimson belongs to the red color family so if you have a crimson product we immediately start showing crimson product but if you do not have a crimson product we understand let's say red ruby garnet Marlow these are colors which are more closer to crimson and we start boosting those products on top instead of showing them other black or gray or brown color products here is a stemming example from Express you'll see t-shirt t-shirts t-shirts with - without - or even a slang for t-shirt which is tees it automatically corrects it starts showing same set of results right in all these cases you would have noticed 424 results but for the query however the customer tries to search and and this is what makes the experience great on the site and enhance increase in conversions then I looked at the site search speed right how fast the pages were loading and I notice that that the at times the page load speeds were slow almost 200% slower than the 300 millisecond industry-standard something that has been set by Google according to Google anything you know lesser than 300 milliseconds is something that is not observable by the human eye and that's where this whole standard comes up but when I test that on your site looks like the West Coast seems to be the slowest but even the others remain more than 300 milliseconds here is a snapshot we took from Express site one of our engineer did that actually for the sales team this this was done on Black Friday one of their most busiest day and you'll notice all there across regions right it remains below 300 milliseconds then we work on a very tight SLA this is part of the contract that that the the search speed or the page load speeds would remain less than 300 milliseconds anything beyond that you would start penalizing ourselves then I looked at relevancy and before I get into relevancy right it's important to understand the behavior of how people are searching on any site right and that's what we did before we started Unbxd The founders spent quite some time doing research on two things a large catalogs how they were configured b how people are searching online today be it on Google of be it on say Amazon right how people are searching in general and we classified the search queries into 12 different types and there is a there's a white paper fitted with payment on these twelve types of queries so to give an example say exact search could be the exact product name model number screen number I am looking for feature search could be red dresses the red is the feature of the product dress party dress where party becomes the theme of a product dress could be a slang or an abbreviation wherein on an electronic site I start looking for a 55 inch TV and instead of inch I put double quotes out there natural language query Christmas gifts for toddlers there is no product mentioned but because today Google and Amazon is able to understand this the the users or the customers believe that every site can understand these kind of queries and then and sometimes they just copy-paste this from Google and copy it from Google and paste it on on an e-commerce site expecting them to start showing relevant results and if you are not able to understand it and start showing the relevant they will just leave the site believing that you do not carry these products so we built a system that was again able to understand 85 to 90 percent of all these dwell types of queries and start showing relevant results here are a few examples of that I took from your site exact search and I look for brown sofa the third product you see here is not a sofa some sort of table then I look for queen-size beds again got zero results you have lots of beds I'm sure some of them are also queen-size beds but again zero results that that return then I look for some of product type search as look for live wood table I'm a big fan of live wood tables by the way or live wood furnitures so it was good to see that you have a huge collection for live wood tables I when I click when I do this on Google you come on top and when I click on it this is the page on the right hand side and that it takes me to right the live wood table I'm sorry it's the other way around so when I am on google it actually is taking me to a wrong page right but when I search for it it still takes me to the right page the live wood table page here are a few examples from Express say blue straight leg slim fit jeans if you are able to solve a query of up to 5 to 6 words right and start showing them the relevant results brown loveseat with cupholder such a complex query on on Ashley this is a screenshot from Ashley and we were able to solve that and start showing relevant results for them then I look for some feature search some of the products some of the office chairs that I was looking at did have contemporary in the description right and if I'm not wrong people at times do come and look for this kind of terms right contemporary furniture so I tried to do that for office chair zero results I look for bright table lamps right now bright is something which becomes a feature of a product you might not have that in description but then this it's it's still necessary to understand that the customer is primary looking for table lamps and if you have any terms that does classify a table lamp into a brighter one than the other then the system should also be able to understand that and start throwing those out posting those products on top.,
