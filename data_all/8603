All right absolutely and I'm glad you said that because you're absolutely correct And the over all achieving level Chris relevant will all be dead before relevancy side right we all agree on that set and on that one point and nobody can come in and state and say that oh we've solved relevancy so that's never gonna happen I mean Google sort of the leader in that space is not being able to completing that so and they still are sort of evolving what what we believe that a slightly different approach that we wanted to take and all and just see your thoughts on that as well is from an approach perspective see today what you said is exactly true either they have they're looking for more like a category so they had they don't know what they really want but they know the aisle they want to go in right if you were to cook in compare them like into a sort of a physical store that maybe sold the same products how would I navigate that store I'll first go to the aisle and and then I'll narrow down from that aisle to exactly what I'm looking for I want to I want this particular nail I'm going to go to their hardware aisle first at Home Depot and then go to the you know the drawers that have the different types of nails in them and then I'll pick one out based on my needs because I don't know what it will fit my needs and I don't know what's available and then you have this other group of customers who know exactly what they want because either they've bought it before or they know from some other source that this is the right product for them so they might come in and know something about that product you know the UPC or the item code or the enough description to say I want one and a half inch you know roof construction nail something like that right and they get into that very specific city in both instances let me show you how we I want to just show you something really quickly because I think this will really address what we might be talking about there we go so here's what we had done for one of our customers can you see my screen I hope that.,
