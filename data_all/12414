okay so if I'm looking for bags bean bags and handbags the context of the word bag changes with the presence of the word being in it so it's not that one word is more important than the other the idea is that the context of one word in relation to the other right so the context actually changes which is what the semantic aspect of it is and that's what we're trying to say so if if let's say for example I am looking for Malcolm Gladwell books or just Malcolm Gladwell it's not that we're saying Gladwell is more important than Malcolm that's not the idea the presence of both words together creates and yet another context and that's that's what we're trying to do here it's understanding the context with one word or the presence of other words in the context of each other hopefully that .,
