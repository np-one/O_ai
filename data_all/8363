right so if we're doing if I could if I could do 171 plus you know five percent you know 171 plus five percent to I mean that's you know you know if we if we bumped up you know to one point you know 1 point 2% I would be you know 166 and revenue would be 220 so and if we were at 2% you know we would be at 6 times 3 I'd be it I have you know five hundred thousand a month and you know in revenue. so you know I don't I'm looking for ways to grow that you know and once again search Spring has been great but obviously I'm missing out on a lot of revenue so you know and just from the people who are already on our site now not even getting new traffic just getting more sales out of the traffic that we that we have these are people that are buying something. they're either buying it from me buying it from a competitor they're definitely buying it because of all of those people I mean there's a lot of repeat people coming back looking at the same product over and over and over again so yeah we want to capture those as well.,
