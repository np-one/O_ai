so typically you could also make outbound calls from your helpdesk system itself so when you make a call you know you have a pop up coming where the agent could add notes during the course of the call itself and let's say at the end of the call when he cuts it the system in fact pulls out the pop up and ask if you would like to convert this call into a ticket right so they could be instances where you might later need to follow up with that same person maybe through an email or certain other things like that so in that case what you could do it you could capture the name or if of course even the email address of that person and save it in the form of a ticket so that that's going to come here on top of the queue again and you could you know you can even have the call recording embedded against that specific ticket and you know you go about maybe later on following up maybe through an email with the same person right.,
