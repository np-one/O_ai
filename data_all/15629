Would need to like about for example if I wanted fragrance you know if I wanted a facet that was flower it smells like you know like the flower scent and you add like rose or tulip or orchid or whatever flower you would create that facet in the global facet area and then it would show up here and you would just hide all the other ones and then keep that fragrance on okay.,
