Okay awesome so this is the site this is the new site parts warehouse but this is how it used to look like before they came to us they had two different search boxes because they had two different kind of visitors on their site one who used to search by part the other who used to search by model right. And then and vac parts actually sells home appliance parts so we came in we said you can not have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box and instead what we build is something like this. The moment I start typing in the cell on the left hand side it starts showing me parts for the cell on the right hand side it starts showing me all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for the cell here is another customer of us US Patriot Tactical. They they sell military apparel to us citizens and and and one of the things for them that's important is the brand and some of the categories within the brand right and here you notice the moment I start typing in Ni it starts showing me some of the popular brands starting with Ni which is Nite ize Night vision apparel.,
