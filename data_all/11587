So they wanted their autocomplete to expose user to brands which is not easily well known right and the second business use case they had was they had they sell expensive products so they wanted a more visual tour of all the popular products on their site. So here if I type in N I where I am probably intending to type Nike first I given nice category scope okay Nike and in Nike these probably are the three top clicked products. Or categories with the machine learning of have had in the last few days it will also tell me that there's something called as Nine Line apparel and night-vision goggles is available on the site. And it will also give me all the top queries for something start with Ni then it gives me a visual tour of all the popular products available on the site starting with Ni. Again if you look at examples 1 & 2 completely different business use cases this <> the look and feel is completely different and customized to solve that business use case. The third example I want give you is again in a very very different vertical online grocery these guys are the largest online grocer in Southeast Asia.,
