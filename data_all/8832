We can look at those and we can see how you want to make it searchable is it more on the description more than the titles of those of those pages right so that is something that . And our implementation is the quickest in the industry takes I would say six to eight weeks typically six Weeks is more than enough for a suitable site live but we keep a buffer of of two weeks at least if there is any delay in terms of say back and forth in terms of designing or say even QA right ah doing pesticide and gives it to your team for testing you find a bug we fix it for you. So based on that it could be up to eight weeks but you say within six weeks we can take a site live. All our infrastructure is on Amazon making sure we have high availability of the systems we penalize ourselves for any downtime even for a 15 minutes downtime on the site we are ready to be penalized up to 15% of the monthly fee so that's the kind of confidence that we have and all our customers get a premium support which is 24/7 you can you will have a dedicated Account Manager that you can speak with and then contact them through email to chat through say phone and last but not least it's a completely ROI based model I can put in some numbers to show you what is the kind of ROI or what is the kind of revenue that we can influence for Vestavia right before you even be implemented we also guarantee it to some extent depending on the scale depending on on what your site performance is if we take the statistics and then guarantee what you can see in 60 90 days of running the POC with us .,
