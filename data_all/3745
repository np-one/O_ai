alright perfect cool so yeah so like I was saying we saw hope you could go about replying so now more importantly in terms of you know internally collaborating amongst it could be between various agents of the system or it could also be between maybe some of the other enabling teams in the system so let us look at that so now when let's say someone's trying to find out the status of the order there could be instances where you know you might need to communicate with some of your other enabling teams that you have there in your organization right so it could be maybe you'd have to reach out to the finance team or maybe the HR team and so forth right and it does not needed it that all those of you know users in your organization would have been added as agents in the system right so in order to collaborate with other users in your organization who are not added as agents in the system so that is where you have this option to forward this complete emails ticket said to that person right so in for example you get forward this to your someone from the finance team where they are going to receive the complete history of the sternal patient coming in to their mailbox and once they respond back to that that's going to come and get added as something known as a private note in the system right so subscribe it note is nothing but a node that gets added which will be visible just to the agents in the system and not to the end customer request requested for that specific query right so in this way you'll be able to collaborate with your other enabling teams to who might not be added as agents in the system by forwarding this completely get read to them and once they respond like I said it's going to come here and get added as a private note right.,
