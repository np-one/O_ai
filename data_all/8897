Okay so we'll jump through our slides or I'll just leave you with this one last thought our sees a SAS offering it connects with multiple different back-end systems so irrespective of what you choose we can integrate with the API and there is no additional cost for you to migrate from one platform to another platform. Or even if you want to shut it shut us down and one year from now that's completely okay because this is a SAS base offering and you can turn off the tap anytime you want so all those options belong to you and you could enjoy the service if you upgrade and you can shut down the service after you upgrade if you need if you think you come to that conclusion <>.,
