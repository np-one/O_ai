Uh usually not usually not but I can again check on That and get back to you or we can discuss our during uh maybe a tech call I could have my technical team to answer that but usually not. Because the way we meant is that as I showed in the beginning that it's it's it really does not depend on your platform how we are going to render is these functionalities have have no link with the platform the only advantage of you being on Shopify is that with Shopify we have a plugin so all the information with regards to the product catalog feed we start pulling out directly from Shopify you don't have to send your product catalog feeds field Sep basically you don't have to send us separately to us right whatever you are updating on Shopify is automatically updated to Unbxd. But apart from that be it on any any platform all of these functionalities. Variances you have variances say if you have different images for these variants products these could be variances of color variances of size or any other vince's. We have the technology to find the right variant image and start showing it say in this example red dress all of these dresses are available in the red but primarily the site is showing us the blue and the black back of the images of these dresses putting the onus on the customer to click on the red swatch and then look at the red dress image right giving giving the customer the first feel that these your dresses might not be available in red .,
