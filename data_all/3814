exactly what I was getting at to it so typically what you can do is since you know that originated already do have a support portal what he can do is have that link over here where once your customers click on let's say something like contact support that would redirect them to a boat route that would look something similar to this where they can you can have your FAQs your solution articles and you could increase the number of touch points for your customers to reach out to you to using this customer support portal and that's typically how you could link your website with the portal and coming to the portal in fact you can in fact make it look like okay extension of your website itself so that you know even would be seamless event for your customers when they move maybe from your website to the customer support portal that you guys offer right so that they wouldn't feel like you know they moved on to a third party page at the end of the day there so that's typically how you could go about linking where with the set up it is pretty simple case or the boodles you you use the URL that you have and it's based on the URL that you provide here is where you know that's going to be linking back just give me a moment before I open that screen so yeah you know provide a portal URL and it is based on the click with your customers make on your website from which you can direct them on to the sports right.,
