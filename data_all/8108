Okay well we are sort of a specialty market bit of a niche industry we deal Mainly with architects woodworkers know workers it's like there's a I mean it's a pretty vast scope but it's um we we mainly sell hardware so it's like finishing touches for furniture . And there's not a whole lot of competition in the industry but there are some other <>  manufacturers things of that nature that that we do see as direct competitors so we would mostly be interested in refining the SEO for certain keywords like for the parts of themselves so as an example I don't know if you're looking at our page any of those keywords along the left-hand side you know things like economics <> fire management or polls things of that nature so that would be that would be kind of I think the driving factor for getting people getting traffic to this site .,
