so generally it's all on a staging environment so effectively the search context we build out is also on a staging environment that you are team test it out and then they do live for a feed system perspective generally we get the feed in one of these formats I usually told you they either put up on us on an SMTP location or we do an API call to essentially pull out the most updated feed general workarounds is if you don't have in any of these formats then probably will have to write an API script to essentially pull out the feed directly but if you had already using the search server today I'm pretty sure it's being fed to the search server in some manner you just have to figure that out and then use it and essentially replicate something similar run on it we can we can do that either base but yeah we can talk to your tech to even figure out how this has to be done but there are multiple ways to do it.,
