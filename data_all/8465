So on top of this what we have built is as a technology the ability to understand any kind of search query that people are doing on your site today right and this is through the technology and this is where the contextual relevance comes into picture so these are the 12 different types of queries that can actually occur on an e-commerce site and there can't be a query that is outside of this. To give you an example an exact search when I know the exact product number I know the exact product name the Product ID that I'm looking for feature search could be a black dress where black is the feature of the product dress thematic search could be a party dress where party is a theme for the product dress right. And and say slangs or abbreviations in terms of inch being written as double quotes natural language say on an on an on an gifting site or on an apparel site I go and look for Christmas gifts for toddlers right it's important that we understand the intent of the customer because if you search this today on Google Google will start showing you the results and that's exactly what you need to do on an e-commerce site as well. So with us we have built a technology that is able to understand 85 to 90 percent of all these different types of queries I looked at some of these on your site to see how how well this was working to give you an example I was looking for say media filter. Now when I look for media filter and on the left hand side when I look at the filters that you've got within filtran as a brand I could see only three products right so this this my assumption was that you carry three products which are by filtran and which are media filters. The moment I start searching for a filteran media filter i actually got over twelve hundred and eighty products for me as a customer confusing me in terms of what exactly i should be looking at out of these twelve hundred and eighty products then I look for a product type right i look for say an aluminium frame air filter and i'm not sure if this is how people search on your site this is purely my assumption.,
