I understand but let me do this John I'll forward you this information I have Myron to connect with Rick I think one thing that has changed from the last time Monal my colleague who is in Chicago spoke to Rick was the entire segment and target in the personalization product that we have come out with apart from that the search product is probably just improved but most of the core element still remain the same so you can take as feedback I am actually in Chicago the week of 13 so I'm happy to drive down if you have any availability that we can probably do a one-hour in-person and take you through all these elements again .,
