On top of this we do give you the ability to create synonyms but this is specifically for industry jargon so to give you an example for one of our customer who sells to the weight lifting world shoes are called lifters now there is no way we would know shoes are called lifters and also it wouldn't make sense for us to add that synonym into a corpus because lifters might mean totally different thing in in a different industry right.,
