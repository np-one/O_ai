No because you're in your search examples you have size and color we allow people to filter by size and color and she does use those filters a lot so if you go to one our pages like if you go to dresses and filter by right so she can filter by size filter by color or and the filter by category is more for if she's in if more if she's in sale cuz in our sales section that's where I combined the suit separates and dresses but I applied it to all but if she's in dresses she can filter by her size filter by her color and I think she's using that as opposed to search.,
