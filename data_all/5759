because we are doing desktop mobile and tablet we also want to make sure that we work with them so that's one number two is whenever we do the plug-in whoever installs the plugin there is some work that we need to do on our end to create these indexes that as I told you how do we solve gold plates is because we have to tune to you tune our solution to your catalogue so we have to do that work also so we need a little bit of a heads up on that and then the third thing is and I'm sure this will come up in some conversation is what is this going to cost so there are two fees one is one-time setup fee very simple not really expensive and second is the monthly fee the setup fee ranges from $500 to $1000 flat there's no change to it no matter how much work we have to end up doing and it all depends on how much work we do if if the agency is doing most of the work it might be closer to 500 if we are doing a lot of work it might be closer to the thousand dollars okay and the monthly fee varies based on two numbers how big your catalogue size is and how many people that come to your site.,
