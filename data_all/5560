okay task two was medium specific so it's not highly specific but it's not just genetic either it's sort of in the middle citrus fruits okay so thirteen customers use search and twelve use navigation so here you can see they're pretty much equally split and this is pretty typical by the way so forty-five to fifty-five percent of your customers when it's a medium specific task will use either search or navigation it's pretty split in that sense and then the third task was buy anything you like on the site just look for anything you want which is a very low specificity tasks so here majority of them use navigation as you see but there is that small percentage that will still use search and so this is the other end of the spectrum right when the task is highly specific small people use nav navigation more search when this task is low specific very small whole search very high navigation.,
