You know you have a stupid number so from that you can start sifting out the long tail from the ones which are most frequently done and then you know based off of that you can really look at the searches three different weight categories as wire part number and we don't want you you've built that dissection then you can start refining how you do it I mean we might go to suppliers we we do get content from them the challenges that no it's theirs it's their stuff it's not always aligned with the way that that we create our content yeah the structure is not the standardized structure ties that so it's kind of directional but at the end of the day you really need our own stuff to make your website work right so maybe that's being the process that if you know it it's one of those things where you work category by category and so you may go into the neon indicators you tune it . And then you keep on through evolution you're making thousands of change it but those changes collectively will that experience that you start building into your website through improving the tectonic Africa description and then start feeding it with the ability sit in different part number and and then fine tune your accessories and the relevancy of your search results. If we found that if you start working at all the time then that's what makes it there and the problem with outsourcing is no back to your indicator example there there's That's fine that maybe what they have but the man they could also be looking for anemic neo an indicator because they want to replace them with an LCD else last longer their lower power there's a bunch of things that unless you have that knowledge.,
