okay all right so what recommendations would do is especially and it all depends on how you want to fit it into your design okay what recommendations would do it is basically guide the customer based on what their behaviour is on the site so let's start with a homepage you will get two recommendation and generators for the homepage I can show you some examples of that there we go okay so here's two recommendations hand-picked just for you and recently viewed products so what hand pick just for you does essentially is looks at three different algorithms one is the user behaviour second is a product behaviour and third is the <> behaviour what do they all three mean so let's assume that you have a brand new user okay we have no history of what that user's behaviour is so the user behaviour component will automatically go down in weight-age and product behaviour and collaborative behaviour will push up what that means is product behaviour is essentially looking at your catalogue what are your best sellers what are you known for what is moving really well or what customers are clicking on based on that behaviour the product behaviour will start showing those products second the collaborative behaviour is what other customers are seeing from a geography that they're coming from and starting to expose products that they would have never discovered by themselves right so that's and <> view is pretty straight for it's personalised to each user based on what products they've seen last products first then we move into let's say a particular category and let's say we move into this particular category now based on this we can show what are your top sellers in this category and I know they are currently ordered in a certain way but the customers can and should really what that would look like.,
