a completely different example this is expressed as a vertical so here I'm just going to search for let's say jeans and you can see here in apparel you want the customer to get visually engaged you want to capture the customers attention very quickly so large images and a lot of information around it but then we also provide guidance to the customer and you can see here as soon as I hover over any of these details maybe I'm looking for jeans for men I can very quickly get here and navigate down and narrow it down to specifically what I'm looking for so this way I'm also guiding the customer down and then we also provide some popular queries all right.,
