so in solar today the only way to solve a problem like this is to actually page to solve for something long sleeve without space with space it so create a synonym on the back end there is no other way to do that same thing with error correction if I'm looking for cardigan misspelling a cardigan somehow the only way to solve for that is to create a synonym synonym on back end. with Unbxd you do not have to create any kind of synonym on the back end we solved 85% of error mistake out of the box and it's not because you have built its synonym library of all the permutations and combinations of the misspelling it's because we use algorithms to figure out whether the customer has made a spelling mistake in terms of a typo drop the letter transpose letters and we also use recurring neural networks to understand if we suggested a particular correction did the customer interact with it if they did not is there any other possible correction to it that we need to start suggesting and if they interact with that around so that's part of the machine learning components as well is that correct I mean today you guys have spelling mistakes if you see that on the site do you guys have to manually solve that I know that other Hybrids solar customers that we work with do that so I just want to make sure I double chicken validate that as well.,
