one of the things that I tried doing today was to try to test avenet dot com primarily from a search use case standpoint I do understand there's a huge number of paths that you carry so just tested the site itself from a search landscape starting with the relevancy perspective then looked at the UI and when we when it comes to auto suggestion what kind of UI you actually build out then look at error correction synonym objection on the site and then briefly touched upon mobile but again it was the desktop and the search landscape on desktop is what a family spent my time on one one of the things I just wanted to understand I do understand you carry about five million power so when it comes to any kind of error tolerance of the site it could be spell checks it could be singular plural words or any other synonymous words is there an automation algorithm that you guys have built on solar or is it primarily a manual curated list of synonyms that good that you were closing on to the system .,
