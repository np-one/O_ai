Yeah actually when you talk about Ashley right so for them they have over 3000 stores 6600 stores are actually company owned and the others have a franchise kind of a model and they have 19 different pricing zones and the inventory literally changes depending on the location that you're actually coming in from so it's a lot more localization that you'll have to do depending on which state and with City I'm coming in from both from a pricing perspective as well as what products do you actually show people people in that Geo perspective because in furniture the issue is somebody logging into Ashley from say Manhattan the kind of furniture he or she would be looking for will be vastly different from somebody looking for furniture in the Bay Area so there's a lot more localization you have to do when it comes to that.,
