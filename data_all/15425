The way we solved it for one of our customers a Debora Lipman for actually most of our customers if we give the customer the ability to continue their journey in two ways. One is giving this recently viewed widget out here meaning the customer can go back to what they were looking at so far on your site or making the appropriate recommendations these recommendations are made based on what they have been doing on your website or what other kind of products and what are they most likely to buy we would start recommending the price so the customer doesn't have to go to the search bar they can they can start their journey where once again by clicking on any one of these products or our widgets and they can go to. Search results a similar product so then I am looking for Nike shoes 100 shoes I just love one shoe and there could be several reasons right it could be the color I cook the price point it could be various different reasons why I love that shoes and we give the ability for you to show similar products in a modal Window the customer clicks on the similar products link here a modal window opens up shows similar quickly shows you know quite a few similar products customer light so they can click on the product and go ahead they don't like it they can quickly close the modal window and continue looking at the products what they were on the site all right it's an all here's an alternative for the same feature on mobile.,
