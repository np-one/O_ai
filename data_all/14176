that's essentially from the algorithm that we built for understanding natural language and and yeah so you know that's the auto suggest you know we covered the relevancy part of it you know the error tolerance similarly with synonyms you know that that's not something that you have to build in manually you know that's a yeah let's say let me go back to your sides here for a second I'm just trying to see okay so here's an example you have a category where it says beaded silk light yarn so somebody were to misspell beaded for instance you know Unbxd would still show the relevant results and similarly let's say now now the colors might be very specific to your site like monitor with gold if somebody had to like Google monitored gold you know there's no way that our system would have encountered that but the interesting piece that you know the technology does on the background is you know once we've implemented our solution in the one to two weeks you know our system understands that somebody's searching for monitored with gold is looking for this specific colour and it's able to show show relevant results as well.,
