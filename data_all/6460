on my question would be we have quite a small catalogue and we don't have like a really wide breadth of different categories and types of products we offer so I think the examples you guys pulled out we're great a showing kind of searching for categories we do have is having problems but we're also not the size of maybe Express or a lot of other brands you know like there'd be times where we don't have a search or we don't like we don't have even some pretty common pieces um is there so as much of an opportunity for search even with this small catalogue.,
