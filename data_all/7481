Yah we do so our marketing team from outsider I mean we send a lot of emails out as well so those items get prioritized and be in the site currently so it's it's several hundred items maybe put six the catalog of items is about 1000 so it's relatively small when we feed information to Google we do bid adjustments based on profit margins and things like that so it's functionality that we don't have currently but something that we would be interested in to on this on the site as well so.,
