um so we based on your catalogue size because you have so many variations the 40 K variations that we have to store that itself is a big cost factor for us unfortunately let me do what I can do let me see what I can do to figure this out I was able to get the navigation for free because I wanted to make sure that if you're able to help you I really would like you to try to see if we can help you or not if let's say the navigation thing doesn't work out okay because you have more navigation than search right obviously so navigation is going to be a bigger cost for us and so if navigation does work out where we increase your speed and help you resolve that problem the navigation is free that I would hope you will see that as a huge discount if navigation doesn't work out we're we're not in helping you improve the speed at all then navigation is free or you pay doesn't really mean anything right so for the 750 let me see what I can do I'll run it up the flagpole to figure out based on the storage cost what can we do to manipulate and I'll definitely try to come back with the best price for you .,
