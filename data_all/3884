and let us say you have a client who is ready to who's going to demo your product and he is right now in the demo stage if the person is going to buy the product and he's ready to buy the part you can just click the deal and you can drag it down to the bottom and move it to the one stage you can rather move it to the last stage if he's not interested or just delete the deal out of the system as well you can further move between stages right by dragging and dropping or if you feel dragging and dropping is kind of like a clumsy way to do it you can also go inside the deal and just move it so this is because I'm getting this error because I have a mandatory field so once I have a pre-sales contact set I will be able to move the stage.,
