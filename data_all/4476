do you remember example we had shown will be there were two spellings of refrigerator they were showing up as suggestions that was because you have created those synonyms for all the different permutations and combinations of our refrigerators could be spelled or misspelled with Unbxd is 100% of standards are solved out of the box 85 to 90 percent of spelling mistakes solved out of the box and synonyms we also generate a lot of the synonyms connection and a process of enemy we call it using it on your catalogue and about 150 to 200 million products that we've indexed over time in our system .so here like they see I'm in a simple mistake nice it's a mover with only 100 and you can see the system start to result start to slow up and the last piece was obviously from a usability perspective the mobile experience was also pretty critical so if I were to now let's say and I know we have very little time left so I'll just smush this a little bit it's the same thing with the mobile experience I think that you know from an experience perspective the autocomplete is exactly the same it's just narrowing down to fit a mobile screen but you know from a mobile experience perspective it's extremely important to again guide the customer and you don't have enough space to show images and stuff and right now the idea is with mobile.,
