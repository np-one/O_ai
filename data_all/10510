and and this is all assumptions obviously so whats my suggestion was to let's just take a look at it from both perspectives both deployment and second is price so let me do this let me switch it up a little bit let me go with the implementation first and then we can very quickly talk about price because just give me a hint I mean am I correct in assuming that we are priced higher than your current implementation correct.,
