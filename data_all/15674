It wouldn't really do both or what. It would be like if if you do this besides such it would still be around two thousand dollars in non we have the set a fee because what happens is our analytics piece and some of the some of the things remain right so that's why we recommend customers to implement both together separately it might cost much higher than what I've given you now the other thing if you have if you want to evaluate both together what I can also do is for the first 60 days I can give you site search so we can what we do is typically we give a 50% POC engagement model meaning during the first 60 days you pay us 50 percent right which is thousand dollars thousand dollars for the first first two months now post the two months from at the on the 61st today of going live you will have you can make a decision whether you want to continue with Unbxd or not if you plan to continue with Unbxd that's the point where you pay the remaining 50% for the last two months am I am i clear .,
