Endeca is not a contextual relevance engine it gives you the ability to do product discovery and gives you some ability to do merchandising for category pages but when you get into the search pages it becomes the extremely difficult to do in with Endeca you can solve it by manually sorting products but that's not a scalable solution because I can look for the same product in a hundred different ways and that's where I need to really solve the contextual relevance so that's the other piece that we're seeing different the third piece is from a perspective of customer success or in terms of the scale aspect. Where you talk about filters let's say we talk about I want to show different kinds of filters for different categories of products you can't do that in Endeca unless you manually set that up without Unbxd with automatically scales third thing is in terms of the manual effort that you might be spending today is solving error Corrections and stemming problem so Apple versus Apple's yogurt versus different misspellings of yogurt everything is to solve all of those systems all of those issues today within Endeca you have to create a synonym with Unbxd you do not have to create a synonym 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box and it's not because we've built a synonym library on our end it is because we've actually using algorithms to solve these spelling Mistakes. The second the last piece is in terms of the integration so if you were to use Unbxd to solve site search you do not have to replace Endeca we can sit right next to Endeca so you can continue you might have years of processing built on top of Endeca so you just can't to keep Endeca away you don't have to do that for using an Unbxd the way Unbxd does that is today your Application for.,
