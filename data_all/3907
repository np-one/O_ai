definitely so let's say you have four accounts ABCD and you would like to run two campaigns for one for a B and the second one for C and B so what you could do is you could just create a custom field saying campaigns and we actually have a field called campaigns by default so you can just give a campaign name and then assign that particular campaign name to those accounts so I would assign campaign one to a and B and campaign to to C and D and further when I'm going to run my campaign I can use the filter option that I have on the right hand side to just filter by camping or because I don't have the field query that I could use any custom fields such as campaign or campaign tour right here so I could just type in the campaign and it will just bring in all my campaign 1 accounts and I can just bulk select all those accounts I can just bulk select all those campaign 1 accounts and shoot in bulk shoot in bulk email.,
