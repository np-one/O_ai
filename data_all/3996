Another important thing as I told you is the cross sell widget which is based on the wisdom of crowd theme right. This is where we start understanding okay five out of the ten people who probably buy a humidifier on the site also buy a filter for the humidifier so show a filter when somebody is buying humidifier. These are decisions that the system starts making on the fly another one is an upsell widget right I am buying the nail colour on the site and there is data to support that five out of the ten people who buy a nail colour also buy a lip colour. So we upsell a lip colour when somebody is buying a nail colour or we up sell nail colour when somebody is buying a lip colour so we can show those kind of widgets.,
