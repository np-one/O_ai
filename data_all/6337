yeah I mean you know from our side at least the your side we're already pretty convinced that if we're implement a solution such as this that we would certainly see an uptick in and conversions sir so it's you know and there's there's other things that we'd love to do you know such as I personally think cross selling is something we should really you know whether it's you know we we barely do any cross selling or up selling right now I mean if we send out a better cart triggers there's a little bit of it done with that but you know at the checkout you know shopping cart page we don't typically have any cross selling we do there also what they said you know the site search is pretty terrible where as you already saw if you're typing in digital watches or wall clocks or whatever it is you know right now it pretty much only works based on the attributes that are set at the product level and to be honest are we have a data what do you call it product management team that's entering that data and frustrating because half the time it's either incomplete or you know not totally correct or whatever it is so that conflicts with you know some of our search capability there also it's a customer mission types something they pretty much got to type its spot on or it's not gonna pull up so right now they have to kind of know the name of it or at least the partial name of you know the actual name of the watch which it is I'm pretty limiting or.,
