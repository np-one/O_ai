I mean I I mean I know that and in fact I'm I was really surprised to see how lower percentage it was and I went back in time to see if it had changed my scene it hasn't them is I was kind of really surprised because I know it's my own experience you know it seems like in the old age people were much more likely you searched them on navigation so but whatever that's what it is so I mean one of the things I guess one of the other big questions but I'm not concerned about with Unbxd is there's there's several different kinds of search one of them is called a hosted search right where you can basically just use where the search all sort of takes place on their site as opposed to our site and I think that is that what and so it's also very easy to implement where basically you're you're basically just pulled you're scanning all of our pages and then creating a result based on that as opposed to having a product feed and at this point we sort of have a product feed that we use for google shopping so we don't we because we don't have a database we don't have a real product feed right so does your system require a real product feeds.,
