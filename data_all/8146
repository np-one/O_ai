Search for countertop support legs here are the results that I see a lot of them being non relevant some of them not even being support legs right these are surely not supporting it these are some sort of keyboard platforms right some of the I think these are some sort of grommets maybe but primarily non-relevant results now now as a customer I I feel that you do not have enough countertop support legs and I would move I would go back to Google or I would go back to Amazon or any other site and look for the right set of products and I might be interested right . So this is where I spoke about the gap right so the marketing is doing their job right that they're able to get the traffic or to the side but what happens when there is there is other organic traffic coming on the site are you able to convert and and that's where we come in the picture and we help you improve the conversion rate for these kind of customers who come on to your site and search for problems.,
