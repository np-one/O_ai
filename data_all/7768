like say example right so I could I could have men casual shoes or shoes as a vertical or casual shoes as a sub vertical where I define that these are the set of attributes that I want to define for this specific subcategory right A will give you an option to define them right and B once you define them as a user I can come and search for men casual shoes men formal shoes I did I need not even have to have the word shoes on it would be men's Nike men's  Adidas the results will show in the same order of attribution and then after the few days we figure if width is the most clicked attribute weight to the automatically move up top front you don't have to do anything manually right .,
