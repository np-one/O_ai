So when I when I see those products I actually noticed that you show the primary image of the product right so there's a white draw or a white I think it was a drawer or a chest that is being shown I'm sorry the cubicle organiser and if I have to see the one in black then I have to go and click on the swatch the black swatch and to probably see the see the image. But with us we have built a technology that is able to identify right the right product for a search results page so to give you an example say a red dress not if you have red dresses if you have the red red dress image as I would say for the that particular variants available the system will be able to automatically pull up the red dress image and start showing them as for the search results right unlike the gray and the black and the blue that is that's being shown here in this example. Then the result page we take care of the zero result page highly personalized for each user in real time by showing them recently viewed products and recommendations which are which are typically based on their behaviour on the site their affinities towards a brand towards colour towards a price point so let me now jump onto the merchandising controls and let me actually walk you through a live demo of it rather that showing you some of the screenshots.,
