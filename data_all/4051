So what we'll do is after this call we will send you the same presentation I used for this call as an email plus I'll also send you an implementation document. You can go and review all the information and if you have any questions you can let us know and then we can probably get on a call again next week if you I can get an engineer on the call as well. And if you have any more technical questions you can ask that person and then we can go ahead accordingly.,
