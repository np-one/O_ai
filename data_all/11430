I know so what we do is we also develop from that perspective a both I think you have an adaptive instance so one for desktop one one for mobile and our solution will be adaptive as well so it's not twice the amount of work it's slightly maybe 15% more work for us to configure slightly differently because some elements might be different on mobile but it's not 2x the work.,
