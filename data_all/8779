So the with us you do not have to create any any redirects right the system is able to understand the big categories right so say you have a category sneakers now someone comes onto the side and looks first me even if they were click a sneaker and the system is able to understand that and then and redirects the customers automatically to the sneakers page for the most obvious ones but for say something out apart from sneakers or sandals if you want someone looking for sandals to be redirected to the sneakers page that is something you can do from our back-end dashboard let me let me actually quickly take you to the dashboard here. Did you see the Unbxd merchandising dashboeard screen.,
