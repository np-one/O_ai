However that white top will still be in the search results because it still has the word jeans in it even though it may not be contextually relevant to a human to a machine it's still a relevant search result. So what we did was a second component that we apply is called the search results exclusion we trained our algorithm through a product catalog of almost 200 million products to start to understand that jeans is the product white is the colour attribute and women's is the gender attribute okay. Because of this it now understood that a white top is not white jeans so we were able to exclude the white top and maybe even push on other jeans that might be below that white top in terms of the ranking. The third thing that we did was understand the user behaviour so we deploy analytics on say kirklands dot com and we track every single click the customer makes on the site whether they're searching or not searching. And based on that we create a user behaviour score now this user behaviour score is actually tracked per query so women's white jeans will have its own score white jeans will have its own score women's jeans will have its own score jeans will have its own score. So every single query will have its own score and we will find what is your best performing product for that query and we'll reorder the results by showing the best performing product up top.,
