right so it should be more clear that way and then it also solve for things like say if I look for returns on the site right it should automatically take me to that specific landing page where you have stored policies and returns and not make me go and find it it should redirect me to this page or even if I have to found a store I'm in New York today if I want to find a store near me right it should take me to that section where it's showing me all the stores to near all right .,
