Head query search say I was looking for mobile in this example right the intent is yet not clear whether the person was looking for a mobile phone head phone cases we have technology that identifies the right subcategories for the given search query and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity right.  So Mobile's being the most popular that's the first category then headphones then cases and then headsets but not only that we start immediately showing results for the most popular or the most important category and that here being mobile we also start showing the results from mobile.,
