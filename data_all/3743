yep that makes complete sense there's because you know this is the exact way in which you know that we have this option to merge tickets so it could be where it could be the same customer who sent out me me two different threads so now instead of maintaining it as two threads what you could do is you could choose them and merge that specific ticket right you can merge it based on the requesters name or based on the ticket ID that you have right so once you do that you have them merge and it's only going to be a single you know channel of communication that goes out which will definitely reduce on the redundancy then.,
