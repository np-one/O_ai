And these are some of the things I'm sure there is an entire team working on making this work right for you but our whole logic was why do you have to build this manually when you actually have a system which can do this automatically for you I'll give you a quick example while we're on this like I I think we spoke about this black leather jacket example right if I have to now misspell the word black leather jacket and which are all the three words to be honest spell it as say blck leathe jaket okay one thing we have done is we've made the system trained where it can autocorrect all the words and also show you result from the word book and the same thing goes for different stemmed words like t-shirts spelt in different ways right t-shirts T - shirts T space shirts and tees without you having to build a manual list of synonyms how can we automatically lead you to the right set of results.,
