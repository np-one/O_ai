if there is anything that you want me to look at right with regards to pricing I would be more than happy to work on that obviously we I will not be able to match up next OPR pricing.  but between search Spring and SLI if there is something between that price point right I can I can surely work on it given we are ready to close this immediately and then get onto the integration piece quickly we can surely work on the pricing pricing is set apart because we know that that once we start delivering value you will be more than happy to pay us.,
