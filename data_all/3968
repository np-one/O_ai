This is actually the largest online grocery store in Southeast Asia they were in the news last week because they raised about hundred fifty million dollars and series B funding. So here if you go to their site and they had a specific business use case one their analytics showed that on an average customers would buy about eighteen to twenty products in a single transaction. So they wanted the fastest way to add products to cart and second they wanted the entire thing to be to be completely personalized. Like if I as a user probably buy go to a grocery store and buy say egg milk and chicken every week how can you show these products on top to me so that I can pick those products a lot more faster that was their use case.,
