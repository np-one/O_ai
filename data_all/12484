okay so lot of different ways in which you can happy order suggest the first one that you see here on the left hand side this is a side by side order suggest so the way it works is the first thing that you see here is what we call the guided autosuggest so basically we segment the data based on categories subcategories product type brand or any of these other attributes and then try and segregate the data based on that then someone starts searching in for something so if here in this example if someone is searching for t-shirts we have segmented the data based on brands and as somehow a user clicks on any of these brands they will see the results for t-shirts with the filter Nike or puma as they select so that's guided search then we have the popular product section now this section is based on or the real-time analytics tracking and aggregation that we do for the product clicks or active carts cards and the orders so based on all of this data which we keep checking which are the most popular products for any specific way that is being typed in so based on this aggregation we come up with the popular products then we have the top query section again this is something that is populated through our analytics intubation we keep a check a real-time check on the queries that are being searched for on the side and we keep aggregating and based on this we come up with the top queries   list depending on you know what the query is typed in you will start seeing in the top queries coming in we then have the keyword suggestions section now this is something that is controlled from the backend this can be configured based on some of the important attributes coming in from your end again this is something which is set by unboxed third team internally based on some of the best practices and you know basically just going through some your previous data to see how people are trying to search for products on the side and then coming up with the right combinations for example it could be category it could be a brand plus category it could be a color plus product type it could be any of these combinations so it's just a matter of configuring that from the back end to get that working within the auto suggest so these are the core sections but they're lot of a phase in which you can show this data it could have two box or a suggests to be a single box auto suggest it was a test you can change the position where you see any of these coming in all of that can be controlled from our side just want to know what I also do is I'll probably send you around eight to ten different kinds of layouts there we've done for some of our other customers you can go through that list and then let us know which one which design you like the best .,
