so that's one approach however there could be concerns with this approach specifically if you are looking for you know having that whole pricing structure being different off at any user logging onto the site now that will tell now that you've told me about it this may not be the very the best way of going with this so my ended way would be going with the ajax implementation this is the in page ajax implementation wherein we will provide you a java script from our end that will just replace the you know results div within the search page only the listing part where you're listening for the products that div will actually show results coming in from the unbox ID so we will only be replacing that one the header and footer everything at your end so it's just that you are placing our JavaScript directly on your head so we will give the JavaScript your team implement set and everything you know works inherently on your site itself now what advantage of this pieces again a lot of implementation work will still happen on our end just like how it's on the bullshit page because we are will be providing you that and this will also take care now I'm sure that there will be can figure out a way in which the pricing can be different for every user I am sure you are currently doing it in a specific way at your end maybe we could use the same scripts the same JavaScript on these pages also to ensure that in real time the price is changing for these users based on whether he or she is locked in or not so this is how we've done for some of our other clients and that's where I'm coming from.,
