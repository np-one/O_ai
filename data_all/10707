The price depends on various different factors these are the elements right basically in terms of how many products they have what's their site visits or page views especially with recommendations and based on that I can I can give you a pricing. So say typically if someone was at 5000 products 100000 sessions a month that that would cost like $1000 a month right that's a very high level understanding of the price but as it grows the price doesn't double but yeah the price still goes a little higher.,
