and then synonyms again just to repeat myself you don't have to go and create any synonyms the machine will learn by itself but if there is a new product that you introduce and on day one you want the system to work really well and you want to manually add a synonym because it's a new product and you believe that a lot of people will come and buy it we give you an option to add a synonyms and the finding unidirectional or bi-directional equivalent and this is very very optional you don't have to do that system will do itself right.,
