No no no no what I'm what I meant was I don't want to say like today we're more or less using elasticsearch as a kind of like a document database right so you can dynamically add attributes whatever we want just use this as filters so this makes it super easy we can more or less bypass the database directly just for directing elasticsearch because that's where it's gonna be used and that's where it makes sense to keep it things like that where it would make we kind of like to keep that control you understand what I'm saying .,
