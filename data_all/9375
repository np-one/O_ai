And this is ever changing it's not just one time and done it is constantly doing applying the machine learning techniques to understand how the buying behaviour from customers might change. Because you might actually reduce the price on this or you might have a newer product that that is starting to show some trends we want to make sure that we start to show the best performing products in that moment up top. However the fourth component is also important the algorithm may take care of a lot of things from that perspective but sometimes the business also needs a certain certain output that the business may have an expectation to say I have a particular product. Very high in inventory I just want to get rid of it and either you put it on sale or clearance but based on the algorithm it might not show up top because it's not the best profile product which is why it's still so much left in inventory. So you have the opportunity to merchandise and boost some of these products so you can boost a product but in typically with say searching promoters from other tools you might in the paths of considered say Endeca or some other traditional solutions. The boosting has a big limitation you'll boost a product in a particular you boost a particular product to solve one query what will happen is we don't you don't you won't know you know how much boosting you need to give to make sure that that product shows up top.,
