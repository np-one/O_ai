So I've really been watching her behavior and how she interacts with our site with our products and it's different than any other brand I've ever worked with and I've worked with many so I don't know if it's just because it's so new and that's why she's window shopping so much so if is the behavior gonna change six months from now when I have more products on the site but there's a lot of turnover so it's it's rare that I have products that live on the site more than a couple of months.,
