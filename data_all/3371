so that was the one of the search results and on this tour four of them will abandon now obviously we paid these guys to be there so they didn't abandon but what they what the typically say is oh I don't know what to do or what should I do next when they ask those types of questions we know that if they were by themselves that they were all abandoned site then essentially one more thing that would you okay here's a lot of analysis around this but a low specific task maybe ask them to look for something specific so on Samsung they look for camera and there was shown results for a battery homepage banners this type of product name instead of epilator she was shown zero results for spelling mistakes so instead of oh she typed it in he I wish we had done a more consistent job on this I apologize Alex comparison stage this is the next stage where we now actually figure out and say okay now that you've moved  down to a product that you were looking for how do you actually buy next so they talked about you know how easy is wanting to see similar product recommendations the site did not show any and next was but they did say they were able to find all the information they were looking for very easily so if they have the real and they are true intends to buy and the preview page is doing its job in terms of providing all the details but if they have no intent to buy from any user experience perspective it's not very easy to navigate to the next level so if I find this particular product say Abel planets headphones I want to see another set of headphones I have to go back and then click on the next product so to see second product I have to do almost three clicks right then the checkout stage was users were shown saying cross-sell recommendations on the card page as well as in the as well as in the process of the checkout so the idea is that if I was shown some popular new products and ones that I had in the basket I were considered buying them so that's you know user were not shown any recommendations on the checkout state so that was definitely a an opportunity and then the return stage this is something I personally had my experience on one of the other sites was Saturday morning 8 o'clock I'm spending time on the site I spend almost half an hour kids come into the room eight hours passed by before I get back to the site I've already forgotten what I was looking at so we wanted to figure out what will the site do to help me get back to where I had left off so to recreate that scenario we asked all these focus group participants to sort of take a 15 minute break come back restart and to remember what they were looking to buy come back and find that product again and they still couldn't search they could still navigate they could still use whatever mechanism they want to use but unfortunately only two users were able to recall the products and they found it difficult to spot the ones they viewed earlier so recommendations recently view recommendations would definitely help for repeat customers and then we basically have all our customer feedback and suggestions based on that customer feedback as to how you can address and improve some of these pieces what is it that you need to look at and then we have all our key takeaways grouped by each stage so product discovery what happens selection stage checkout the <> cetera and that's the so if the customer experience study for you so Alex one of the things what we can do is we're gonna repeat it with gene dot and an AT&T dot works like specifically just looking at that assuming that a customer lands there directly and not even worried about the main factory outlet stores homepage.,
