yeah so what we can do is more rather than calling it a/b test before and after so let's say you have this white space here we can put something else here we can keep the future right here where it is you can add something here if you want to and you can see what the performance of that particular widget is over time so before the widget got added what was the performance or the click hatred was after the widget was added what was it and based on the feedback if we tuned it what's in the new hit weight and the reporting on based on that absolutely so we can do it that way because a trying to Ab test absence or presence of it will require you to deploy an a/b testing tool .,
