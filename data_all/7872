And like some of the examples on this is if you take the example of say a woman's white jeans if you understand most of the search algorithms are built with the traditional TF-IDF logic which essentially ranks a particular term of a query highest depending on its rarity or popularity so in this context of women's white jeans it will rank since white is the rarest it will rank it with the highest number it will give its the highest IDF score and it will give the lowest IDF score to jeans but an e-commerce context actually jeans is most important right because you have to first find jeans then you have to find something which is in the color of white and then you have to find something which is suitable for women and then show products so that is how we've built our algorithm which is why our relevance is slightly better.,
