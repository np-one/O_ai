Coremetrics got it so typically depending on how Coremetrics or even Google or Omniture are deployed a lot of times they might be overstating what the actual search conversion might be I'll give you an example let's say I search for dog food I didn't get good results for example and then I navigated to dog and then dog food and I clicked on the category on the navigation and ended up buying the product that I wanted to buy what Coremetrics might end up saying is that that search session had a conversion so you might think that dog food had a conversion but in reality dog food did not have a conversion right so this is where Unbxd actually tracks a one-to-one correlation if I search for dog food and I do not buy from search that conversion is not attributed to the query dog food so our conversions per query is actually usually reports smaller than what Coremetrics or Omniture would typically report so now that that being said I could now come in and say that okay dresses is converting I'd say three point five two percent I can drill down into that query and look at again the same analysis that I was seeing at the overall query level what is my trend over time so let's say on 15th of January I made some merchandising changes and the search results actually went down and I made some more changes on the sixteenth and it actually went back up I can actually see what that trend changed looks like and I can also see what my funnel would look like as to how many hits clicks carts and orders did I actually get from this particular query for that time frame that's the am I is that the question you were asking Conner.,
