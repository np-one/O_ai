the next piece what I really wanted to also highlight was couple of other things one was after a customer searches let's say I search for flags and I wasn't necessarily sure which flags I was looking for although there are countries and a lot of products and eras clearly defined right the question here is any query that I fire the filters which is the next most important thing from a customer experience perspective it's pretty standard and now the products that you sell are definitely in a certain niche however I would certainly imagine that if I'm looking for say knives or swords yes maybe military or nation or conflict might be very important in terms of how customers narrative involves town but it's also important to note that there are certain attribution to those categories that'll become more important I don't know whether that's true or not out there because giving the customers the same standard filters doesn't necessarily help it make it easy for them to narrow the results down if you realize that for certain categories of products certain filters are more important you can easily do that or navigation right if you wanted to come in and say let's do headgear I want to do helmets for helmets you can easily say you know something but let's assume that is Lucas travel down a strap size for example right head size is clearly important then maybe that's what's more important to show up top versus if I'm looking for a sword maybe the lens the material whatever that case may be so in navigation it's pretty straight forward because you have a very different hats the customers going down however you can search that is not the case so what Unboxd allows you to do is also allows you to create very specific filters without any manual effort I might do I want repeat that without any manual effort to be automatically pick that up when if you defined it for the navigation category which is the last thing from any user experience I wanted to share so that's that's that I know syllabus is pretty good on spell check so if I were to you know maybe misspell something like this you know it will figure out that maybe I'm looking for headgear just be careful there's some copy here like an HTML copy.,
