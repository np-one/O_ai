yeah sixonmy correct and so or the footers for that matter you know if you don't make changes that often then obviously there's nothing really that needs to be changed that frequently and eventually you can see and you can do a very quick test using it using it this way right you do the hosted search you can quickly test are we producing better results than your current provider and that is where our 90-day ROI sort of guarantee comes in you don't pay us anything for the first 90 days you compare us to your current provider and only if you're happy that you may want to then say okay this is making us more money to justify to assign resources to actually do it from the backend so we have so you guys have full control but a lot of customers continue using the hosted search approach also for for a long time like you saw in Rob's example they've been using this for over a year now and with no complaints at all so either way it's fine even for the long term or the short term but hosted approach takes away a lot of the effort from your team puts you in our lab so that's the implementation  .,
