Okay so I can know so in terms of which filters you would want you would want to create those and we create that as part of the implementation right so and this is based on not on an item but on the category. So to give you an example then this will give you a better feel of it so say for shoes as a category as part of the implementation are even after implementation so you would want to go and set it and very easily you can set it from our dashboard. So for shoes as a category you would want size ankle height width casual shoe type very specific filters for shoes right you can go into the dashboard and say for shoes as a category these are the filters that I need right. Now every time someone searches for shoes and they might search as man men's casual shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes.,
