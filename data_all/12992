Central On February the 10th so what we can do John is in the meantime I'll send you the the deck so you can talk about it internally also send you an agreement that outlines the price that we talked about etc so you can see exactly what we're gonna do and we can also set up we can also request a couple of pieces if you don't mind I mean I'm assuming you use Google Analytics today right so if you don't mind giving us a read-only access to your Google Analytics once you are in agreement that you want to move forward okay you don't have to do that until then so and also give us access to one of your themes if you can make a copy of the production theme and then give us access to that so we can actually see what the catalog looks like all that so we can do some of the homework and the legwork up front we can go on the 10:00 schedule an implementation call outline what exactly what you're gonna do what you're gonna do you sign the agreement before that after that how are you feel comfortable and once we provide the timelines to you you sign off on it we'll get started.,
