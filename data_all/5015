so that was and third was the lower specificity tasks where it basically told users to find what they want somebody went looking for climbing supplies you search the query and got zero results you later basically turn to navigation and one user basically went and look for casual caps use the navigation bar and basically found what he wanted and and basically what people said was probably more subcategories in the navigation but there's something that he help the increase will improve the search experience so this is more of a suggestion that user gave us another thing is one user we made a spelling mistake and that came up with zero results so that's one thing that in the last 12 months we hadn't Boxter specifically worked extremely hard on we can basically even within a single single keyword if there are two letters that are misspelled we will still show you the relevant results even if there are six mistakes in a single phrase we still show you the relevant results I mean we couldn't go beyond six because with the permutation and combination involved the backend logistics and the entire computation would have got so complicated that we couldn't have adhered to our 250 second milliseconds basically availability timeouts so but not something that we really worked on so when when we when do when we do spelling mistake we make sure that any kind of mistakes which is sounding similar which is sounding synonymous of a particular variant of a particular category or sure like that so that was something that just want to share.,
