There you go so you can see if you were to let the consider solar or elasticsearch as a replacement for Endeca what you typically get is that box in the middle what solar and Elasticsearch give you is extremely fast search and both of them inherently have usual seen underneath it right . Solar is just a wrapper for producing and elasticsearch is another version of how the wrapper around the scene really works so we've actually gone into the scene and we have there are about 30 or 35 committers routine commuters in the world two of them work for us and this is where we tackle theme and then we've built all the blue boxes around this particular component to make it better search solutions so if you look at the top right corner which is ecommerce context awareness. This is where we build our semantic relevance engine the context of our engine those are spell check our own synonym corpus for a lot of aspects you index the world catalog where we have scanned almost a hundred thousand ecommerce sites index almost 200 million products in our own catalogue to build our own synonym corpus then on top of that we all you automatically get the autocomplete someone like I showed out of the box on the Left top left you get yourself learning algorithm this is where you get user behavior we've learned this is machine learning components where we start to figure out what products are performing better and then on top of that we also have our personalization component where we start to percolate product that you have bought in the past right. And then and then you have the infrastructure at the bottom bottom left where all of this analysis is done in real time you know there is a huge component of machines that are being spent in real time every minute to try to do a real-time data analysis and it's obviously scales depending on whether you have peak season not peak season the system will automatically scale on the back end and then the right bottom corner is again your merchandise ultimate the business still need control over how the algorithms work because the algorithm can work great but the business ultimately wants control to make sure that they can influence the algorithm for what the business needs.,
