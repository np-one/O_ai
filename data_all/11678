So that's typically we approach today we can talk about that so what we usually do is we discuss the pricing once everything is done then the only expectation from customer is whatever is the implementation of the setup fee the customer pays a small portion of that and nothing else for the next 90 days. So we put our skin in the game we implement the solution you use the product and after 90 days you take a decision whether to move ahead or not if you do not move ahead everything else is waived so you don't have to pay anything else you don't have to pay either remaining of the implementation fee or the monthly fee.,
