well at least so that's a different case scenario but let's assume that we you did not carry a particular product and there is a way a possibility that you got a zero results page what we believe in today's DNA customer gets the wrong that you want to give them the option to go back or to go forward so recently view gives them the ability to go back recommendations give them the ability to go forward you know and these recommendations are unboxd recommendations and I get you have lists track recommendations so what my suggestion would be at least for the zero results page use whatever list track widgets are and use them.,
