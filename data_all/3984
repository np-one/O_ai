But most of these filters are manually configured what Unbxd does is it also gives you the option to build dynamic filters. For example if you find men's casual shoe as a popular category and if you feel that there are specific set of attributes that you have to define for men casual shoes right. The reason it's called dynamic is because once you define this for men's casual shoes as a user I can come and search as many formal shoes men party shoes. I don't even have to have the word shoes in it it could be men's Nike men's Adidas the results will appear with the same attributes you don't have to go and define a specific filter for everything.,
