And this is only possible through contextual relevance by understanding the intent of the customer that the Unbxd system is able to do today then I looked at search speed this was actually worrying for for a few of your queries that I tried your search speed was over 2000 milliseconds which is which is surely a red signal something that you need to look at. It should be less than three milliseconds as as per industry standards 500 milliseconds is something that's okay anything five more than 500 milliseconds is surely something to be worried about and to be looked into but in your case I noticed that being more than 2000 milliseconds. And we provide an SLA for your search results page the results would be would be delivered below 300 milliseconds in reality actually 90% and above search results pages are actually rendered within 100 milliseconds here is an example for that this is for Express and this is a test that was done on Black Friday one of the busiest day on on the Express site right during the Black Friday sale and one of our engineer actually they happen to do this test and then pull up this image which we also shared with Express and now Ashley guys are using it for our references.,
