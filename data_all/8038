even I'm surprised Amazon is pretty big in India but yeah there's some Unbxd it probably a very extensive Dubai right now so there doesn't need to be making but yeah their use cases fairly simple that I think was very similar to what you spoke about they have 42 products in a transaction that's the average cart size a lot of repeat buying and they also have a huge buying behaviour on tablets and mobile phones as well in India most retailers have the same thing more than 50 to 70% of the traffic to mobile devices so what they did was essentially this so they wanted to add 42 products you end up going to 150 clicks they wanted quick add to kart option because in grocery you don't have to literally examine a lot of things you want to buy it's probably the same products you want to buy so what they did is essentially if I want to look at buying chicken we've built an auto fill functionality where you can change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box.,
