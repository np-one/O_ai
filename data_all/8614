Absolutely and I and I think you know what I was trying to say you're Absolutely correct auto industry I mean they've been around for a hundred and twenty years so they have no choice but to organize a little bit better and not having an industry standard is okay what I think the challenge here Chris is you have the data I mean we talked about hundred and twenty five words right and I can see here in the filters I did filter 125 volts and the still and this product still seems to show up so you have the attribution data you have the actual content data maybe some of the categorization could be optimized that's absolutely true from a navigation perspective but we believe that with the data that you have and this is obviously something you can test but we believe that with the data that you have in the filters that data the way you organized it we have the capacity to solve queries like the neon indicators like 125 volt neon indicators while you're still continuing to using Endeca to optimize some of your single word queries and more frequent queries because you're single more queries probably has more traffic and your long tail queries does not have that much traffic but your long term queries probably make up 40 maybe 50 percent of your query base and 50 percent of your single word query maybe 16 percent a single work queries so how do you optimize that 40 percent you clearly cannot do that today with Endeca at scale that's number one number two is the ability to optimize is still manual you still have to do a lot of development on the back end to able to move the needle from say 60% to 65% and we believe and and I obviously I this is looking from the outside in mind you Chris so this is not that we're coming in and being cocky enough to say oh we solved autoparts world we can solve yours that's clearly not the statement we were making what based on the data that I see and the data that is already organized the queries that we ran and had an opportunity we know that we can easily fix those. One last thing I wanted to show you because it is a b2b world let's say I start to type in this  125 volt neon indicator something along those lines or.,
