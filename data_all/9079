Phases so if I have a dishwasher with space without space bathtub with space without space or drill bit toilet seat right I think about it this way I can simplify an example if I'm searching for doors or doorknob when I'm searching for doorknobs I don't want to show doors how do we do that we need to know that doorknobs is a different product than tools right and same thing that organization helps us do that is that we know that Bosch is the product round hammer is the feature and a drill bit is the actual product and that is where the usage of the knowledge graph also comes in. We've built this corpus when when we talk about that world catalog indexing the products almost 200 million products within our catalog we've built this knowledge graph to identify how its in term can be correlated to another term from that perspective. And and these sources are obviously your own catalog but we also so then post-processing of the each toconisation and applying the knowledge that we now understand that Bosch is the brand around hammer is the feature drill bit is the actual prototype. And then we do some data enrichment based on this synonym corpus that we've also build is there loop at try to figure out to pay we need to talk about it but there is drill bit or driver bit because we've seen that that's both names are interchangeable sometimes so that becomes the actual query into the scene and then we do the semantic relevancy where if you think about solar for example by default it uses a algorithm called TF IDF right now TF IDF is is the gold standard in search but it is not the gold standard in search for e-commerce because tf-idf only gives you a priority or popularity it does not give you usefulness. Right so we have to do this technique on top of TF IDF and we call something a idea called relevance game.,
