right yeah you basically have to say here's the analytics integration right it's like Google Analytics you just copy this tag in the header or the footer we increment so it will not affect the site performance you do product feed so either you can do a JSON XML or CSV upload here's what the data looks like right basically a sample schema and you upload it and that's it and then to integrate the widget you basically can come in and say okay I can either call an API to get the actual products all the activities and you can decide to show however you want to show it or if you wanted to do it based on the front-end piece then your real quick using template editor so there's a front-end piece where you just copy/paste a div text I can I can just show you what the real life example looks like so let's just take and pick okay so here's the div tag right basically you give us a div tag put an ID to it this might be a better example with me going here real quick and show you that this might be more on the front end okay so this is this is the div tag right you basically give us an empty div tag and we basically populate all the contents in it so that could be a front-end implementation a back-end implementation could be done using the API responses so you can control exactly do you want to show it horizontally or vertically if you want total control you can do it through the API option .,
