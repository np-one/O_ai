this is happening because the way solar parses the data out is is looking at the individual keywords so what it's doing now is for search suggestions it's doing phrase keyword pattern-matching so it's able to show you the steel-toe that you've been seeing consistently but for popular products it's now restarting it by showing a t-shirt because the letter T matched and you can see here as soon as i typing teo it starts to show me some other products including a steel toe so that's another limitation of solar you have to write a ton of code and I'll show you what that looks like ton of code to actually accommodate for what a complete search system would really look like all right you know ahead yes please.,
