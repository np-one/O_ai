Right and and what what we have changed in last few as if a couple of quarters is that we guarantee at least a minimum ten ten percent of uptick in your conversion so we provide you the first sixty ninety days as a POC meaning you will not have a yearly commitment for the first sixty to ninety days of the engagement so within those sixty to ninety days if you don't see increasing the conversion you don't like the solution that we provide then you have no I would say contractual bounding to work with us and then you can walk out of the contract at any given point in time within the sixty ninety days right. So he ensured that the onus is known on our team to start showing you results from the first sixty days of the implementation else we have we are losing the customer right and that's the last thing you would want to do so that's the way we are engaging and that's that's one reason where you see all those big logos out there because it makes it very easier for them to test us out some of the larger organizations even test us out on a smaller scale they come and the first 30 days they'll just use our solution for 10 percent of the traffic and see how the performances and and then slowly grow it 200 percent in the 90 days not risky neatly on onto something new. So that is that that's a new engagement model that that we have today for all our customers trying this out and then that makes it very easy for them to try.,
