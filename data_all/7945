So those are some of the things that we've tried building out and especially in the context of search what we've done is we are giving you metrics on your autofill feature and we also giving you metric on your search feature as well right and in search A you get a high level reporting on your top search queries your zero results clicked products and order  products and you also have a fairly in-depth reporting where you can now go and drill down for every query when it comes to search and for every category or a custom landing page when it comes to category pages where you can see how every specific asset is actually doing for you you can go and drill down and see how every query like say a dress is doing and see all the products associated to this query and the business metrics of that query so if last week this query was converting at 3 point 8 percent and now it's dropped with 3 point 6 percent you immediately know that there were probably a few popular products which went out of stock which is why the performance of this query actually dropped.,
