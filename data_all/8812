I would want to understand more so obviously the auto suggest is not right so if I'm talking about this right there's something this Is not but if you want to make changes yes we can always help you. So say we come in me implement something and then you are not seeing enough good results than you we would want to come in and make those changes for you so you would surely help you with that and any other minor design changes that you are going Through is something that's taken care of as a part of support but if there is a totally redesigning of the site that you're going through in that case that would come at an additional cost but it should be very nominal.,
