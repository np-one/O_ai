but um I also want I'll send over a bit of a specific deck that talks about shelf scanner I think the one thing to kind of go away with on the shelf scanner side is this is an area and I'd even talked to some of the guys at UIC and IRI and so on just in touch with them just extra time few days and that whole AI and like image recognition which I mean there's a ton of money left on shelf as far as out of stock shell availability planogram compliance and especially if you're able to you know save forty percent of time and you're like sales your in-store field audit seems there's a lot of from a revenue management side money that can be saved through these types of these types of tools and they can be saved quite quickly so something to think about and these aren't things that take you four five six months to do there's things that there's things that we can test in four weeks you know max.,
