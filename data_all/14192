that's that's the first piece the second piece I know you mentioned you know price it's currently you know the question is whether you gonna see value from it or not now you know did it just to you know kind of give you a ballpark I mean so so we typically started customers at $1000 per month and you know so that's that's the cost of our solution but if there is any window to make me bring it down by you know a couple of hundred dollars or so you know I'm going to work with my team internally to see if that's possible and and and and try to set you up and at the same time I mean like I said the POC is this is in place for you to see the value and and maybe you know after the POC you decide that it's not really helping the cause and you don't see the value is free to walk away but but .,
