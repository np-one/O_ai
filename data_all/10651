Okay so there are two things we would need one is we will put together all this terms and conditions on our contract paper including the evaluation POC everything and send you the contract. If you can just execute on that contract before you go for your vacation that will be really helpful and in parallel what I'll also do is I'll basically do all the whatever is the integration checklist that we have I'll basically send that to you. Then what we can do is once you're back probably on 25th or 26th of this month or Monday the week after Monday or Tuesday we can set up a one-hour integration call we would ideally want both you and Alex on that call unless you have about if not one hour at least thirty minutes next week where you can just login Alex will be in the office so we can do the integration call next week itself so we just need that initial <>.,
