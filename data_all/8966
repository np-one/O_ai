On top of it two things that we do right the machine learning algorithm actually learns based on two things one is the first thing is on your site right what is people behavior how do they misspell words how do they search for products and then what is it that they click on or they buy right. We understand that behaviour and start I would say putting that into the technology onto our algorithm and analytics over and above that we also I would say crawl the web on a regular basis right and understand how people are searching outside on the web right and then what's their behaviour. And that's where <> some of the trends and festivities come into picture right some of the slang words which have been used on on web and people come and try to search that on your site whether your system is  able to understand that because it has the outside knowledge and the inside knowledge within your system. On top of it what we have built is a multi-word spellcheck right which is able to automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.,
