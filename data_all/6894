right so now what I want to do is go through all those specific use cases on your site and and have gone through all the specific use cases sites starting from the first experience which is your search box like what do people say to them they start typing but trying to find a product on the search box then look at the error tolerance and the site then look at the actual code relevancy it's just probably the most critical thing then have taken some examples on the UI you could probably look at doing differently and then we can talk about much in it so this is essentially what we wanted to discuss with you on the call and.,
