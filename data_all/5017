so that was stage two  and in stage 3 where people basically are looking at product comparison some what's what they really liked that there was a lot of review sites I personally went through every product review the PDP page is extremely detailed you have a lot of information about the products you have a lot of these reviews and you also have some of these similar products that you that you also have which is a nice to have features what could be good to have is typically product recommendation and complementary products on the page that that could also help and what we've done is since we work with a lot of small and medium businesses we typically have built and templatized a lot of these recommendation widgets that you can add is typically everything that yeah that is available on amazon dot com every kind of widget that you would see is typically something of yours templatized it's available as a widget so it's very easy to integrate thing is right so as something and then in the checkout stage people were really happy to see the cross sell recommendation we we suggest that as a best practice so it was good to have and when you get to the return stage which was interesting or issue 25 users we told them to go back to the site 24 hours later eight of them actually went back to check like 30% of them went back to see the same products only two users could recall the products that used and others founded this is the spotters so one thing that we've done is when we get to know through a cookie that it's a returning user while he's searching for something similar if he was looking for waterproof shoes the previous day and if he comes back and starts typing waterproof shoes we show him a recently viewed widget so that he can quickly go back to the same product because as we remember as you remember that we basically had done this survey and we found this 73% users come with an intent to buy we basically want to make make sure that we capture the attention right then.,
