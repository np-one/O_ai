Which which you know provide the ease of processing data at scale right. and Which provides you know organizations You know it better insights about customers and you know so that they can reach to the customers in a more personalized manner right so we'd all these things It does become like a for the organization that are in scale you know it does become very difficult for them to adapt  quickly and you know change alright otherwise catching up with the speed has been very difficult that is there you know we as an organization You know we come into play We help our customers You know in there overall transformational journey.,
