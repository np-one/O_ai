Sure no I took the call you know I didn't reach out to y'all go reached out to me and I took the call because I know that I don't spend a lot of time thinking about our site search. And I know that it gets used and like you said we don't have a lot of products and a lot of our product are similar so really I took the call just to see if what you guys are doing are interesting to me. And if you know if there really is no opportunity for us you know spinning done time and effort toward our site search.,
