so here you're showing different sets of products on mobile you're showing different sets of products now the question is if your conversion on mobile is much lower possibly your average order value is also much lower and on your desktop maybe conversion is higher and your average order value is also much higher so in that instance if you are showing not the right kind of products based on what that variance in buying behavior is from mobile to desktop you are going to lose those customers on mobile and maybe in mobile you are doing that to say look you have a button blouse and I don't know why address is showing up as a blouse but but I think that you know and maybe that's what the challenge is you want to be able to show different set of products for because the buying behaviour on mobile and desktop is different and I'll tell you what where you might also see a different buying behaviour your channels when you do I'm sure you do run a lot of marketing campaigns you to email PPC social media organic SEO etc.,
