And then the second thing is and-ing which is Nike and black and field and boots or minimum match when they would go and do Nike and black or Nike and field or boots right so a mix and match of and-ing and or-ing right. But with us we have built a system which is able to understand the intent of the customer how we do it is breaking those those search queries into different pieces and trying to understand what is the product type right. What is the colour type say Nike is the brand type now black is the colour and field boots are more the product type right so we understand the intent that that customer is actually looking for a field boot which is black in color and from a brand Nike right and we start showing the results accordingly. Not just that on top of it what also comes in is popularity which comes through machine right meaning say then you you have 20 different black boots but which is the one that you want to so on top and why right and and that's that comes from machine learning.,
