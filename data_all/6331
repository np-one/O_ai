and that's how I want you to think about it to say this makes sense but how do we structure this where you're already spending so much money for top of the funnel but when they come to the middle of the funnel we're not optimising it for them so where do we get the funding from and it doesn't have to be ten thousand I'm just making those numbers up maybe it's only five thousand for you guys and but the ROI should at least be 10 20 X in terms of you invest a dollar you should get 10 to 20 dollars back from that investment .,
