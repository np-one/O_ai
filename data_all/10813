got it so that instance if that's the path you take then your team doesn't have to spend enough time the only thing you guys have to do is give us a page on the back end where you put the header you put the footer and the middle portion of the search results will render those results.  and so that means the owners will be more on the Unbxd side to actually come up with the design come up with the results and try to figure out everything that needs to be figured out in order to make that page work.  and all your team has to do is say here's a page will render the header footer and gives you guys an empty div tag deploy our JavaScript and that's it everything else will be taken care of by us so which is better than the restful API approach where your team has to call the API consume the response and sort of connect that with the application to actually render the results.,
