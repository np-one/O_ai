Right and I don't know how much do you get into be for the techniques of stuff but what happens is just to give you a side context. Let's say I'm searching for a women's by jean and the numbers in the red are the tf-idf score now when I'm searching for genes why is a white top coming up because sometimes it would say that this this white top goes great with gene just because the keywords exist doesn't mean it's a relevant product and that's why the idea score will be higher than other jean so what we come in and apply is a layer called relevant game which then gives you the ability ability to say when I look at white jeans women and IDF women will be the highest score then white and then gene but after the relevance game will know that jean is higher than women and then white. And so now what happens is we push more jean up top push that white top towards the bottom. However white top is still in the result set so now we apply an elimination technique this is where because of the word catalog and the ability to understand what a product is and what a product attribute is we know that white top is the top and not a jean the customers looking for jean be going and exclude the white top and we push more jean up top . Then comes in the user behaviors this is a machine learning piece that we were talking about where we come in and start looking at the clickstream data to see what is the best performing product and then we start make sure show that product up top automatically.,
