the next piece is let me show you some first off second okay so here's a PowerPoint so next is the relevancy so we've actually solved 12 different types of queries that customer search with now not all 12 will be applicable to you but any there are applicable will automatically be solved based on the relevancy of the query next is spellcheck of customer misspelled Zanda queries will show the corrected spelling of that keyword second will show multiple options if there are probable options more than one and third we automatically will start showing results for the most probable answer if customers over time start clicking on option two or option three that will automatically become option one over time next is stemming if customers looking for shoe versus shoes etc we automatically send those keywords so you don't have to do that manually it automatically takes care of those elements automated redirect if the customer is searching for something that matches exactly to your taxonomy he automatically redirects when you don't have to manually do that,
