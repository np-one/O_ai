Ridhima didn't mind is repeating please.
that's fine. so yeah I was just saying that the whole maintenance of code on Shopify for a side becomes a lot easier because as in how you add a new site you're also going to be adding in a lot of third-party plugins the whole implementation is a lot of you know easier to do within Shopify because of this whole templating thing that I was talking about where you know you can take a specific template live and then you want any of your other third body guys to work on some specific implementations and that can be done in different templates and it's very easy to switch from one to the other you know if something is not working you know you can just go back to the other snapshot you had of your site without really having to worry about getting in the third party guys to fix it for you and so on in big commerce all of this requires a lot of specific changes and you know the ability of getting test sites to try out your implementation your staging environments all of that is a lot different from the way Shopify handles it so Shopify makes it a lot easier for you to you know handle the infra the admin piece as well as making sure that all the technical pieces can be handled a lot more seamlessly and more smoothly than how it is on the BigCommerce.,
