No so you don't have to enter the possibility so it's out-of-the-box meaning you know so let's say you know for instance your site somebody looking for a specific colour let's say sky-blue colour now that's you know sky-blue or let's say it's a fire for instance and somebody types in green for instance so there are multiple ways of saying the same colour but you know so what what we're able to do is we were able to understand the context that in on yours on your site let's say you know green would mean you know I'm forgetting words here but but you you know so let's say emerald or sapphire and let's say somebody had to type in the actual colour name we're able to identify it out of the box and ensure relevant results so that's another piece of the technology as well.,
