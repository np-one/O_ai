then I misspelled micro controller more than misspelled I actually introduced the white space to be micro and controller it did not take me to the right results page so these were small little things that I found on the site and I understand with five million parts it could be a challenge managing with the solar infrastructure because if you have to manually go and correct everything for five million parts it is a completely non scalable solution one of the things that we have tried doing is essentially try and have resolved this in an algorithmic way where actually built in algorithms which could auto correct up to three words misspelled in a single search phrase and all these stemmed words that you would see single approving words introducing white spaces in between are all auto corrected so that you don't have to actually have a site ops team which constantly keeps looking at zero results and actually keep updating that money list or synonym because we understand that can be extremely time-consuming it's not productive and we have tried solving this and in a algorithmic way right.,
