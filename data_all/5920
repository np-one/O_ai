so well I don't know if you're familiar with Avon business at all but most of the sales are not coming through it's only 5% are coming for Avon dot com most sales are coming through reps that have a customer base so I would say it's a growing priority knowing that we need to be attracting customers shopping online but to date it hasn't been a huge priority or focus if you can believe it it was actually worse than this before and we've brought in a search agency to help improve the performance but clearly there's still more work to be done.,
