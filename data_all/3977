But what we do as a system is something like this so when even if you misspell words on our system like here I have misspelled black leather and jacket. I've misspelled all the three words incorrectly but what the system sees is jacket is actually a product leather is actually a fabric attribute and black is the colour attribute. It will understand what this actually means resolve it by asking you a question that did you mean black leather jacket and then instantly start showing you all the products as well. So this way the relevancy even if you have misspelled something is extremely correct right we not only auto correct a single word but we auto correct up to six words in a single long search phrase.,
