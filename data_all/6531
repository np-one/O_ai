right away my point is like that's a great example right is where we'll say oh I'm long an inventory crap I'm gonna go like promote this product to the top which is exactly the right short-term thinking and wrong long-term thinking if you're probably here you're either long an inventory because people don't like the product so now you're putting the concept people don't like right up in front of them or you're long an inventory because you had a buy site problem which has nothing to do with the consumer so in that sense I like I want some algorithm and the machine learning to say I understand and I'm long an inventory here but I'm not going to sacrifice conversion rate just to move your inventory because we're actually better of as a business if we're driving consumer acquisition and transnational frequency more so than we are for the cost of that inventory that's sitting there and so loss to deploy other marketing tactics around it and I was that that's the thing is I think I grew with you there's these weird businesses especially in fashion apparel where like we let the tail wag the dog the purity of machine learning should get us to the point where with the light business we'll set up one level higher that it's continually trying to like maintain that and push that through where I feel like I mean I like a lot of the things that you guys are doing but I'm trying to push it one step further and say it's not about pinning that product at the top just because it came from Facebook it's about pinning that products with us because that's what that consumer actually wanted to see and then the system knows that you're responding to an ad on Facebook that might have had that sweater but everyone who clicked that ad actually buying a different sweater so let's promote that one .,
