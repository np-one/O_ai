and it's not that you know by the way from a semantic irrelevance perspective it's not we're coming and saying oh you've got everything not nailed down 100% there is no such thing as hundred percent but what we've come up with the ability to is to actually tune the system in such a way and actually figure that out for you and it gets better over time maybe not the perfect way it's day one maybe it's 70% day one and it gets better over time so that's that's the essence of this and that's not the only thing that we do by the way so that's first step one of four step two is to try to understand the meaning of each word and this is where we've built this by scanning on 100000 ecommerce site indexing almost 200 200 million products in our system to create an algorithm that actually understands when I search for say women's white jeans that jeans is the product white is the color attribute and women's is the gender attribute and so now what happens is which is another big problem is that when you get search results you may try to solve the relevancy up to a certain extent but you always have loosely relevant products in the catalog or in the results that also like for example let's say this white top shows up the white top also shows up because it might have somewhere in the description where it says this goes great with jeans so it still has women's white and jeans words in it in the title description etc and so it's still loosely relevant so now what happens is we actually identify the type of product this is and I understand that in your world everything is books but even within books you probably know that there is categorization and subcategories ation as to how products can be differentiated the question comes in now is if I understand that jeans is the product and I know in the results said I have tops as products also the tops are not the same as jeans so that's the second thing that we do we now actually exclude loosely relevant products because they are not the actual product and we show more relevant products up top then the third thing is we also do user behavior search where we're actually tracking clickstream data where we track all the clicks that a customer does whether they are searching or not searching so product click searches click through Add to Cart buys filters pagination sorting every single click gets track and using that data in the context of that query again we try to figure out what is your star product okay so women's white jeans may have this product as the star product white jeans may have this product as a star product so it may have different sets of products that are different for different queries and so then you reorder the products based on popularity based on that clicks from data and then the last piece that we do is what we call merchandising which is again something that depending on your lasting search you may have experienced that maybe not maybe switch to solar you'll experience that where if you want to merchandise products and reorder them based on whatever business rules there might be there's no consistent way to do merchandising you always have to use some random number of points but here I want to boost this shoe up top have i boosted by 10 points which may not be enough so I boosted by 20 points for a different query the range might be 1 to 100 so certainly now I have two boosted by hundred and twenty points and sometimes some of these products get boosted so much that they start to show up all over the place even though they were not intended to show up in that instance and so that's what another problem that we solved by normalizing this process so all merchants basically use percentages to boost to boost the products so that's the technology aspect of it here's some of these to give you a very quick overview of what the limitations of elasticsearch or solar are so you can get what's the middle box from solar or elasticsearch but you need all the other blue boxes to make it a really good search system including real time merchandising so you'll have to build dashboards to actually have merchants and marketing team to be able to do a lot of things so they don't bother IT all the time next is a lot of context awareness so you get the relevancy controls the synonym corpuses stemming spellcheck etc autocomplete from a UI perspective to help guide the customer and I'll show you some examples of what we do next is self learning algorithms the user behavior stuff that we talked about and the infrastructure to scale so I'm pretty sure that you have a huge expense in terms of the infrastructure just to host three million Proactiv products and typically if you grow that's going to grow so that's just from a pure cost perspective that's also something years to manage but then how do you do analysis if you wanted to start changing and making changes to search from a user behavior based then you need even more infrastructure to be able to do that and you need a lot of manual work to scale .,
