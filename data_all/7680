Yep I think we need some more because I also need to remove seasonality out of the equation because the site launched February 2016 but we weren't live within Google until May so it kind of in my eyes were not quite at our one-year mark and I want to be able to look at what sold by to see if there's any seasonality to it as well. So I mean all of these tools are great I think for a more mature more a site that's got more data and more issues I really don't have anything any problems I want to solve because we're still very much in the learning phase of understanding how she's shopping what types of products she's buying and still trying to understand her behavior.,
