And the reason we we are able to this is to write machine learning within the site machine learning on the web right first we do a lot of machine learning on the web and on a day to day basis we crawl the web to understand the kind of synonymous words out there the root words are stemmed words colors if you if you sell a lot of color variances we're also able to understand the color variances red versus a crimson versus garnet versus Ruby right you understand that all of them belong to the red color family so that is that is a knowledge that we get from the web. Now the second is within the site what what is it that people click on when they when they use certain words what is it that they start looking at on the site and they and the algorithms are able to understand them automatically right that that's the that's where the machine learning comes into picture in terms of understanding user behavior on a particular website and start incorporating that for future uses right every time we see say five clicks made in a particular pattern by users on the site the algorithm will products for right set of results. Then what I looked at was the existing site search these page load speeds right so the responses seemed to be much lower than the industry standard the industry standard is somewhere around lesser than 300 milliseconds because Google says anything less than 300 300 milliseconds is usually not observed by human eye. On your site across all the four regions in the country the response time was between 900 to 1000 milliseconds which is 300 to 350 percent slower then what in an ideal case it should be. Here is an example or a snapshot that we were able to pull up from Express on a Black Friday one of the most busiest day in the year on the site and you'll see across four regions if you were able to deliver searches within the sub 300 milliseconds response time.,
