Okay so here I searched for mobile now the challenge here is very similar to the indicator one right if I Search for mobile I have cell phones smart phones mobile headphones cases covers bluetooth Etc I don't know what mobile category are usually referring to so the one way we realized was there's two types of customers one who needs that help to guide them and narrow them down the other customer which may be very rare in your case because it's more B2B is coming in and just browsing and don't have an intent to buy this just want to come in and check it out maybe they want to know what costs there is their price shopping whatever the case might be and they don't necessarily want to get forced down as particular path so what we did was at the top here the Unbxd technology figures out automatically when I search for mobile we figure out what are the categories that are related to mobile and second we also look at the clickstream data the analytics data and we can deploy our own tags to do that to figure out which order we should put them in so we know that most people who search for mobile come in and search for smartphones and then screen protectors is the last one and so we will order them in that order let's say over time screen protectors become more popular that will start to percolate up top and re-change the order in that sense. But we still always show products for that best category that we believe customers are mostly going to come in and see because that customer who wants to be guided will click here the one who doesn't care about being guided just wants to come in and browse is going to want to start seeing products. And that's the balance that we've that we have found is very important to structure that way and I think what we were also going to see so here two components to this let's say neon indicators one could be a category because you clearly have a category called neon indicators but I might also have come in and just typed in indicators so if I type in indicators maybe I want to show you the incandescents or the indicator lenses or the neon indicators and maybe you know the struggle the industrial indicators etcetera the toolkits and stuff and we can show that of CHOP to guide them and say well which indicator are you talking about but when they do search for neon indicators one ways for you to do the redirect clearly but that's not a scalable solution because I might just come in and say a type of neon indicator and suddenly we can redirect one word and you were back to that same segment of how do we actually solve that query and so what we feel is that if a customer searches for neon indicators the technology will figure out that the customer is looking for either that category because we have the access to the taxonomy and the category data or even if they had a feature around the neon indicator for them to come in and say let's say 125 volts neon indicator if that's what it is but it's a green neon indicator we will automatically know to show them the relevant results because we have built a semantic search engine that figures that process house it understands that you're looking for an indicator which might be on neon in terms of a category and in his green in color I'll give you a simple example brown leather jacket we know that jacket is a product leather is the fabric attribute and Brown is the color attribute the way we've been able to build this out is we've scanned almost a hundred thousand e-commerce sites index almost two hundred and fifty million products and ran an algorithm a machine learning algorithm that figured out how to parse a product type versus a product attribute versus a category into from a limitation perspective.,
