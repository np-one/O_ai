This is again something which is based on machine Learning right so the the technology is able to find similar products based on the product catalog attributes right and the customers intent also right so it is is it is he on this page because he's more bent towards the color towards the the style or to towards the say designer based on that the technology will be able to understand and start showing similar products. But to ant two elements to it one is the product catalog which will give all the product catalog of the existing product and the other products that you carry and be the user behavior in terms of what the user has been looking at on the site. Because say someone looking at $30 product you don't want to show him $100 product right so that is also taken into consideration with regards to say pricing even if it is similar there are other for sandals and shoes which are in that price which show ones in the same price range first rather than showing something which is either too expensive or very low priced.,
