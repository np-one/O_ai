And then you get into the whole merchandising components you get the ability to do boosting and you can boost by any attribute that you send us in the catalogue margins titles attributes availability etc inventory doesn't matter how you want to boost your own products price for example. You can also do slotting and <> so slotting is a concept where you might come in and say you know what my best category page is outdoor furniture and let me just open that up real quick so let's say I have outdoor furniture seating let's outdoor seating is your one of the most new categories. So now between the first fold you want to make sure and show maybe two bestsellers maybe one product that is high in inventory maybe to new arrivals and maybe one which has very high margin or something unique that you want to you want to showcase. And you are able to now define those so now let's say you defined and said let two bestsellers the algorithm will figure that out now for this particular blog I want to show high inventory product. Now let's say the rule is show me a product that is in inventory higher than 50% for example as soon as that inventory goes below 50% the system will automatically find another product within this category that has higher than 50% inventory and start to show that here. If let's say you have some high margin products in position five four and five and those products go out of inventory the next two products which have higher margin will start to show up automatically.,
