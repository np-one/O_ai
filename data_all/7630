I really agree and I think it's it's the customers that I've seen here are different their their behavior is different than customers I've seen on other sites and other places I've worked and I think it's because we have new collections that come out every month I have new assortments that come out every month and she wants to see the new stuff it's not like she knows she's looking for a red dress so she's gonna come on she's gonna search for a red dress she's gonna only look at the red dresses buy it and move on. She shops she browses other she goes through our categories she looks at our new stuff she's a window shopper I mean my conversions great don't get me wrong but she she's a window shopper she wants to scroll through and see what the assortment is as supposed to just searching buying leaving.,
