that is one thing that we don't think yeah we don't recommend the third one we actually recommend that which is what a lot of people do is the API approach which is like a one diffusely mystery where we essentially have a plugin that is built for Magento and we do a simple API integration right we don't recommend that early on because an API integration will require dev cycles on your site so we don't want you to do an API without being absolutely sure we recommend using the Ajax go live with it do the POC after three months once you've seen the results of yourself then you can invest your developers time on actually doing an API integration .,
