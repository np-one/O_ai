that's a great question Braden so let me show you what why is that the case when you look at personalization and we talk about personalization in two different contexts number one is one-to-one personalization so if I want to make sure that I show you the product specifically for you I need some amount of historical data that is statistically relevant some amount of digital trail that you have left behind maybe you're logged in maybe you have bought it from the forest from us bought from us in the past and we have you still have that cookie so we know enough about you to be able to do one-to-one personalization now in the best case scenario there's one-to-one personalization can be applicable to 20% of your customer traffic that comes to the site by the way Amazon best of the breed can only do up to 25% of the traffic that comes to their site a one-to-one personalization so we believe it rough estimates a 20% the next 20% where we don't have enough data of people you have some data they have looked at a couple of products they have used some filters and we know some implicit data about them the personalization algorithm will take care of trying to show them better related products based on what we know about them and sometimes there's Auto context data let's say I bought jeans of a particular type but for t-shirts you know I might have bought cheaper jeans but I want more expensive t-shirt right so we can't just always use that data from one category context and move it on to the other so this is where we start looking at some implicit data like the like where the customer is coming from there's collaborative data with what did other customers who had very similar behaviour what is they do and start your personalized this is your second 20% of your customers that you can do so total 43 percent of your customer base you can do some level of personalization 20 percent one to one another 20% a little bit on the collaborative filtering aspect so roughly 40% can be addressed as first line,
