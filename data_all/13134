got it perfect so the typical process would be as following we had obviously shared with you the pricing for both products combined into one yeah and and you I'm assuming you also want to make sure you test this so depending on how you want to go about testing this the approach could be multiple ways so one is you agree on the pricing we sign a contract there's a clause that gives you the ability to walk out of that clause within 90 day notice so if you are tested for 90 days you don't like it you have the option to walk away.,
