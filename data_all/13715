well I think to remember you know some of the conversation centred around when we were shocked or no we initially started talking about search and you know we kind of left with the impression that we're not we're not necessarily looking for a new search partner right now but there was something more that your company offered and I do remember there being a some sort of site review or something that was that was promised but I don't remember the specifics on what else we talked about outside of search but I know that we it did come up that right now we're not really looking for a search partner I think you've shown us some interesting results of you know why we might need to reconsider that but is there more to what you offer other than you know the site search.,
