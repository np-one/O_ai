Okay cool so this is something so as far as we have this typically works with Color variances if you have different images for a particular product right indexed well we can we Unbxd has the ability to show the right products so in this case if you're looking for a red dress and if there is an image for the red dress only the the we will go ahead and show the red image and not the white or the black image of the same same dress right. Color synonyms what we have done is built up built a huge corpus of the color synonyms meaning if I was to come and look on your website for a red t-shirt if if you have a red t-shirt that's the first thing that we will show if you do not have a red t-shirt right what and and if you call it as a crimson t-shirt or a chary shirt Unbxd because of the Unbxd color synonym corpus we have the ability to identify that you're looking for products from the red color family and we would end up showing the red color products on top then showing the black or the white . Zero result page so today a lot of websites do not show any products for any <> of junk or you know junk queries typed in there and we all know that we will end up having a zero results page.,
