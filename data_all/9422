Adobe for that as well got it and so what we wanted to introduce from that perspective is a concept of campaigns right. So when you are talking about looking at it from a from a customer perspective or from a campaign perspective you can define a campaign for either category page or a query you can define start date time end date time and then what we believe is something very unique to Unbxd. Where you can start in getting enter segments so there's two components there's a lot of conversation about personalization and one-to-one personalization now when you look at the true data of one-to-one personalization. No matter how much you try to figure that out the number of customers that's going to impact at a max it is going to be about 15 percent you cannot personalize 100% of the customers experience one-to-one personalized 100% of the customers experience. You can only do that for up to 50 percent of the customers for that remaining 50 to 60 percent your bottom 30 percent are never gonna buy from you we all know that but that's true for any e-commerce site. But then middle 50% there's an opportunity to move the needle but we don't know enough about them to actually do a one-to-one personalization so we believe the concept of segmenting and targeting becomes extremely important.,
