correct yes a couple of two to three weeks worth of development depending on amount of back end force that we need to do sometimes you're more back and forth then it takes a little bit longer but one or two weeks of testing and I'm sure there's going to be some sort of a deployment processes that you guys follow whatever that takes a week to deploy or not so that's like about four to six weeks so that's all.,
