but it is responsive yes short answer okay here's last example this is a grocery customer again in grocery if you look at your last grocery run you bought almost 1215 lots of products in a single transaction right so that's the same behavior online as well but the problem this customer was facing was it was taking almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these 15 products so we redesigned their autocomplete and search experience to look like this where we actually show products that they've bought in the past in the left insect section under the assumption and the behavior we saw that you typically buy the same products that you normally buy a grocery right every week every other week it's the same products that you buy so with that said you can easily see that if I buy a chicken without skin I'll see that up top if you buy chicken boneless breast you'll see that up top right and for products that you normally don't buy you also see some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories and again you can see for products normally by you can quickly change the quantity and Add to Cart from right here so this way we were able to bring down the 45 clicks down to 18 to 20 clicks to buy the same 15 products.,
