When they're trying to search on the website so I tried a couple of permutation combinations and tried goalkeeper gloves by missing out an e which displayed no products same thing that I saw you had some product called Nike Pro Tiger black and then I try to do that by removing I think one of the Gs and it did not give me any results then I try to interchange E and K in Nike I know it's stupid but the whole idea was to see if actually we get any you know if it automatically corrects the query understands the query and shows the right products it this where did return some products but the very first product the red t-shirt that you see there is actually from Adidas not Nike and this were these results were surely shown are under any random logic is what I assumed. Then important so this is auto suggest and and the error tolerance. Then the most important thing is the search relevance how relevant are the search results for any query on you on your site and I know that you carry a lot of t-shirts and I'm sure that a lot of your revenue must be contributed from from t-shirts and the shoe sales so I try to keep my queries around that and see how they work tried tees the very first product was a shoe second one I tried Adidas tees before then I got four shoes and no t-shirts at all tried Nike football so I saw that you so I I do have a small screen shot here on the right-hand side of the screen well footballs and it was really surprising for me to see so many brands of footballs right. And I try to do Nike footballs I got the shoes then I look for Puma red shoes it gave me no results though I know that not just this Puma red shoes but you have quite a few more Puma red shoes out there I had never heard about black socks tape and I'm not one of those athlete kind of people I didn't know that you could have tapes for socks and when I saw that I I tried to search that using a search bar what I got was black socks and no tape then yeah this this was a nice section you have I think five players listed out there and products,
