alright so as next steps unfortunately I think she was not able to find a reliable Wi-Fi to join the call can we schedule a call I can I apologize to do this although I in 15 minutes you might have to do another call anyways so what I wanted to request is do you have any availability to tomorrow early morning afternoon preferably that works for you you can schedule a call 30 to 40 minutes typically is what it takes and she will run you through all the minutiae details that she needs to know and you can help her guy a little bit business your end obviously to figure out how to design the solution and she'll figure that out start the implementation and then you can see what the timelines are you can see what you can expect from us we will tell you what we expect from you all of that stuff that a fair request .,
