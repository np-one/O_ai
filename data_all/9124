Yep no that's that makes sense I'll show you how easy it is Gary to do something Like that and I don't know whether you saw that when you were here let me just try to quickly refresh this page okay let's say and unfortunately on this demo account I have a apparel catalog so I'll just show you in that context but let's say I want to create a new campaign I want to say a test and I want to start today at the end tomorrow and you can define different sorts of stuff on different devices and the other segments by the way. So Gary from your perspective that's an important distinction if you're making this unique item what is the consumption of these unique items in desktop versus mobile because if you are doing your curbside pickup or your regular business as well our customers are typically looking at it in the mobile and immobile you want to make sure that you know some of the products that you want them to discover our within the first five or ten products right the customers don't like to scroll that much on those sorry . So you can you have that kind of that level of control as to what you want to show and this by the way applies both to search and to the category pages not just search and then I can either start merchandising because I actually have some results when I search for a dress or as a category dress or I can create a custom landing page. So here let's say I start merchandising and let's I want to slot so slotting is the technique that we're talking about so let's say in position three and four I want a particular type of product I'm just going to say title contains let me see what's available here ah Ralph Laurel. So in instantly on the preview right here on the right hand side you'll see that position three and four is showing your floral products so now you can come in and say for a category called that's a dinner item help me out here Gary what kind of unique products do you guys create some category .,
