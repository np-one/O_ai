Yeah absolutely that's fantastic so just to give you a background on who we are we are a product discovery company what we mean by that is that we help ecommerce retailers manage their product discovery on the website. If you think about product discovery from an e-commerce perspective a customer can only discover products on the site in three different ways either through the taxonomy of navigation so if I were to let's say either through your taxonomy and navigation either I use the search box or through product recommendations right. And so Unbxd has built a product and a solution for each one for all three of them and we started out seven years ago we started out with site search four years ago we started into product recommendations and two years ago we started to get into the whole navigation and category pages solution as well. And I'll show you different elements of what our philosophy and how we think about it and what is it that we're really trying to solve and where the opportunity might be. Okay here's some of our customers we work with almost 1200 site web sites globally are roughly hundred twenty customers and brands right here in the US and we manage tremendous amounts of scale in in where we serve almost hundred and 1 point 5 billion interactions per month.,
