so I can show you exactly how it would look like so a hosted page would be something like this so you go to rods dot comm and if I search for say jeans then you can see in the domain it goes to search dot rods dot com right.  now if all the pages look exactly the same then we can pretty much have this one page that's hosted which would be search dot petals dot com or something like that unless you wanna maintain that name domain so that's one.  the second option where you maintain the domain so let's see if I search for a Nike here it goes through this page and you can see how it renders the header first and then a fraction of a second and then it renders the rest of the page so this is where your team can give us this one page call it search results.  you do the header and then you do an empty div tag and I'll show you what that looks like it's a very simple piece that they add there is the one so you can see a div ID wrapper.  and that's you give us an empty div tag and starting with that h1 and all the way to the bottom this whole thing may render that we populated with the HTML that would look and feel exactly how you want to look and feel and which will obviously be the same for all 2000 sites.,
