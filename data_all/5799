so here on the home page you can see we have hand-picked just for you so this is where the customer has actually seen specific products and we are showing them some sets of products based on three behaviours one is the user behaviour second is the product behaviour third is the collaborative behaviour so user behaviour is what type of products did this customer look at are the price sensitive are they category sensitive like do they like museums more than destinations like you know Leaning Tower of Pisa etc and what is that activity that they're more bent towards and maybe their city specific right so those types of behaviors can be made specific next is product behaviour so this is where where is the customer coming from let's say we have some implicit information where the customer is coming from we know that maybe they are coming from Milan and should we show Milan specific activities and what other customers are viewing or trying to do and buying on the side that is more on the collaborative side of things your product behaviour would be what are your best seller best selling activities are in general right is it museum and the museum hopping is it is it destination is it locations etc so that's the idea behind handpick just for you the most complicated algorithm that we put out to make it personalized very one-to-one personalization there and this is in real time by the way if the customer changes their tastes location anything like that this will automatically start to make recommendations based on that as well.,
