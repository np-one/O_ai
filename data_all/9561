As <solar> we also get a lot of irrelevant results sometimes they start doing and-ing then they will say Brown and leather and jacket so if you have all three words they will show the product. If you do not have all three words they will not show any product right they will not show a black leather jacket when you do not have a brown leather jacket now this again limits the number of set up a number of products on the site and not the best way to do search.

So we break this into in a in a way that the system is now able to understand that Nike is a brand black is a colour attribute and field boots is the product type right.,
