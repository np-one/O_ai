card and we have realized that biggest challenge they're also facing is you know there are a lot of regulated state there's a lot of unregulated states how to get the actually getting the right point of sale data and kind of people to use that point of safe data now main point of sales indicated how do you get it right somewhere you get it directly from state which is regulated its very accurate compared to the state that are not regulated you just kind of it means anytime you kind of put some conference factor knowing your history and so on and so forth so how do we take that and kind of build out the complete end-to-end analytics for them right in terms of trying to show them how they're doing per state what is the profitability by product what is the price sensitivity price elasticity so in a lot of and this is not something as I said you know John its not that our customers are kept doing this for the first time and I think it's not that brillio is doing it for the first time for them right I mean we think coming into play where they're seeing value is uptake on the accuracy and uptake on their ability to start using it more and kind of integrating it more in their ecosystem right.,
