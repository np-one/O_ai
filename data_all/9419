Well thank you I know I'm going over the time a little bit here but I have two more things I will quickly show you and just just save on time I'll show you a just make sure so this is the backend dashboard that currently we have today that you get access to in terms of merchandising. And you would have capability to do a lot of things using the backend dashboard now as you can see I've just opened up all the different screens to just give you an idea of what's possible and what's not but you know you at a high level you get an executive summary. How many queries product use add to cart events products are sold you get your revenue revenue total revenue to revenue by search visit revenue by search query. So this gives you a really good idea of how your search is doing and where you're heading from a trend perspective are you going down are you going up etc next you also get the ability to look at merchandising. And I'll quickly show you a video it's just for sake of time and how how that merchandising would work so here from a merchandising perspective and and this is something where I want to introduce the whole category pages concept also.,
