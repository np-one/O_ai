okay a quick snapshot on our product seat itself as I told you we do end-to-end product discovery site search was a cool product that's the product we started our company with but we also now built out products for covering all your category pages we ha we have product recommendation product essentially we use a widget strategy there so every single widget will probably see on Amazon today right from you also you bought also bought upsell cross-sell by the loop complete the set they built all these widgets all you have to do with a simple JavaScript install it machine learning picks it up and starts throwing up the most recommended products and off late that was in q4 last year we also introduced a segment and target product very similar to Adobe segment and target but the strength of this product is essentially if you are already using our site search and category navigation and personalization products these are already a lot of learning so we can essentially segment and toggle from day one and I'll take you to us to what we do when it comes to segment and target in this work so this is essentially the whole gamut of product discovery a over it just as in a fire.,
