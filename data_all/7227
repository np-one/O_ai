No I think I mean for us you know big challenges we we have other issues on our site for example we have to sell our product at MSRP and everywhere else is discounting our product and so you know people are just more savvy shoppers and they realize that they can get it for much cheaper on Amazon for example so while we're able to drive traffic to our site they're not converting so I think you know while search might be a factor for us you know we we also have other issues that we need to fix.,
