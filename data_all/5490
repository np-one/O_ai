relevancy definitely seems to be an issue here again so they they search for climb snow boots and obviously maybe for snow boots showed up but you have tons of plans as I look at through to the site two users who choose to find the products or services those they found that they had to reselect the brands and the product category to reach the desired product so I think it seems like the context aspect who wasn't really clear even though the brand was clearly stated in the search results in we're having great if I was the split this was all in the first sentence without having to filter by the way that keeps the purpose of that whole search box okay and this is what they had to do is put a little dose down there okay medium specificity I don't know if that a common the ferns Lauren in terms of research experience on the site or not but that is at least what we found on the site second was medium specificity with navigation for the task of looking for GPS in it storm one of the other 25 including one who switched from source search use navigation to look for the product under three thousand navigator to Accessories category and selected the navigation in that and we're able to find this product for search however again the same problem,
