and so so I feel pretty confident and which is why I said rightly put warehouses and the idea behind that is every POC that we've done we've been able to grow at least 15-20 percent if not 30 percent in some instances so we know we are going to go after the full monty of the four thousand that we want to earn but we also want to make sure that we prove this to you and we align ourselves if you don't do it you don't get it if you prove it we get it and so be prepared that it's not gonna be two thousand or twelve hundred we're gonna do everything in our power to earn the four thousand all we are asking is just give us an opportunity the only other case I wanted to also throw this out there because you're going to the media I won't keep you too long either is just there's a small fee for the POC we used to do three pieces by the way long time ago but we learned the lesson the hard way a lot of times you might have multiple projects that you do and if you has a free one we will never get the time of the day or the priority so we do ask for small fee there's a setup fee and end the use of 60 days or 90 days of whatever time frame that you use we would combine bundle everything into one fee which would come around something say five thousand to six seven thousand dollars one time depending on again of what customisation you asked us to do if there's nothing we wouldn't be close to the 5k if it is a lot of customisation it may be seven or more depending on what that is and and that's it. so there's a set up fee one time which also covers the POC timeframe if you continue to if you perform you pay us be the 4k number if you don't perform pay us the 1200 or the 2k or whatever that in between numbers out to fee.,
