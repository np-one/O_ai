No I get the search piece but recommendations don't make sense for us if a customer is buying dresses for me to recommend other dresses I can use what comes with the site because I can see the category if she's buying suits. Same thing I can see the category from our separates so we have jackets tops pants and skirts I would prefer to complete the look but I don't have enough of a product assortment to give her a relevant experience for completing the look and I don't have shoes accessories or handbags so from where we are with what we have the assortment it doesn't make sense to integrate with a recommendation dungeon.,
