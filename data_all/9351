You can see these suggestions that are being provided one is accent I don't know what that means so now as a customer I have to choose between to say chair or chairs and here we're in the trouble is is the customer going to look at it and say well should I pick chair or chairs. Am I gonna get one chair or I'm gonna get accent chairs am I gonna get one table or tables let's say if it was not accident it was bar accessories you can see bar accessories or accessory. And this is a big challenge to begin with because what a type ahead should do is make it easy for the customer to choose where they really want to go if they already had a specific product in mind make suggestions to those products so they don't have to type the whole thing out. And because you have so many different categories and subcategories think about me walking into a physical store at kirklands physical store now I know the footprints of some of the kirklands stores are small. But if you do still have a lot of these categories and I had a specific idea in mind the first thing I want to do is go to that aisle or that section where those types of products are being sold or are on display. So how do we expose to them categories how do we expose to them exactly even subcategories depending on what they're searching for provide some keyword suggestions to what we might be looking for.,
