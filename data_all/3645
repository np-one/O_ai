say that you know I'm on the spawn channel and let me try ringing in this number from an alternate help desk system so you once you have the phone of course you also have the option to make outbound calls from your system Is this and now let's say I'm calling into this number and so during the course of the call to the agent has the option to you know add notes or take down notes with respect to that specific call  and all like with respect to the chat at the end of the call the system would pull up a pop up asking if you'd like to convert this into a ticket so once you say yes or all that all it does is you know it comes again on top of the cue and you know how they call recording embedded against that specific ticket too so that you know coming into it they can definitely go ahead and do that.,
