So in reporting we provide three levels of reporting one is the high level executive reporting in terms of top search queries top products added to cart top zero result queries top click products gives you a very high level understanding sorry in terms of what are your top searches what are your non performing searches what our top performing products non-performing products and what is your traffic or from search versus browse then the next level is a query level in-depth reporting for each each and every query on your site. And this is not your top 50 queries top 250 queries out of 500 queries right this is dependent on time you can look at last one one data three months data six months data one year data and then start evaluating what are your top queries are what in general every query is performing like so say for dresses what our hits conversion CTR orders if I click on both this is trend line in terms of conversion how the sales have been for dresses over a period of time and what are the products which are associated with this particular query and what is that each and individual products performance. On the flip side product level reporting if you have merchants category category managers looking at a particular set of products they can come here and see each and individual product performance so say this particular product what are the views what are the add to cart. They click on product again we will get a trend line in terms of performance and sales and some of the queries that this particular product is associated with . So that's the reporting piece any questions.,
