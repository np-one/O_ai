alright so if this is the case you know there would be an internal loop created in the system when your support email as well as the agents email happens to be the same which will not lead to creating of tickets Darren so ideally what I would suggest you is if this is the support email to which the customers reach out you can create this as your support email but from an agents perspective with the with with you know with the to do with the login message you can have an alternate email if that's alright.,
