okay perfect and I can send you this report I don't know if in what size the type of contract you are in with them which are evaluating alternatives I don't you have an opportunity there or not but we have three distinct products Lauren so while it seems like it was to focus on site search it was primarily because after the initial participant feedback we realised that site search is the biggest opportunity for you guys in terms of where the user experience is lacking so from navigation perspective for example if I were to navigate this seems to be doing its job because you guys have figured out where the right high-level categories to show so the customers going to quickly get to individual subcategory the search however is not doing the same functionality and I don't know how what percentage of customers on the site search you have a huge catalog acting from from what I can tell which tells me that you will have a healthy percentage of customers using a site search and if site says here's a very good rule of thumb that you can use to measure whether your site searches optimized or not if your let's say your overall site site conversion overall site conversion is 18 percent or 5 percent your site search conversion should be at at least two to three times your overall effective evolution if it is not if it is one and a half time or close to one time your slicers definitely means an update and then you're losing out then you can easily identify what is the opportunity you're picking out so let's say your site conversion at 3% your site search site conversion at 3% site search is at 5% assuming that it should be at least twice or three times let's say 6% to nine percent depending on what percentage traffic you get you can very easily calculate what the lost opportunity is from a search .,
