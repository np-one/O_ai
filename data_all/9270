And this is something based on time and you can look at last one month one week one year reports and also download them CSV or in Excel format from right here with the new dashboard there is a little more detailed reporting in terms of what your per search revenue is what's your total search of anyways what's a total site revenues and some of the more I would say revenue driven statistics. Then the next is the query level reporting here you have all the search queries on the site during a particular time frame shows you hits views click-through CTRs conversions and orders for each of your search queries and I click on this query stop up showing the trendline how the query has been performing over a period of time right with regards to the sales how this query is converting with regards to sales and you will also have list of products and that are converting for this particular query what other products which are performing which are not not performing you can come in see it. On the flip side say if you have category managers who come and look at your products or product performance on the database is they can come here look at each of your product on the site today how this product is performing with regard to views in that regard and if I click on it again shows me a trend line the sales trend line for this particular product and the queries for which this particular product shows up and performs for and how it performs for each of these searchs. And again all of these reports can be downloaded into Excel and CSV formats. So that's the solution.,
