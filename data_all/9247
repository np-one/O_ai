And the last thing is the zero results page every site is going to have zero stage irrespective of how great the search solution is and there could be various reasons for it maybe you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or maybe the search queries so butchers really difficult to understand the intent of the customers. Right we believe that the onus is on us To start guiding the customer whenever they encounter a zero results page  and here is an example right on this site you see what we have done is place two different widgets recently viewed and recommendations now recently viewed other other products that that that that particular customer would have looked at in that particular session or in the prior session on the side this gives them the ability to go back in their crawler discovery journey now. Based on their affinities towards a brand towards a color towards a price point towards a style we start recommending some of the products that they would be more like able to buy right. And this gives them the ability to move ahead in their products product discovery a journey without maybe returning to the search box or to your navigation menu so that's the search solution any any questions do you like it not like it was this something worth your time.,
