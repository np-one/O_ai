When a zero results page happens you know the customer has to restart it so they can't move forward or to go back don't either hit the back button or go back to the category page or something like that. So only helping the customer figure out how to go back by showing them some solutions and reviewed products which is something we also do. But we would also suggest to provide some recommendations so that if they wanted to actually move forward and these recommendations should be based on that their real time behaviour on that site in that session. And so by doing both you give the option to go back or to go forward another element in terms of a user experience piece is let's say I'm looking at these shoes and I really love these shoes what if I wanted to see more of these shoes without creating that pogo effect right. I'm sure you the pogo sick effect where you see customer's going to PDP page come back go into the second one come back we want to make sure that we give them a quick way to identify not just more details about that product but also alternatives. So you guys already have today the Adobe recommendations you could easily create an experience and say I'm looking at these shoes can I show some alternatives to that particular shoe next experience same thing on mobile.,
