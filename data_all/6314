there's three things you need one is you have to push the catalogues well that's pretty straightforward give us a jump on an SFTP or we have a plugin for Magento we can pull it etc second is deployer analytics that's also very straightforward it's somebody's one hours of work to actually do that it's like a Google Analytics tag is put into the adder and done third is the actual search results page right and you put two scripts one for the auto complete because it will go on every page and second for the search results of let's say if I'm searching for dress search for dress you can see that the header is rendered by you everything from the search results is rendered by us and then he renders a footer this way your IT team all they have to do is give us a page render the header render the footer and give us a div tag in the middle and put our script and we'll render the entire result so everything you can see from 288 results for dress including the pagination all the way down is completely rendered by Unbxd and it is extremely fast we render within 300 milliseconds which is something is an industry standard and that's part of our SLA so that's why it's easy to you customise a solution for you specifically nobody else does we make the approach extremely simple so that you don't have to get a lot of IP approvals lot of IP hours in somebody's work of day were four times actually integrator.,
