yeah I agree I don't know what you know we've been working the past six months and finding you know other other ways or we we have for the past year. we've been running email re-marketing emails which are you know which are successful maybe not as much as we'd like but nothing never as much as you like you know there's definitely there's definitely someone for improvement you know I think you know you guys could definitely you know be one of the keys to that. there's the thing you know three years ago I spent 250 thousand dollars on cost per click advertising and our number were over one percent in conversions but I didn't make any more money so we thought you know we stopped spending we stopped spending all that on advertising on clicks. because while the sales were there and the traffic was there that we were doing three times as much but we weren't making any more profits so the only people that were winning was Google and Amazon you know and I was up at night you know working hard and I didn't get to take a rest.,
