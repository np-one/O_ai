If you look at US Patriot say if you go to any specific category say police and duty you will see multiple widgets right on the first home page itself. One you would see is choose option widget the other one you would see is like a more like this widget what has happened is more like this is the alternate product discovery widget. It will not take you to a new browser or a new window and cut short your search experience but it will just open up a small modal window. There is a custom I can choose some options if I like something I can click on this option if I don't like something I can just close and move on with my search experience.,
