now this you can do for a 90-day trial period for example if you were to come in and say let's just give these guys 10% traffic or 20% traffic depending on what they're comfortable with and we can try the hosted search for 90 days so it's minimum impact on you maximum impact on us or the onus is on us and all you do is get us a sub domain redirect sub domain to us if there's an SSL or anything like and enable course and that's it the second option is the back end which is what obviously you want to use for the long term but it requires more onus on you and your team so we suggest the hosted search for short term while you prove us out we prove prove it to you you want to now take the long term approach you can do the back end and now you can dedicate engineers to do it just do some of the back and work and it's restful api is responses in json xml that you can render.,
