yeah I mean that's not quite as you know maybe material perhaps but but we don't have that many attributes for items to I mean like our data the just most of our items don't have attributes beyond the category which they're assigned to which in a way becomes an attribute one of our main attributes is whether something is original or reproduction so we when you serve something the filters you'll see you know original or new made and international availability because many of our items are available to go overseas and you know the same with PayPal sometimes some items can't be paid with by PayPal..so I've always known that attributes it just depends because you know for instance if you're looking for an antique gun the choice to buy that antique gun is not that it's twelve inches versus sixteen and it's not that it's made out of brass or steel do you know what I mean it might be that French versus English. yes.but that that falls under category.,
