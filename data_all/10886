got it so what we want to make sure is the conversion absolutely has to be the end coin but we also want to make sure that demonstratively people are able to find products the customers are able to find products they're clicking on it and going to and adding to cart.  so we can then start working in parallel the other stuff so possibly beginning of August is when we can go live.  if they actually don't convert the fact that they're adding to cart to conversion is there something else something else that's going on maybe the checkout is too long maybe you guys introduced a survey that people don't want to answer it takes turns them off I don't know what how changes happen.  but we want to make sure there's 2 or 3k kpi not just one reliance but then ultimately it's your decision even within the 90 days as you can see in the agreement we have not put any fill fine print if the Sun is not shining in Los Angeles that day you guys can cancel it right we learned that.  the only to be fair to us we just want we request and you look at the KPI not just one KPI about a couple of them.,
