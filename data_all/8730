This actually this opens up an another opportunity for us also and and walk you through that element is also error tolerance in terms of how how good is the site think it has error tolerance in terms of correcting some of these spelling mistakes it should be in any way which could be say someone coming from the blog and copy psting misspelled query or a word or say they themselves trying to type it and then typing it say misspelling I will walk you through that right. So That is also a very important piece of site searchable yep then I look for say blue sofa I mean something that Gave me the result photo frames you have quite a few photo frames on the right hand side you see but when I actually search for photo frames it limits me only to two of these the others are probably not photo frames but some sort of frames or wall arts not right products look for gifts under dollar hundred and I did that because you also have a category for for gifts gifts under doll 100 but when I type this right which is also a natural language query returns as a result page. Then I look for chairs chairs did give me first full of of results and as a customer I say wanted to buy the cheapest chair so I quickly did a sort by function that you have a price low to high and it actually returned our change to others on the first fold to pillow covers. Then look for stemmed words bench versus benches again the intent here does not change singular or plural customer is looking for bench ideally but the set of results that that you see is different they are all benches no doubt but not the best way to kind of show the results it is important that we start understanding the intent of the customer over and above what what they are actually typing .,
