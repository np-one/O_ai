Got it so when you take a look dictionary you might come in and say oh this glasses with misspelled doesn't exist in here so you add it I'm assuming that's like a synonym library that you might create. Got it perfect and I think this is unfortunately the typical limitation of some of those traditional products because unless until you create a synonym for every single permutation and combination of how a word is misspelled if that combination shows up you will not see the right set of results right.,
