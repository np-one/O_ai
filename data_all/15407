So basically very much connected to doing so this kind of stuff but as you know yourself it takes a lot of fine-tuning figuring out what what the combination works what does not work how to do ranking and so on some house is very very straightforward more or less you took the initial version was using Solr and that was pretty much out of the box using it as it is just beautiful texture and then what we do with the category pages is basically just return the results based on the specific keys and then just retrieve the data that was there and then the ranking that be was very stupid it's just like by how many products how many sold in the last 14 days or something like that and then that's how we rank the product so and currently it's just a document database that we just do full-text search on and. So that much is good but we also know that we need to enrich it a lot with a lot of data and that is where the challenge is so and and to mention one thing because we have outside ones in multiple languages so we try to localize our website to each each country that we go into currently and we have seven websites but six different country we're not calm just like you know serving everybody else who speaks English. So and and the plan is to open lo local company so within the next couple of months we've got the french websites belgium is coming up Poland Austria so four more sites planning for this year so obviously this a lot of products that means translated and furthermore in order to do like some of the stuff demoing so far just right T's like we would never write te es for for product because this is name for it. What we wanna do is just focus on writing what the real name of the product is what does the grow and call the card and make sure that all the other websites go in and and translate it to the in the correct format and then later on then we could do things like you know keywords and so on but we have another product so this takes a lot of times like in which it with it's some of the stuff yeah yeah some things that would make it really cool to work with you that's the main challenge.,
