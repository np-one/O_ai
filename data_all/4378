Compatibility search right sometimes people are looking for product A that is compatible to product B right I was looking for say wall mounts for 50 inch monitors again it starts showing you some of the monitor these are not even 50 inch monitors these are some 21 point 5 inch monitors  but not the wall mount and that's where so with us when we split these these words into each each and every I would say word and start understanding the attribute of each of these words and start putting assigning the weightages to them we are able to understand that that the customer is actually looking wall for wall mounts that might be compatible for a 50 inch monitor and not a monitor by itself here is an example tops for jeans right someone looking for tops for jeans we understand that and we immediately start showing tops and not the jeans.,
