so so that gives us a good idea Andrew so in in terms of the next step so it it seems like there's a few steps we need to cover before we get to a certain level of understanding as to what the next steps might be so the next steps will work on the mobile piece will work come up with some ideas I can also share our implementation approaches so that you can you can start some of the tech conversations if they look at this there's a very minimal minimally invasive way where we can do this it's called the Ajax approach but I also include the other approaches that we use in case you wanna go down a different path and then the third thing is we will send you some questions and you if you can give us some idea on either the number of products you have the number of sessions you I can also give you some idea on the pricing so hopefully that different views of the world of everything that you need and then you can chew on it and then we can maybe in a week or so start bothering you again to see what your feedback is and then you can keep polishing it to how you want to have the conversation is that sounds like a plan getting ahead of ourselves.,
