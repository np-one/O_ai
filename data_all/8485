And not necessarily that that all of these UI elements might fit into your business but again to show you how few of these elements can be customized right facets and filters it was good to see that you do have facets and filters but these are very static right static in two ways one is filter by category filter by brand there are these two or three elements that's show up for each of your products I'm sure there are various different elements and that could also be searchable or non searchable. And number two was the order or the or the filters that are available they're usually in the alphabetic order right especially on the on the category side and the on the brand side I know they were they were more from the count of the products that you have today right the higher the count of the brand comes on top. With us what we do differently is make these filters dynamic in nature in two ways so to give you an example say for jeans as a category you might want to come and set the right set of filters right it could be gender size type fit availability price right now irrespective of how someone searches for jeans right so it could be blue jeans black jeans red jeans skinny jeans. Sometimes they might not even use the word jeans and they might come in and say Levi's right as far as 75% or more products in that on that search results page are from jeans as a category the jeans filters would automatically kick in right that's one level of dynamicness. Now two the second way that that these filters could be made dynamic is once you set these orders say gender size type fit if over a period of time people were clicking on fit more often then fit would come on top gender would go down the row right so that's the second level of of dynamicness into the filters. Then the third level of dynamicness obviously is say in your case could be brand right say brand right for for this particular filter there's a category if Purafill as a brand was more popular then Purafill would come on top and filtration group would go down.,
