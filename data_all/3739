perfect let's do that - so now as you know agents of the system there are a couple of ways in which you could respond one is where you get directly hit the reply button and send forth your reply so you see that you say it is fine reach out to you and I can say sure you know suggest a date and time right and you could go about sending this response and once you send this response it's going to go back to that person who requested for this and for an agent it's going to be part of the same ticket thread that you see here so what I would do for better tracking purposes is I would as soon as I send out I send out send out this response that come at change the stages to say something like you know awaiting on customers response right so that I'd dont know that you know the balls of the customers code and I can't wait for the response from them before I maybe looked into this ticket again right and since I answered this at also assign myself as an agent to this ticket so that you know that gives me that says me as the person responsible for this current query that's coming right so these are a couple of things from an agents side so now coming back from a customer's point of view this is going to come back to them in the form of that same email thread that you sent out so from a customer centric view it's going to be seamless to him where it is still going to be an email transaction happening and from agents perspective you have the pop-up ticket here right so this is a simple straightforward way in which you could reply to a ticket and of course when you're applying you also have options to make use of scanned responses which is nothing but certain sets of pre-configured email templates that you could have it set up in your system and when query related to that comes in you know you plug it back and when it comes back right so that you could make use of these scanned responses and so that's about how you know the ways in which you can yes.,
