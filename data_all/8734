Okay so before I get onto the solution right why search typically we we have Noticed that our customers actually see there's there's a search influencing at least twenty to forty percent of the revenue on the site and might be coming from Google they might be coming from some other site copy paste the title you are the product that they are looking for and and you know copy it from from one one site or one location and then start pasting it on various different sites and quickly start searching for products that they are looking for. Not just that but 80% of the visitors abandon the site if they're not able to find something right and they come on the site they search and and and not to forget that these are the customers who are 60% more probable to convert because they're searching . And 80 percent of them just abandon if they are not able to find what they are looking for we change this for Express and then I wanted to put this as a quote here from the Express CEO he addressed this in in one of his press conversation after the the q2 reports from Express and then after implementing Unbxd going live with us. Why Unbxd high-level business technology merchandising controls mobile performance SLA on business we understand your business your unique differentiator why customers buy from you and then and start replicating that on the overall product discovery experience that the customer has on your site. Site search being so intrinsic for each site something that works for you would not work for your competition or say something that works for Ashley home furniture so today might not be the best thing for your site right.,
