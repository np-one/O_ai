But I generally don't use the word replacement because most IT folks don't like it especially when they've put a year of migrating from say one to another and you come and say that you're replacing it they generally don't like it so it's a politically correct statement to sometimes make that we could actually coexist show the value then if we're actually making more sense then probably they'll take a decision of replacing the existing solution with us so.,
