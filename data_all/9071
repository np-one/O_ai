Adaptive got it yep so you can have different experiences both for Just up and mobile depending on how you have to find it and these are all the different components in terms of how you can use a merchandise dashboard one last piece get this we I wanted to show you before you leave and you gotta go five minutes but I'll show you our it's a quick video of our merchandising dashboard and this is specifically for the category pages and this is something Endeca cannot do today and Gary this is this is something we've built with merchants in buying because what we've seen is you spend a lot of time marketing spends a lot of time and effort and money to bring customers from the top of the funnel right you'll do emails till the social media you'll do SEO SPM a PPC campaigns etc just to bring customers to the site you also have your flyers and customers use your flyers to look online but when they come online the experience is for every single customer is exactly the same no matter where they came from so what we've built is let's say you have a particular category page let's say you have shampoo and for shampoo you want to run a campaign for this week or for two weeks so you can have a start date time and date time and then you can decide how you want to run this shampoo campaign. You can define a particular segment of customers to say I'm gonna send an email promoting say the PNG shampoo or the Pantene one or the Garnier one and specifically for customers were coming from email or this geography I want to show a particular experience for the page shampoo page and you can define that segment and control that and will also give you on the right-hand side a forecast of the number of customers you're going to influence based on the historical data. Sometimes we might have competing ideas say you you your merchants are making a deal with P&G Pantene and Garnier and you want to make sure that you're able to shoot both of them you can split the traffic you can create a version a of the merchandising and of course be split traffic 50/50 or 30 30 and then 40 percent is the base algorithm . And you can see how and who the winner is in terms of performance and then for specifically for the merchandising component you have the ability to boost products to slot products to pin products filter out products etc.,
