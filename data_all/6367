so we have up to that complexity and availability for you to do that so that's a min for you let's say you also have clearance stuff let's say you have some products that are too high in inventory the opposite problems and you want to get rid of that inventory also we also have a diversity side or a diversity algorithm that figures out to say can I show best selling product which will always be low in inventory with some high inventory products because you might put them on sale maybe other clearance etc so try to make sure that those high inventory products also get the visibility and you've got to reduce them out of inventory.,
