Yes I'll show you three various different ways of implementation but typically what we are looking at for the POC is an in page Ajax and I'll share complete details in terms of how that is being implemented there is another one which is hosted approach we don't usually recommend it. Because it creates a negative impact on the SEO but if you have IT staff limitations you cannot you do not have technical staff internally who can look into things then you might want to go for hosted but but we don't recommend it in pages Ajax the recommended way and then on a longer term post POC if you want to do an API integration. That thing we can also do that and also include the steps for that so a detailed implementation document that I'll share with the deck.,
