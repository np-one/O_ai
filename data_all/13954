I know that a lot of your products might be related to one gender but let's assume this for simplicity case we want to try to show how complex the queries can be and what is it that we're bringing to the table so when I search for women's white jeans today everything in the market that's out there whether you're using a inbecka solar or any other elastic search doesn't matter what tool you're using you have one of three outdated techniques to actually solve for this query you have orange through my search for women's or white or jeans which is a problem because you might end up showing why choose white jackets then you have ending we have women's and white ending this is also a problem because some products may not have the word all keywords so it will actually show you very few results and in some times it also ends up creating more zero results pages for you.,
