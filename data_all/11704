So while a user is buying one product you're probably recommending two or three products which are closest to that user so that you dramatically increase the average order value. At manier times a user might actually be looking for that product but he might not have the time to go and find that product or he might think that he or she will probably buy the product next next time got on your site. But you actually capture the user attention right here so this is where actually a collection of algorithms come into play so one we look at is the entire product detail in the content theme itself where we start understanding what is this product that the user is buying and what can be Clubbed. And the second thing we also looked at is our entire upsell cross-sell of themes where we look kind of somebody buying product a what is more likely grouped or can be grouped with product a so that we make more sense because you don't want to be showing the wrong set of products when you complete the set. So initially what we do for this especially for this widget we take some inputs from you your team as well so we tied try it out for a few set of categories where you where you say that okay in my analytics I know that somebody buying a will also buy B and C for sure more likely to buy b and c for sure. So we basically custom build it initially but once you have slightly more data from your system and probably after say three months to four months this starts working like a charm and we've seen consistently across all customers are said this is one of the most popular widget from a business standpoint.,
