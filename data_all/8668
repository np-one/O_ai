The only reason I brought this up is because you said that you know there are certain things you do outsource because you can't solve everything and I figured that if this if the spell check piece the autocorrection piece is lined up to be overtime in the long term and there's a lot of other stuff that needs to be done first maybe in the parallel you could come in and just arguments like we said we can sit right next to Endeca and it's not an on-prem it's a it's a SAS solution. So you don't have to install or anything like that it's simple API call you get zero results from Endeca you get some results from Unbxd give it a try our responses will be in the exact same format as Endeca so your application doesn't have to change either so you get exactly the same result set or the format for the result set. And you were able to make the decision easily enough to say show one or the other.,
