the problem this customer was facing well they be used to take almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy the product so what we did was we read annoying the solution to look like this with the auto complete where it actually shows personalised relevant products based on their past behaviour so if you buy chicken without skin in Jonah you see at the top if I buy chicken born less donuts then I'll see that up top okay and this is because in grocery you normally buy the same product every week or other week so that's why we were trying to show you the same product but if you if you were looking to buy products that you normally don't buy  you also have on the right-hand side we commonly searched terms some popular brand and some categories and this is all predictive in nature by typing chips it'll show me chip by type in Chilli it will show me Chilli by typing tomato it'll show me tomato okay here's an example of a customer the outlet it I don't know if you know them out of London and so this is what our interpretation was poor outlet where they sell designer products that if it cap right so designers are extremely important to that.,
