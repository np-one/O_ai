Alright so and then the next thing is our parent company has a feature called C switch and save and so what that does is let's say you're looking at pair of gloves its recommendation I think they do this manually. They don't do do it via an algorithm visually they loaded it up in the backend and you're looking at a pair of gloves and their site will show you another pair of gloves it's not an upsell or so for say it's actually a product that cost less but the margin the profit on it is greater. So the idea is for the customer okay here are some gloves but we've got other gloves that could save you money so why don't you buy these other gloves so it's a it's good for the customer but it's also good for the that for the company because um the cheaper gloves actually has a greater profit margin. And so in this case we almost to be able to feed into your widget some attribute called you know profit margin you know and the widget needs to say okay look for a complementary product that costs less but has the highest gross profit.,
