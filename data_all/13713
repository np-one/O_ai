next is guard uniform so I searched for guard uniform I get only seven results all of them are rain coats and some gloves okay another aspect of that training weapons there's tons of training weapons guns knives etc but only two products show up first aid kits so here's a different type of site search difference I wanted to show you I searched for first aid kits with no space between first in aid and then a first space aid kits by the way the type-ahead gives me both suggestions so if if I were to you can now see if I did first will give me first space aid as a suggestion however if in this instance I didn't use the space and started to type in aid it will give me first aid kit as one of the suggestions also without the space however here's the unfortunate rub if I search without the space I actually get 517 results if I do use space I get only hundred thirty-five results now I've not gone through all 500 1 35 to actually see are they relevant or not but this is a big problem in case 517 is right or Eve 135 is right one of them is wrong then this is a problem both search queries should actually give you exactly the same sets of results okay.,
