okay and these are simple things like take zero results today also you might have options where you end up being on a zero results page instead of showing a blank page what we do is just put in these two recommendation widgets right and again there's nothing that you will have to configure the system automatically pulls up the data and starts displaying results. what it does in recently view is while I come onto your site and spend five minutes you pick ten products is there are five products or four products where I have spent more time on I've have done some action I've either looked at product detail page I have to either add them added them on my wish list it basically understands the implicit actions that I've done on my on your site in my current session and just shows those products in recently viewed so that I have already shown an intent I'm probably more likely to re look at those products again. and then these top rated products we look at your last 30 days of machine learning and we understand that which are the most popular brands in products on your site and we display them. so that the we have seen that okay a user coming in from say from LA is most likely you to buy such products and this is what my data has told me we're start showing in the same product widget so and again these are very small simple levers that we start pulling out and we've seen that when you mix all of them together add them together it will start making a much of different.,
