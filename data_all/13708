sure if you're a really fast typer yes absolutely but not all customers are really fast typers that's number one number two the other piece also is the type of heads function is not just to create pattern matches to give you exactly what you're about to type in if I'm about to type in steel toe boots let's say three keywords or steel or toe boots or blue boots let's say or black boots if I'm about to type in black boots the fact is that it's not to give you a suggestion and saying oh black boots you're searching for black boots now click on black boots that's not the idea the idea is to give the customer three variety of distinct elements one is if I have just typed in black and there are different ways how black can be interpreted based on an attribute versus based on a product type a lot of customers would prefer not to type in the word boots they just see it and they click on it okay a lot of times customers are just looking for category you're not as soon looking for a specific set of product a very unique way to search for a product it's just that they like the convenience and speed of search so they just want to type it in the category but as soon as you give them the category they don't have to type it in they don't have to go through the whole navigation aspect which could get cumbersome the third piece is discover ability is let's say I am searching for let's say security badges Lorraine the example that I was talking about great example you might the customer may not realise that you also carry gear or accessories that could help them in a rainy condition or rainy day or they their waterproof etc and while the customer may not have come to the site to buy that kind of product exposing them to that also creates an opportunity where they might be thinking of buying it they don't know that you sell it now they do you'll at least get the chance to earn their business for that particular piece which they might have been thinking of going somewhere else to buy the product and that's the function of the type-ahead it's not necessarily just to help them finish that query it is to get to get them to a category if possible maybe get them to a brand if that's what they were looking for show them some some top suggestions so that they also see what if they're just browsing it also depends the the state of mind of the customer is it a lot of times search customers have very clear intent but that may not necessarily be true they just may be browsing for certain products without intent and in that case you want to expose them to more things than they might have come into this pie so that's the that's the reason what the type of head actually functions and why it needs to be adaptive to what the customer is trying to do now what you see here today what's being developed today is a very standardised way of how autocomplete has been done and I'll show you some of the ways that unboxd has done when we've taken a very different approach the approach we've taken with type-ahead is not necessarily just to expose in a very serial manner what the keyboard pattern match would provide it's to actually guide the customer what galls cells has been sold by a lot of other retailers there's a lot of competition right would you agree but there is the reason why customers come in and buy from you and what is that differentiator that you have and how they buy from you has to be reflected into the search experience so long-winded answer to your question I hope that I answered you a question.,
