yeah absolutely I think on the of course its not a live in market test its of course a test on a training set right like where we have a training set with the ages and you know what we're trying to infer the ages I think are generally on the gender and age while and not the personally the person who built that algorithm from what I've heard from them this we have a fairly good accuracy of closing in on 90 (okay I know its a challenge) right sorry and apart from this positioning and marketing I think to answer your question John about you know what the other areas we can help I think supply chain would be extremely critical for you especially that this is global operations right. so areas like demand forecasting and not just demand forecasting and you know the traditional demand forecasting where you can do it at the most granular levels of you know humid geography level and be able to generate your sales plans based on that being able to do your inventory analysis based on that so we have I wouldn't call it as a tool or a product but its a very loosely integrated stack of accelerators which we have used to deliver solutions across and an integrated planning tool to come right from like I mentioned demand forecasting to inventory allocation that sort of covered the good span of supply chain and additionally our capabilities with network optimization and inventory optimization I think would be good fit for them not see that.,
