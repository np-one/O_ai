Yeah absolutely so I mean it makes sense because today you are probably caching because the search results are does not change from one user to the other or from session to session and it also produces the hits that you have on your servers but if you want to start getting personalized even if it was not personalized for example just our user behavior based changes for a particular query the search results can change what is the frequency with which you clear the cache or the refresh for the cache happens.,
