so I belong to the pre-sales team so this is my this is all the tickets that my team receives right so all these are new tickets as you can see is all new tickets and it's not been assigned to any agent so when I pick up this ticket and I start working on this this ticket automatically be assigned my name as an agent and so this could be your outbound callers view where they see all the tickets right and when they interact with the customer and the customer respond to them you know back and forth conversation so I've also create another view just for myself saying you know Jay's is open and pending tickets so when I click on that I'll be able to see all the open and pending tickets I have open a my name.,
