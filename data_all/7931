So we give a lot more flexibility for merchandisers to define what kind of campaigns they run and as they are going and running the campaign we also show you the sticker which tells you within your analytics what's the potential reach of this campaign going towards right and once you create this campaign what we also realized is marketing teams will have conflicting ideas so the best way to see which idea works best for your customers is to actually letting them do an a/b test on live traffic once you've chosen a segment for the campaign also a/b test it and say I decide the winner of an a/b test by the highest number of clicks or Add to Cart or say actual conversions itself and whichever campaign wins in a/b test that campaign is effective for the rest of the time period of the campaign right.,
