No it is outside of the platform all we would need is the product catalogue feed so what we do is an in page ajax implementation right so you continue to own the domain you continue to render the header and the footer for every search results page what we do is we we insert an empty div tag or we put an empty div tag and start inserting the search results through HTML that's one way of implementation. The second way is obviously the API right wherein we build these connectors the back-end implementation right we build these connectors to start regularly pulling up data automatically from your system and that start talking to the e-commerce platform and start rendering results. From a POC perspective what most of our e-commerce customers prefer is an in page Ajax if you look at Express or if you look at Ashley Furniture so they're still on an in page Ajax implementation. Because that gives them a very quick way of implementing the solution and testing it to decide if they would want to go for a longer I would say a longer effort<>.,
