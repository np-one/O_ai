Yes and the way we do the on boarding of a customer is we do of 50 percent POC meaning you pay us so this is how the deal is you pay us 50 percent for the implementation right we kick start the implementation we take the site live.  You test us out for sixty days and for those sixty days you pay us only 50 percent of the monthly fee so you pay us 50 percent of the implementation field 50 percent for the first two months monthly fees during the phase of testing us out post sixty days if you like the solution and if you decide to continue with Unbxd you pay the remaining 50% and continue on the actual monthly recurring fee.,
