okay so so this is pretty straightforward but the first is the piece where there are a lot of elements involved so this documentation for example will give you an idea of the different steps that are involved within search so product feed is something been obviously getting directly from the recommendation module that we have on Shopify so that's not a problem the analytics integration is something that is again taken care of through the recommendation module itself so again nothing new you gotta do there but then we have two of these pieces one is the unboxers and one is the autosuggest now let's go to unboxd so the first thing we have in unboxd site is <> we do is we do an in page ajax implementation on the Shopify templates so that we can get our running during this inferior aJax implementation what we take care of is ensuring that the service listings work the way they are supposed to the facets and the filters are you know put on the left-hand side and then you multi select in nature and so on so all of those elements are taken care off within this as well and beside that what you also have to take care is any of the pagination that's working how we need to go ahead and implement that and all the sort options that you have for a sort by price and sort by name or sort by bestsellers and so on so there are a lot of these elements that we need to integrate as part of the third solution and that's the reason why it's best that I can get our team to work on this you're talking about up four to five days of implementation time at our end to get this up and running .,
