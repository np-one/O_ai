Customer map the search term matches the taxonomy you'll get redirected to that category page category or subcategory the next thing I noticed in a lot of cases was no matter what I searched for so let's say I searched here for pillows. Here I searched for candles I think I might have searched for some chairs here if you can see the filters on the left are always the same it's categories availability other options price categories availability other options price categories availability other options price. But you also know Shannon and Mike that customers do use different facets for different categories of products for candles maybe color is extremely important to me maybe price is more important to me maybe the type of candle is more important. Maybe the fragrance right totally forgot the fragrance a fragrance is probably the most important thing so what we have built now it's very easy to do that by the way mind you on if I go to where our candles lighting candles if I go to and I'll just open it in a new window. Ah look at that type in the first one so on the category pages you if you have the ability to say look we can structurally facet in the order of importance because this is how customers buy and you know that you are only showing candles here. But on search results page I can search for candles a thousand different ways right I could search for flame-less candles I can search for <> candles citrus smell candles whatever right and so thousand different ways so how do you actually figure out.,
