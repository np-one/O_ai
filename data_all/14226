and just before I get started just wanted to give you a quick background on how we have built our entire relevancy algorithm because it's it's a fact today to talk about machine learning and AI everybody talks about that but I wanted to show some more light how we've approached this yes it's a machine learning platform Yes it's a artificial intelligence but the way we have built and from the day we started building the platform is we've actually trained the algorithm with over 200 million products in the retail landscape we also trained it per vertical so the system today can understand when you refer to something at women's white jeans in apparel or a 2% nonfat dairy milk in grocery what does those two search queries actually mean right because from any detailed context it's all very different because most search algorithms have been built using the whole tf-idf concept but even Google today for search uses that the only issue with the tf-idf algorithm is it's primarily built for document search and not necessarily for retail product search.,
