Thanks so John just continue on the point of what Rohit was talking about I see we are the the 10 min mark I want to spend about you know 5 minutes kind of giving you a little perspective on our deeper perspective on on what we do in engineering and our relationship with you know what we do with Microsoft alright and and then maybe want to ask you know especially around specifics around what you're looking forward to your area is right and and then then we can take conversation further so see I think one one thing you would see the way we have been structured right is we are a  organization but I think what is most important for us is  do we have the the right way of engaging with our customers right.,
