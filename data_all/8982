And then if you want much more detailed reporting per query and per product you can you can look at what what's converting what's the conversion rate what's the hit right so say dresses I click on dresses I get a trendline how the how the query is performing and what are the products associated with it. And on the flip side same thing for all your products how each product is performing and against what queries the search queries do these products performing right so that's the another level of reporting.,
