again this is another UI element right if there is a similar product widget that you have on your site so if you click on this instead of taking you to a new browser which kind of inhibits my experience what we do is we basically open this in a modal window right. I'll show it to you on even this US Patriots have this to be more like this option I click on this it does not take me to a new browser or new window what you see is it opens up in a modal window shows me all the options I can choose if I want if I like something so I don't like something I just closed and move on with with my current search experience again a very subtle UI variation. and by default everything that works on a laptop works on a mobile device as well this is how it will work on a mobile responsive site or an app and you.,
