all right so let's think about it from a perspective of how do customers discover products so what are the things that how customers may want to do it is through these banners so you certainly have cities on the homepage you have certain experiences these are probably what we call it your top sellers let's say or maybe your featured activities right but you might also want to show and slightly different elements based on how many times a customer has comment so you might want to show top sellers you might want to show feature sellers you might like you talked about you know there's a there's a new activity that has come in and you want to promote a new activity how do you create a merchandising element where your merchants and marketing team can control what activities show up on a flip side if you wanted to personalise the activities for the customer you definitely want to show recommend it for that particular customer based on the behaviour that that customer has right so those activities recently viewed you might want to show that the homepage so let's say for example Saturday morning I'm looking at your sights you know kids come into the room things happen now I'm coming back to the site on Sunday how can you get me back to those activities very quickly that I was looking at yesterday right center left type of recently viewed and personal and and make recommendations based on what I looked at yesterday when I come back to the homepage right there on the homepage and how do you influence that behavior then when I'm looking at a particular activity let's say I'm looking at the I'm assuming this is the oh this is in Milan got it and I thought maybe this was the Louvre but Louvre is in the Paris is so let's say I'm looking at this particular activity and you have related events either based on location right because if I'm going to Milan am I staying in Milan for a few days and do I want to do all the activities in Milan or do I recommend other similar activities that might be in other cities in the same country right I don't know how customers buy from you or why do you buy from you and what that differentiator is that you know what type of typical customer comes in and buys from you or schedule these activities we can customise that solution accordingly but this is where the next set of influence would be where if I'm looking at this particular activity how can you recommend other stuff to me right could it be other similar stuff or other related stuff like okay I did the museum tour can I get a food tour for my evening plans for my dinner right or some sort of a cultural activity like a theatre or something in the evening that I can go to and or you might want to package it to say maybe there's a couple of activities that go together as a bundle say do this on Saturday do this on Sunday for local customers right and do you have a lot of local customers also it's or is just mainly tourists .,
