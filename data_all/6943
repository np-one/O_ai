okay yeah as I told you we've had enough use cases and I think the one good thing that we could do is it's an easy tool to quickly test for you like we can put something up together where you can test it within a two-month window we build it in a month and you test it another month so you can see how a specific relevancy mapping works even before you make a buying decision on the products.,
