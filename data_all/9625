Maybe you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or the search queries so butcher that it's really difficult for the technology to understand the intent of the customer. And in that case we believe that the onus is on us to start guiding the customer and we do this in real time highly personalized for each user by placing two different widgets here recently viewed and recommendations. Recently viewed are the products that the customer would have looked at during that session or the prior session on the site and now based on their affinity towards the brand towards the price point towards the colour based on that and attributes of the products. We now start recommending some of the products that they would be more like able to buy now this gives them the ability to either go back or go forward in their product discovery journey on on the site.,
