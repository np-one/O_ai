And then putting the onus on the customer to click on the right color swatch and then start seeing seeing the red color images of these products we have built a technology that is able to automatically start showing me the variants images given you have the variants image indexed in your feed we pick up the variants image and start showing those for a search result page. And then we take it to the next next level to our color synonyms. So say I come onto your side and I look for a chocolate sofa just because that's the color I have in mind the system is able to understand That that the chocolate it comes from the brown color family if you have a chocolate sofa we obviously start showing that but if you do not have that we understand that say brown or tan coffee much more closer colors to chocolate and not the Reds are the whites of the other blacks right. So we immediately pick up some of the other colored products in the in the proximity and from the same color family and start showing those. Zero is a stage all sites are going to have zeros on stage and the reasons could be you don't carry a product you don't carry a brand or say the search query itself is so butchered that it's difficult for the search system to understand in that case we believe that it is important to start guiding the customer right the onus is on us to start guiding the customers rather than expecting them to go back to your search page or to your navigation.,
