One is I'm giving the customer options to very quickly get to where they might want to go because even when express a lot of categories not as many as Kirklands. But you want to get them not just to that high level aisle you want them to get to that very narrow category that they will commit to look for give them some free vidual feedback by showing them products popular products for that specific category or subcategory. But also give them some very specific search suggestions in case they have something like that in mind and that's based more on the popularity aspect or some keyword suggestions based on the products that you have. And you can see here one of the important things is how contextually we change the <origin so> for jeans there's win women's jeans and men's jeans and we'll show both right here. Now let's say I actually changed this to a dress you can see here for dress there's there are no men's dresses so we're only showing for women it's not a it's not a pre-built fixed format in which we do this. This is the whole component here is completely dynamic now let's see if I start to search for say a dress shirts if I now search for dress shirts against the only men shows up right.,
