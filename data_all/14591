first experience if you user I just seen three pages right that is I noticed and again Chris I'm not nitpicking on this this is for just to me to get a context on where the opportunity could actually right right then I did something similar for condoms look at you economist again look at a category page found eight results then when he looked at the search itself but the first result that I got was actually not a condom so I'm not sure if it's doing more of a text pattern match where it's looking at Eurex and condoms and showing either all of those products that's one observation I had. then I also the same thing with fruit flavored condoms jut looked up fruit flavored condoms in the search box the first four that I actually seen II did not have any bump,
