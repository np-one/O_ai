right so now coming to what we found and see there become today right so I wouldn't look for a paper shredder obviously you have this product on your site right but when I search for this product it's probably doing an anding or or-ing so it's showing me something to do with paper but it is not understanding the word shredder right so that's where it generally gets broken right now also why it was actually doing some research also found something on your site where say if I feel like I look for Red Hat cloud forums I just search it in a different way in a more natural language way I don't find anything but if you actually go to your site red hat cloud forums is one of your popular listings actually on the home page it you actually have something for Red Hat cloud forum it's one of your featured products but I look for cloud forum s Red Hat it essentially breaks the whole thing I add a white space in between for cloud space forums that usually breaks it right then I try looking for something slightly more specific on the site I look for P ti-84 calculator this is where it actually picks up because this entire word is actually present on these face so it actually performs the right result so it shows me the right things that I want to see maybe and then I look for certain natural language queries I look for a notebook under $500 you obviously have notebooks under $500 on the site when I do functionality but it does not bring it up and search right then I look for a Chromebook of a specific color you obviously have Chromebooks which have white and color but when I search for it it takes me to something extremely different right.,
