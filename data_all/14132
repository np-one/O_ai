when you say database driven site are you referring to the analytics that you track or no no no I mean you know that it would have to be on a platform like Shopify or magenta or one of those as opposed to no having it no not necessarily so what we do is from from from a data collection standpoint the first thing that we'd install on your site is our analytics is the Unbxd analytics and what that helps us do is essentially collect data from your shoppers real on a real-time basis and you know that that's pretty much how the machine learning piece comes into the picture where you know one is we are using all of you know the the keywords the queries that we've been indexed that's already trained and the second part is your business is unique to you and shoppers you know buy very differently on your site so we're also tracking that behaviour and are able to you know throw back rather than result so you know in the process we're training our system to understand and your catalogue in your product feed and and essentially you know that's how our relevancies built in.,
