So actually while we're on this topic I'll show you a quick video it's like a two minute dashboard video that we've built probably it might give you some more context on this if you could see my screen so one of the things we realize this no matter how strong an AI we build merchandisers will know their business better than everybody else so what we did is to add the segmentation logic we let merchandisers create custom landing pages or campaigns or vanity URLs for any kind of a query or a category right so A you can go and define a query and category and define rule sets along when do you start it when do you end it but then you also start defining segments today we give you the ability where you can go and define a custom landing page for say a new user coming in from an iPhone device from Manhattan Upper East and who has clicked on an email channel what is exactly the kind of products you want to show to him versus somebody who is a new visitor coming from a tablet device which is a Samsung tablet from New Jersey which is a Suburb coming in from a Facebook campaign.,
