so generally we've seen it in the pot in this space also we have a decent number of customers now so we have sensitize the algorithm to pick up words how it is spelled in this context but at the same time what we also do is when we start at implementation the first thing we implement is analytics it's a simple probably half an hour job at your end but while we do that implementation for the next four five weeks the system is all clean learning as to how people are keying in and buying products on your site so it's a lot more aware and a couple of things we could also do is if there are already some rules that you've built in more specifically if you've already done you could also import them so that on Damen the system is much more relevant to just not to your space but very specific to your brand and and it the whole idea here is how do we avoid you doing anything manually how can everything be automated so it's it's a combination of that sorry for the long answer.,
