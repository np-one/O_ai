So what we did for them is something like this the moment I start typing in this cell it starts showing these parts for the left hand side models on the right hand side and top searches US Patriot Tactical apparel a thirty five million dollar company they sell military apparel to citizen but them as a products site brand is more important and some of the categories are more important. The moment I start typing in Ni it starts showing me Nike the most popular brand on the site some of the categories of Nike It show some of the similar brands like Nite ize Night Vision Nine Line Apparel showing some of their categories within these top queries starting with Ni and some of the popular products not just that say the black boots here the fourth black boot became more popular this week and this boot will come on top and others will come down. Express as a brand for them category and some of the subcategories or say some of the popular products within these categories are important for them I think this is much more closer to your site The moment I start typing in jeans starts guiding me to jeans within each of these categories in men in women in slim in blue in gray and it started showing me some of the popular products within each of these categories. May be this week the gray jeans is more popular or the merchandisers decides to promote gray jeans for a particular period I know during Christmas the red jeans was more popular and it used to show the red jeans it starts showing that. Then jeans and women jeans  some of the other categories or query which are popular within jeans will start showing up and then the last thing is big basket dot com on big basket dot com they had two challenges They are I would say the second largest grocery retailer in APAC for them they had they had multiple visitor or say I would say visitors buy multiple products in each grocer they would buy like <> every time they would transact <> products it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search for the product go to the product page add to  cart and then check out instead what we did is something like this the moment I'd start typing in Chi it start showing some of the popular options with the Chili chicken the price the quantity the delivery options allows me to increase the quantity and add to the cart right here from the search box. Some of the commonly search terms for Chi from the popular brand and categories and also starts putting up a banner here for you to start I would say promoting the products for a particular search not just that because they have repeat visitors that we also added personalization meaning if I was buying chili more often on the site I start seeing Chili on top but if you go buying chicken skinless more often you would start seeing chicken skinless on top this helped them reduce their clicks almost 30% from from 80 clicks to now they are somewhere around say I would say 20 25 clicks per transaction and each of these case you would notice every customer of ours had a different challenge that they wanted to solve and different customer behavior on the site<> and how customers buying today on the site.,
