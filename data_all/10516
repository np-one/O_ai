okay so Im assuming that you will be used Google Analytics so I think you might haven't deployed a JavaScript snippet from Google right very similar to that we have a JavaScript snippet and just very simple clicks that we need to track you just need to add simple tags and I'll show you what they look like okay so here's what the JavaScript tag looks like wherever you have your GA tag just copy this as well straightforward the next is just to able to track clicks and this is not something that we have to do right away this is something that does help us figure out user behavior so if you wanted to deploy beyond relevancy clearly relevancy step one but beyond relevancy if you want to deploy user behavior this clickstream data becomes very helpful and it's as simple as just adding the ease HTML tags everywhere there's a click so Add to Cart order and product clicks whether browse or search plate pages and that's it those are the simple three tags that you gotta add okay so that's required no matter what path we take as a foundation and step one point four is again one of my implementation loving people long documents it's we're gonna validate it for you.,
