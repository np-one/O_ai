so you know from that perspective there was a lot of redundancy in the autocomplete so now what this creates obviously is a confusion between the customer to say if I click on shade will I get one results so I have to click on shades what's one so you are confusing the customer and asking them to make a choice number two it's not an obvious choice let's play that way number two yeah you are wasting that space where you could have suggested something else also in sort of the same word twice.,
