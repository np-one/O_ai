and I think one of the huge challenges when this approaches you end up doing so many things manual which ends up taking away a lot of bandwidth from from people fine so what you've tried doing is for all these error Corrections synonym detection we've tried building out-of-the-box solution so that we can actually get things automatically resolved rather than having to go through a fairly manual functional there I'll show you a few examples actually let me just pull this off like if you go to Express like the way this thing is intelligent there is now if you go started were looking for address this is not even available for men in their catalogue so it doesn't even show men is an option but the moment you start change this to dress shirt dress shirt is available for men so men is an option will actually start coming up right and then from a spell check perspective take up three letter word black leather jacket like I can misspell all the three words I can say b-l-c-k-t-e-t-h-j-e-k-e-t so what it will do is it'll essentially auto correct just to black leather jacket and also show you results from the word go.,
