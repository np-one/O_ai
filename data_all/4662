so what I'll do is I send out the support we have prepared for you you can obviously share this internally and let us know and if there are certain customers and you are industry you want you want to quickly talk to just to figure out how their experience has been with us we can arrange for some references as well and then you could let us know what could be a good time period for you guys to probably take this up as a project and I'll also do one thing I'll probably send you some comparison between solar and us essentially what solar gives you by default what is that you could do with solar and what are the challenges of working with solar and how we can help you overcome those challenges so when somebody in IT looks at it POC will probably be going through that day in and day out they can quickly relate to some of the use cases we are talking about and and it's yeah if it makes sense to them if they want us to do a more deep technical call happy to engage with them and talk to them about the back end technology because everyone talks about relevancy and machine learning it's more of a bad word out there but we can probably break it down and help them understand as to what exactly are the use cases we're solving for.,
