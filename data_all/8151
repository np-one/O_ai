Some of the non product search terms right I look for shipping and delivery and I see you have a category or a tab that says shipping and delivery but if as a customer I was trying to search I was trying to type and see I'm looking looking for a for an e-commerce site that can deliver products in say 48 hours right. So out of my I just come onto the site and start looking at your shipping policy and your delivery policy try to type shipping and delivery shipping and delivery this is exactly how it is on your site today then I look for delivery everything returns products doesn't take me to your shipping and delivery page right. Only the word shipping if I was to look for just shipping it does take you to your shipping and delivery page but anything outside of that does not take me there same thing with returns you do have a guaranteed returns page but if I was to search for returns that's not take me anywhere does not show me a return policy and here are few examples in terms of how you can also address some of the nonprofit search and it's not just the shipping and returns policy at times companies also have a lot of content on the site a lot of educational material on the site that their readers come and and read right and then eventually if they like something they end up buying so we can also make that content searchable.,
