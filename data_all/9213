Okay cool then level looked at was error tolerance right on the site and why error tolerances Important and I wanted to put some statistics here so one of the research says that 25% of all search queries are misspelled on shop by shoppers on ecommerce sites is a very common behavior and there could be various reason people type fast people type or come from smaller screens like mobile phones or tablets right and on the right hand side use what what you'll notice is the half data that it we pull up from Express this is a real time data 216 different ways in which jumpsuit was misspelled on their site or 223 different ways that body suit was actually misspelled on their site within a month right. And then for the million ways how alphabet letter can be misspelled on any site but this is something that's that's real data that we were able to pull out from a customer. And it's some of the with some of the traditional search solutions that are out there in the market they the the merchandisers are expected to go look at these reports on a weekly monthly basis and start fixing them. A it's a it's a lot of manual labor to sit and fix these kind of I would say equations of any misspelled queries especially with large catalog sizes and Two every time someone makes a mistake and a new mistake spelling mistake the experience at that point in time is lost right the that particular customer was not able to find the product easy looks here are some examples from your site I try to misspelled say printers without a r Miska ribbons I interchanged C&S to see what what results I would get again zero results then I tried lanyard I typed U instead of Y U being an alphabet right next to Y and I on on the keyboard I quickly first U instead of Y and to see  if it was to autocorrect at start showing me the results but then again zero results page. For that what we have done is built a technology and algorithm that can automatically correct a search query of up to six words the three alphabets misspelled in each word black leather jacket on Express all three words are misspelled with one alphabet missing we not only connected but we also start showing results in real time right here you will see maybe printers what was they were the system was trying to auto correctly to print and not printers but then again it did not show me any products for it right in the other two cases it didn't even autocorrected.,
