One of our focus area has been to give that power to a merchandiser or a marketer A we give them all the insights from our analytics as to what query is working what kind of products are selling well and secondly for a merchandiser give them a very simple UI tool where they can go in and make changes and run campaigns on the fly rather than having to wait for a few days or a week to actually go and create a campaign and I probably will take a few minutes just show you how seamless it is to actually do it.,
