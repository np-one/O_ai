got it so let's say and that's absolutely correct so let's say I am from New York using a mobile device and the system figures have to say using machine learning what other customers might have done that this is the sort order in terms of how we should show them let's say that is the case and the system does figure that out but what now happens is if your merchants are looking at this and saying you know what why don't we from a business perspective want to show these are you my best to performing products but I want to also clear my inventory and I were to show next to product that might be inventory clear or my next two products might also be a new arrival and if I wanted to show it that way you have the ability to override the algorithm automatically because it's not about just trying to say if I'm coming from New York and mobile device and I buy these types of products so everybody will buy the same types of product right.,
