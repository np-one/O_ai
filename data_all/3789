all right so some of what you can do is you can have that number ported on to freshdesk itself so that you know everything you have your customers calling about that number you have that ringing here with freshdesk to where it is even here once you put that number with this it's a simple setup that you could have either it could be a simple message where you could call out upload the welcome message or record it or even convert the text to speech right and that would play to all groups in the system but then when you have various groups what I would actually suggest is have an IVR base set up way based on the key press you can direct these calls coming in to specific groups in the system or input also be specific agents in these groups right so once you have this set up it's going to be as simple as wait you know you accept the calls either wire the browser but in case they could be cases where you know if some of your agents are on the field it could definitely also say they would like to receive it by a phone in that way all the calls would be directed to their handsets all right so there are the two ways in which you could receive these calls and with respect to the call itself you can yeah you know you have the feasibility to record these calls you get you know set up the maximum together and of course if there are there is a situation where in case none of the none of them are available to take these calls you could have it you know directed to a voicemail and that would automatically convert into a ticket.,
