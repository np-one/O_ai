so another thing that we do again from the UI perspective is there might be multiple reasons why I like the specific guide if I want to see similar products will probably help you alternate product discovery instead of taking you to a new page or a new window what it does is actually infants of a module window where I can look for products select a specific product in one with as I told all that solutions are built to be responsive on a mobile app as well this is like a system more like this often is how it works mobile phone and we believe a mobile autosuggest should be even more effective because people who have tendency to make more spelling mistakes on a mobile device because it's a smaller screen smaller keypad people have 5 stubby fingers and the categories hoping that has to be built effectively for a mobile device is much much different than a laptop,
