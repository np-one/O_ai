here so in it perfect so in that way what I would strongly suggest to you guys is to go about creating radius groups from the system and add these agents against these specific groups so that you know if you have these tickets coming in you could also be you can view them based on the groups that you have so on the team so that you know if maybe someone from let's say your sales team would like to view what's happening with the technical support you can have these various view set up so that they could toggle between these videos views and see which are these tickets that have come in to those respective groups.,
