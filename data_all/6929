I'll do I did see is for some of the broader based product searches there are probably some rules built in so the relevancy is much higher but as it goes to a long tail the relevancy comes little over I'm not sure if you observe this or I'll find out and we've tried solving it when you go very specific to a specific feature like on in apparel where people can go very specific where they can ask look for say a full sleeve office where for women or a black v-neck for the money the intent is how do you understand the context of what the user is looking for likw how does women rank how does full sleeve right how does office where ranked as tokens and how do you pull up the right product accordingly is what we try doing differently and display the right results any questions so far.,
