Oh I see okay so like the Internal search okay yeah we run on a Magento platform but we are launching a new site very soon and we're incorporating Binx search engine third party so that that should help clean it clear up the searches right now we have to sort of manually manipulate a lot of the data to give a suggested search this should give a better indication for whatever variables there may be in those search queries no but yeah I mean otherwise just breaking it down by it by segments by market segments by category that's kind of how we're doing it now to try to get them to what they're looking for.,
