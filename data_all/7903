Yeah and especially what what it is is I brand marketing I've been a CMO CEO and CTO um and so I was I went to Walgreens through an acquisition and um and I told him I was resigning and just going to do consulting and they told me no you can work from home run run these programs and then one of the things that I do is I help them to evaluate platform vendors so anytime someone calls into Walgreens and says they've got a marketing or a technology solution and then sure you know who would be the right team to evaluate it it comes to my Inbox.,
