for you that has more history on on a deal and all that but I work in a simple thing an advisory group within Cerberus they're not the guys that are off making the fields but the point of difference is silly to advise the portfolio companies that we invest in to hopefully add some value be there as someone that's kind of placed in to a portfolio company or someone that should kind of bear on an advisement basis so that is my engagement currently with Avon and I'm assisting a couple others in a lot of marketing and sales and strategy projects that are ongoing and I've been spending a lot of time there there's some background noise that you or me.,
