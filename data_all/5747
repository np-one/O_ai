so what now needs to happen is let's say even if I when I do the grand search and I come in and say I want to search for gold plates if I misspell gold plates will take ten seconds to find out what it actually comes back with and it says did you mean gold plate and it starts showing these results it's forks and knives it just shows some gold plates but essentially starts with some forks and knives and spoons even though it thinks that gold plate was the word that I was looking for okay that is something that Unboxd also resolves today any other system that you might go to to resolve that you will have to create synonyms on the back end manually you'll have to come in and say plates is equal to plate this misspelling of plate is equal to the correct of plate and every permutation and combination you do not have to do that with Unboxd and box automates these problems and solve them through our system so if I were to and we've actually solved it for almost 6 different keywords being misspelled in a single query so if I was misspelling black leather jacket every will autocorrect black leather jacket and start showing results for black leather jacket .,
