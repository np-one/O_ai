So today if you go to their site and if I start typing in say ni where I probably mean Nike what you would see is one on one side you have category scope where it says okay it could be Nike. And these are probably the top three categories in Nike based on the user behaviour on the site but will also tell you as a user there is also something called as Nite glow gear and Nine line apparel which users might have generally not known at all. Plus there is a recommendation widget for all the top queries for something starting with ni plus there is a visual tour of all the popular products that's available on the site right. Third example I will give you is a grocery site the reason I give you this example is the there might be multiple use cases where people buy in more than three or four products in a single transaction on your site.,
