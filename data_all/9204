This is how their site search used to look like earlier right there two different search boxes One was to search by part and the other one was to search by model because there are two kinds of visitors on this site one would search by part in one would search my model how we came in and said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so they're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box and what did they choose the wrong search box altogether right. So we not only built the the product finder for them but what we also did is combined both the search bars and build something like this right . The moment I start typing in bissel on the left hand side I start seeing all the Bissell parts on the right hand side or on the models for the bissel and some of the top searches for bissel.,
