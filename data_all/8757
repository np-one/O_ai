Here is what typically sites see in terms of the query types from a home furnishing site the product type still remains on top and then comes the feature type search and then. So how do we map the search queries right say someone looking for a Nike black field Boots right typically traditionally all the search systems the way they would work is they would start to go and find Nike black field and boots all four words in your product catalog tightly or the other attributes which could be description all that is thing that's the attribute set the product that's right in that case what happens is they then they start doing or-ing or anding meaning everywhere they find these words they start showing all of those results or they they limited by ending it Nike and black and field and boots right. Those are the traditional way of doing  search  this kind of limits the results or shows a lot of irrelevant results but with us what we've built is a contextual aware system which is able to understand that within the query field boots is more of a product type I would say Tom right black is is the color attribute and Nike is the brand attribute and based on that we start showing the results accordingly not just that so you have 100 black boots or say Nike black boots I know based on the user behavior we also start changing the order of these products based on the popularity right what is it that people are clicking more and buying more often those kind of products start coming on top of the fold in real time by and then this is done by the user per click right analytics is being gathered and being processed in the immediate next action by the same user or any other user any any questions.,
