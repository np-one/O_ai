yeah I appreciate that and I think that what we've been doing is it at least you what you said brought up more over desire for us to understand our requirements needs compared against the features on offer so well you didn't you definitely spurred us to action on that you didn't lead us down any specific path choice hey different thunder so don't feel like we said alright well now because mom dude invest in Magento right away that's not the case it's more of understanding which platform is best for us and I think we've been so familiar with Shopify that we didn't give the other ones a fair share of evaluation.,
