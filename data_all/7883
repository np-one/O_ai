So we added the Geo segment there and then we showed the popular products and as you hover around these products change right and we made a change in real time as well because now if you actually look for dress as a query Express does not have dress for men so Men as an option will not even show up right but the moment I look for dress shirt then you'll actually see options for men because dress shirts are available for Men right Some bit of customizations we've tried right but if you go to say a retailer like SS396 who actually sell auto parts for them it's important for you for a customer to drill down to a specific model of a car that that you actually want to buy a part for right So now if I go and search for mirror on that site the first navigation boxes would actually for me to identify which car model I'm actually looking for and then it actually shows me products available and since they actually have a grocery kind of behavior where people might not come to this site to just buy one part but usually they buy anywhere between four to six products in a transaction they wanted an option where you can actually change quantity and add products to cart from the search box itself so we built a functionality like that right.,
