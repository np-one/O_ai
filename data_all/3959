Okay so and then what I want to do is now take you through elements of site search and before we do that what I want to do is give you a quick example. Live example of what we've done with some of our customer examples right so we believe that when you talk about site search it's very important to have four key elements. The first key element does the autocomplete itself because in autocomplete if you look at your site today right if I start typing in say anything it could be something like laptop right. I know it's in a different language but primarily what should happen is the autocomplete experience should be visual and guided.,
