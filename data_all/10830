so is that something where it's only possible to populate that menu on your search results pages or we able to just have that across our pre-existing category pages because my my only concern is that we currently use search results to power some of our other by price searches by colour and a few others.  and I sort of a workaround and I don't know if we're gonna be fixing anytime soon but it's it's something where I would like to know if we could have this on top of our existing category pages so not just for a search result page but.  she's just saying can we use your left nav and apply it to all of our pages.,
