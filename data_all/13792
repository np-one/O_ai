I'll give you a simple example let's say let's say you have thousand black chairs in your catalogue and ten white shoes okay thousand black chairs and ten white shoes what happens if I search for white chairs you don't have any but the system will interpret that and say the word white shows up ten times out of a thousand and ten times versus chairs shows up a thousand times out of a thousand and ten times so why it gets pretty rare which means it must be more important so I'm going to show products they contain the word white in it and it ends up showing white shoes now while you don't have any white chairs you still want to show black chairs but not white shoes . and that is the first problem that Unbxd solves.,
