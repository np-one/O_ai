From looking at group by they have their service is kind of an all-in-one where you pay and you get merchandising and the search and whereas bloom reach is more of a split service and reflection is reflection seems to be like the most like complicated platform because it it has really in dept personalization and it is a lot of off-site data so if someone you know looking on Amazon or doing a google search around for a dog for instance before you get to their website reflection the platform is going to know that it can customize the home page specifically for for what you're looking for you get to Petco and you automatically see dog products you're not seeing hamster so that's kind of a cool feature and other than that there's a lot of similarities and I think you know in terms of working with the dashboard adapting to rules one of the things they did on a side note another thing I did see with Unbxd that's that's more interesting to me is that out of the box there is no rule that you have set up for stemming and for the spelling or plural or anything like that so but yeah I think that we're really interested and testing it out for ourselves if that's possible and just so we can have a play like you know this you only have an hour or so to do a demo and you might not know all the questions that you need to ask or you might not know what you don't know the that that's kind of why we're we're aiming to get a staging environment set up with with these tools.,
