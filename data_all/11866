so we do have a plugin for Magento's through which we can directly pull your product catalog as well as integrate our recommendations for switch the best way that we are generally suggests to everyone is to go through the hosted search implementation wherein we can actually host the search page at our end without really touching anything within your Magento just to ensure that there are no no conflicts with any of your other third parties and whenever you make changes you don't have to come back to us to actually help with that so what we do is we actually come up with our own search page which looks exactly the same way as your current search page does and except for the fact that it would be hosted at our end and the only thing that changes is that you have to create a sub domain at your end and read out back to unboxd so for the end user it's still gonna be the same lostgolfball dot com but internally the page would actually be hosted at the unboxd so this is so fastest way of implementation and ensure that you know with all the customizations that keep happening in Magento this install that none of those get changed the unboxing presentation and in fact even the unboxers are not stopped working just because someone your team goes here that makes in other changes in Magento so this is our recommended way for implementation so it's the most an implementation let me just yeah that approach fine for the implementation.,
