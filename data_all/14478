No I think I'm following you I'm I'm just done trying to see how that fits to what you know what you're doing fits so complex to what I'm doing then it probably does with my search customers are looking at it differently than what say you're buying a pair of shoes now they already know that they need Viking shoes because that's the kind of shoes that they currently have and a lot of it's a matter of it isn't getting so much directed from all the multitude of options as it is getting directed based on what they know they need to have so if you have a if you have a Scott album um you know that already well you don't need to look at all of the multitude of others you just need to find the Scott one and that's my challenge is get them to the Scott one before they give up that make sense.,
