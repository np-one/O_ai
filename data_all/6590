Okay alright so step three is now that we've got the search results from top down and bottom up cleaning up that piece we now look at the analytics so because we deploy analytics along with our search solution we track every single click that the customer makes whether they click on the search results click on the product filters sorting pagination etc and we come up with a and this is again tracking per search query okay not a site-wide statistics just gets rolled up this is tracked per query and we try to figure out within the search results that now we have which is your start product and the start product could be based on performance in terms of conversion number of clicks by orders add to carts etc and then we reorder the results by showing your best performing product up top okay and number four is your merchandising so we will take an example of say boosting for example normally what happens even and this happens again in solar or idf based solutions where your search results for a particular query are usually unnormalized idf so let's say for example I have this first shoe which the score of that is two point one six I want to boost that and want to show that at top so normally I'll boost using ten points but sometimes that's not enough in this case is example so I'll boost it by say a hundred points just to make sure that it shows up at top the problem is because this shoe gets boosted so much that when it's leastly relevant in some other query even in that query this product will start to show up at top so this is another problem that Unbxd has solved by normalizing the idf so now if I wanted to boost this particular shoe I don't mostly to use random numbers I use relative percentages to boost so I can say if I want to show up at top I can boost it by 20% 50% if I want to show it up in the middle I made sure it by 20% if I want to bury it I can show it as 0% it will get buried at the bottom okay and here's a sort of a collection of all the different elements if you want to compare Unbxd solution to any open-source architecture like solar or elastic search so what you get with solar or elastic search is the middle brown box out of the box that's it but to get a good or a great search solution you need all the blue boxes around it as well and that is what Unbxd has done so starting from the top left we need to have an e-commerce context-aware solution so it actually can figure out that a woman's white jeans is a jeans and not a white top and then you have automated stemming spell check a synonym corpus to allow for a particular jargon in the industry bleeds into the autocomplete where you wants the system to guide the customer not necessarily just show categories or or keywords up top next in the top top-left corner sorry is the user behavior the dynamic faceting and I'll show you some of these examples and these personalized recommendations as well and then you have the infrastructure that scales automatically depending on what your traffic is and starts to use the real-time data to personalize and start personalizing the search results and last is the merchandising to apply the business rules so if you have inventory clearance if you have sale if you have new product launches and promotions or you might have partnerships with vendors that you might want to give preferential treatment you might have these merchandising requirements landing page requirements banners that you want to show and above all reporting in terms of what is it that after all these hard work did the analytics analytics say that you provided us conversionsright so this complete system is what makes up a good search solution Any other questions gentleman.,
