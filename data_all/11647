And see the primary reason we do this is because I can go on about this for the next two hours but the point is this is not any theoretical thing right. What works for another customer might not work for you right so the best way to do it is what we have done is we've reduced that implementation time drastically. So that we can come and show value integrated it in like one to two weeks and quickly start showing value if you see the value you continue if you don't see the value you might as well be better off doing it yourself. So we want to make that impact and that's why we want to make it easy for you to test it out and then see if it makes an impact or make sense to you or not.,
