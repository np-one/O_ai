yeah yeah so there are two ways of doing this either you can just give us the admin access and we can take care of installing our module directly from the store or in otherwise you can just directly go to the Shopify app store and search for unboxed and just get our module installed from there the unbox recommendations module and during the installation of that there will be a couple of questions about selecting a plan and all of that I can send an all these steps to you so that it's a lot easier for you to fall of them and once you've selected the right plan you're just taken to the different set of steps the first one being the integration of the analytics on your site so this is for tracking the clicks cards the orders for the recommendations as such and this just involves including specific snippets and our module itself will directly go directly you know from our dashboard and what are some of these elements that need to be added on the specific places within Shopify so it's a self you know sustainable model out here where you can actually go through each of these steps and you will be shown what others different steps or analytics information for recommendations and all of these so let me just walk it through how each of these look like so for example this is what needs to be added for the recommended for you so let me just show you the analytics integration first so yeah these are the kind of snippets that you need to add on all the pages the JavaScript codes and then we have these simple div tag placements for the clicks add to cards and the orders so all you need to do is add these at the right places and the module when you install the module it will just take you through each one of these steps automatically one after the other and it will validate for you whether whatever you can enter it is tracking things correctly or not so all of that will be taken care of on its own so talents for the analytics integration and then we of course have the recommendations part as well so then you can choose you know which widget needs to go on which of these pages so you can just all you need to do is paste the snippets on the index dot liquid for the specific page location that you want to add this one because some of these you would want to add on the home page like your home page top sellers there'll be some of those which you'd want to add on the product description pages like the more like these and the viewed also viewed so it's a pretty straightforward thing and you can get down in you know two to three hours to actually get the recommendations up and running one on your site so if there's a specific design you have in your mind I can get my team to do this integration as well and this is how simple it is to get the recommendations up and running there's nothing to it so let me know if you have any questions on the recommendations.,
