Okay perfect so before we get into our solution what we wanted to establish was where is the opportunity so we did a little bit of analysis on your site tried to come up with what is it that we feel is the right opportunity and as Allen mentioned based on your conversation Conor with him what are the some of the challenges that you guys face today and if you start looking at the first interaction a customer has with site search probably with the type-ahead or the autocomplete or autosuggest as you might want to call it right so we were looking at I was looking for some chair covers on the site like your dog chair covers or cat chair covers etc and as soon as I start to type in say chair as you can see in the autocomplete it only categories come up it's missing that guidance that autocompletes must provide to the customers so the function of autocomplete is to guide the customer specifically to where they might want to go so maybe by the categories you are trying to guide them to a category but it does not provide any popular keywords or a quick way to get them somewhere and and you can see these are just two examples but not corner cases and am sure you guys are already aware say for example if I was looking for cat food one of the most biggest categories that you probably have both in store and probably online cat food is nowhere to be as a suggestion so if I was trying to get to one place very quickly the autosuggest has a lot of challenges today second was the relevancy so let's say somehow I figure out the autocomplete and I started typing in say you know fish tank filters and if I started to look for fish tank filters a lot of the suggestions as you can see here in the screenshot are actually fish tanks and maybe if I scroll down below or in a couple of page a couple of pages into the search results I might find those fish tank filters but the problem is and your statistics might slightly vary what we've seen is that 45% of the customers don't bother scrolling down and ninety percent of the customers don't bother going to the second page they are so especially the search customers because they're so used to the whole Google and Amazon world of experiencing search results very quickly that's what the stats really tell it so it's very important to make sure that the first four of results shows very accurate search results okay another example dog car seat cover little bit complicated multi keyword query and as you can see it's basically showing some travel rack and car seats instead of actually car seat covers non product searches if I search for returns it redirects me to the returns page or but if I search for returns policy it gives me zero results or shipping policy does not bring any results same thing with spellcheck if I search for bedding or collars as you can see here are some of the suggestions in first example the bedding it didn't have any auto correction but in collars it actually tried to figure out a collar with a period and then it provides did you mean colors or maybe collars color colored with a comma etc so there seems to be a lot of text pattern matching that seems to be going in which is very typical of solar to do that let's say if we tried to do multi word spell check like I talked look for a dog kennel and you can see here the keyword suggestions is dog keep but also here are some other ones with dog kennel but it doesn't seem to pick up using machine learning that maybe dog kennel is the right thing that the customer was probably looking for some other examples stemming if I search for say guinea pig on the left it redirects me to a small animal category page but if I search for guinea pigs I actually now start getting results last but not the least maybe second last but not least quickly on the filters so if I let's say I searched for dog kennel as a query you can see that the cat filters on the search results are what I see on the left so I might see category brand or price and then some vegetarian or grain-free now this might be depending on how the query had returned certain relevant to non-relevant results but we know that if I go to the category page the filters on the right are probably more appropriate for that type of search query and we'll show you exactly how Unbxd is able to solve this sort of problem at scale okay and the last piece is the performance of search so we ran a quick multi-region test on the search results page and we saw that two different tests that we ran and pretty much the response times are very very long in to multi seconds and as you guys probably know Google has published a standard to say that search results should be around 300 milliseconds because anything less than that a human eye cannot detect but anything slower than that and you can start seeing search exit rates to go up so what let's define what the opportunity really it is it's not it's just a query problem right it's not solving one query at a time and Petco has thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of queries and you cannot physically fix individual queries so you need a better relevance technology clearly second is you also need a system that understands the business because a lot of times the queries the products might be very overlapping but there's still several differences into whats the products are and so you want a system that actually understands your business and the third is you also need a better site search framework so today you might have your categories that you sell today but you might add new categories in the future and how should those new categories be structured that's where the search site-search framework comes into play and guess what Unbxd does all three we provide a technology where we've solved a lot of site search problems that provides a sort of a foundation to scale second is business like we mentioned we don't give you a copy/paste solution that every other retailer gets we try to understand your business and we try to figure out what type of solution what type of user experience is required for your business and third is you also give you a framework we come up with a playbook that both strategically and tactically and collaboratively obviously allows us to solve some challenges that you might encounter in the future Any questions gentlemen before I rapped in too many things in front of you guys I just want to take a pause and see if you guys have any questions.,
