you have already have issues as the results of customisation that are already gotten a bit out of hand so anything I can do to sort of limit additional conflicts or you know overwrites from the Magento site would be good and I guess I'm willing to try the subdomain as the first effort provided you know the customers really don't see any impact there that it wouldn't affect our you know SEO or search is at all I mean meaning you know what Google is seeing but other than that it I mean it seems like a reasonable way to do it I guess you still have to install a connector of some sort.,
