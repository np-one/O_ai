what we tried doing here was to try and mimic the customer behavior as to what he or she would go through when they try and discover product on your site and we've taken the entire journey  right from the search interaction to the search box like you start showing up suggestions is it visual is it guided does it really help in making the impact on the customer in their search interactions and then we look at the error provisions in the site in terms of how do you manage the spellings how do you manage the synonyms and then finally we look at core elements of relevancy right here we do we've taken 3 4  different snapshots just to give you a perspective where we think the opportunity is and just to set some context one of the key things why unboxing __ so far is a lot of customers a lot of search partners whom I've interacted with talk a lot about machine learning but in that technically become a fat word today but what we essentially do is we do something called as contextual relevance where most of the search systems have been built on the principles of a document search engine we've tried to build a very very pure plate product high product search where our system today our AI platform actually understands product and the context in which those products are searched for which is why while I take you through some live examples you'll see that even for long tail queries queries with more than 2  to 3 words partial SKU searches you will still find the most relevant results with which we've built on these systems.,
