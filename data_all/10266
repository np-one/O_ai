I'll show you some more examples right again this isn't apparel but the reason I showed you this example is because it's so specific I'm specifically looking for a full sleeves office wear for women so (a) should get into a category then its should looking for a specific theme and then it's looking for a specific product but it still shows up the right results so that's simply what I want to show you here and then we also solve for part number matches pretty well you don't have to have the exact part number mentioned even a partial part number will give you options and while you're actually typing the part number it will actually start showing you options in an auto suggests functionality itself so that you really don't have to go through a complete search experience to find the product.,
