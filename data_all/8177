Black leather jacket all three misspelled there is actually one alphabet missing in all three words off of the query we immediately autocorrect It and start showing the results without waiting for the customer to click onto something and 85 to 90% of your misspelled queries will automatically be corrected now at times the pushback that you might get from your development team is that they would come back and say oh we can look at the reports we can identify what are being misspelled most often and we can correct them but forgetting that say a 7 alphabet word can be misspelled in a million ways A B when a customer comes misspells doesn't see results leave the site right that experience from that customer is lost right you wait for one week for 100 such customers to have a bad experience then run a report and start building redirects or correcting them and it's too late so it needs to be automated that you do not need manual resources or running reports to understand these challenges and start correcting. Same thing with stemming write the knob overseas knobs of plural my intent again doesn't change I am primarily looking for knobs for not you show me some knobs here which is okay but but for knobs with an S doesn't written any knob just one product some sort of drill guide but not other.

I looked at your site looks like crosses more than 200 percent either is over 200 % over first some of the path right for not central typically very smooth faster on the western side of the gumption line so this is another thing that you would want to look at in terms of improving the experience of the customer here is something that we tested with Express this was this was on Black Friday I would say the heavy traffic day the most busy day of the year and you'll see all all four regions remain within the 300 milli second industry standard.,
