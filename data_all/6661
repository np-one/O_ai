Got it so I have two approaches to do the search results integration one is called we call the Ajax template or second is the backend connector so on the Ajax template it's pretty straightforward you could give us a page you do the header you do the footer and put our Ajax scripts and we'll print the entire search results in the middle so let's say for example I'll just do a quick search here let's say dog kennel so let's say this was assume this is a search results and everything from here to here until this banner is your header so you print that page everything below here to here is your footer you print that page everything in the middle an Ajax Script can come in and display the results and will display the results exactly what your UI shows today exactly the way it does today the colors the fonts the style etc so that's one approach the second approach is using the back end where what we do is within your WCS there's a configuration file called WC search dot XML what you do is you create a Unbxd profile and specifically make a call instead to your your solar you make an API call to Unbxd and our responses will be exactly like your solar responses so we've modified our responses to mimic your solar responses so application doesn't know any difference and basically you get the search results and then you basic and you take those search results and you apply all the rules that you normally apply to your search results from solar and display it on the website let's say you have any filtering that you apply any facets that you want to hide or not show all of that you can apply and then straight inside.,
