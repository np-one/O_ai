I don't know if it simplifies our need is that most people who come in have a pretty good if they're going to search for something they have a pretty good idea of what they're looking for we have a lot of people who come in from another place as they've searched at Google or they've come in from another third-party site whether they're coming and looking for a particular yarn and maybe even a particular colour and so then once they they get there they might then they start you know bouncing around looking at other stuff probably one of the biggest changes that we would like to see implemented would be that when someone could search for something that was a little bit more general which is probably what you know we would expect to happen behaviour wise on on a search would be that they we would have a results page that looked more like a collection of photographs as opposed to a list of text responses.,
