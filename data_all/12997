yeah this gives me perfect timing because we've added so many things over the holiday period because we have it down delivered on time in terms of integrations so I want to make sure that don't get added and also look pretty so not just engineering language so thank you for that for the end of this week I'll send that to you and if you if you want us to schedule one more demo call for your bigger team John don't hesitate to say so I love to do these demos I love to have these types of conversations so I'm more than happy to do that as well and I can very quickly walk them through within 30 minutes exactly what we're going to do and what's gonna look like so they can also see if you want them to see firsthand what this will look like rather than taking a whole hour I can do that also as an offer if you need to .,
