So yeah so in grocery the specific use case they had was one they had customers who'd buy a lot of products in a single transaction. So they wanted a simpler way to add products to cart which could be a case in business case in your case as well where someone might come in and buy a grip and a thumb stick in the same transaction. And they wanted the section to be completely personalized because if you look at the grocery world I'll probably go and buy say milk egg and a chicken every single week. How can you personalize the entire autocomplete experience for me in a very personalized way so that I buy faster and I feel good about buying on your site right. So here if I go and say start typing in chicken what you would notice is we've given an option to change quantity and all add products to the cart right from the search box. We also display up a banner on their site we also show them all the commonly searched terms we show them all the popular brands and the categories of chicken.,
