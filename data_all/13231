all right so the first things first is the auto suggests the type of head that you see when someone starts typing in anything on the search box so let me just give you an example of the different layouts that we have on our end just to give you a better idea of how the slope so we can do a lot of different layouts we can do a two box autosuggest we can do a single box autosuggest way it's shown here things that you see here now the first one here is something we call the guided search so hasn't how even start typing in something he starts segmenting the data based on any of these specific categories subcategories or brands and we start showing those there and then we have the popular product section so this is driven through the unboxed analytics system so we start tracking what products are being kicked on added to cart and ordered on your side we through search pages all through the category pages and based on all of this information we start showing in the corresponding popular products for any of the queries that that are being typed in so that's on the popular products and then we have the top query second so this is again coming in through the analytics aggregated data where in real time we start capturing what the users have been typing on the site and they show this and all of that especially what's really trending as different keyword suggestions on the site apart from this we can also set some of these suggestions from the back end based on the different fields for example it could just be a color plus category combination or a gender plus a category called configuration and so on so all of that can be handled from the back end can be configured from the back end so a lot of different ways of doing this anything you like in put it in any specific way out or you want me to send these over to you you can take your time and give me a quick.,
