so this is on the feed and the analytics integration apart from this just so you know you know whenever we are walking on this they'll also be requiring a history of your top search queries just so you know it helps us in determining how our search is going to work some of the search configurations and so on but that's for latest yet you know once you have the catalogue with us just so you know that those could be some of the details that you require during the course of this project just so we have all information to find you in the search relevancy now the next piece that I want to discuss is the approaches of implementation because after we the catalog we have the analytics integrated it's just about you know who will be doing this implementation will it be something back-end being done by your team or it will it be something done yes so in couple of ways in which you know most of the effort is on the unboxed end is by either following a hosted search approach where in the search which is actually hosted on the unbox servers and you are doing a redirect to a sub-domain which internally is being in fact redirected onto the unbox levels so one way could be that but this way the page is posted on our end the implementing is fast the results load a lot faster so all of that is taken care of inherently because it's a hosted search approach and most of the m-word is required on our end and the only changes you have to do on your end would be you know adding an auto suggest script the JavaScript that will give you and you know changing the form submit action on the search bar so that it redirects to this specific sub domain which is internally having a cname entry for the unboxed hosted page.,
