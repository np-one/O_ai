okay so these are the different pricing we have and you know I think so if you want I think the blossom if you're going to be just using the phone channel especially if you're just ticketing you know you could just stick with the blossom plan but if you also want since you want the outbound callers to be also dynamically notified so you need dynamic email notifications as available in garden so I mean I would you know leave that up to you it so if it's gonna be automated so either blossom again I really don't see a you know any usage of you know estate or forest.,
