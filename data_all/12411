I also give you an idea from an infrastructure standpoint in a scale newegg dot 
 com has just a shy of a hundred million products in their catalog and we run their search and target on the other side of the spectrum has few fewer products obviously not 100 million but they have 300 million searches happening a month and we also power their search so and you also work with a lot of pure online brands and we also work with a lot of platforms essentially making our solution platform agnostic you know and I can show you very quickly what that looks like so what are the three differentiators that unbox brings to the table one is technology we've solved some of the site search problems that were not solved before I'll show you those what those are business next is you actually customize our solution to fit your business needs and why customers buy from you and the third one is framework so one of the things that your <> told me that you're going from maybe three million active products to maybe say eight million in the next two or three years so new problems will come up when you have scale issues when you have relevancy issues or you start some specific categories that you may not have sold before the ide  a is that new problems may come up and a year from now six months from now so we also bring that aspect to the table they're going to bring a playbook that strategically and tactically helps you solve solve those challenges so how does our technology actually work so very quickly to give you an idea for every single query we do four distinct things were meant semantic relevance exclusion behavior learning and merchandising and when I say every single query what I mean is if I'm searching for a book versus books that's still the same query to us but if I'm looking for Malcolm Gladwell book versus just books those are two different queries to us okay so for each query what we try to do is these four things now what's it are the semantic relevance mean is that you have three techniques and aquitted techniques that are available to get boring ending and minimum match and I'm sure you you are aware of those and these each of these techniques create unique problems in terms of how relevancy works or doesn't work so sometimes with single word queries it might be okay but for multi word queries relevancy really gets screwed up just because of the way the technique might have been applied and the reason for that is that every search engine out there today uses the same technology called tf-idf that was developed in the 1970s so let's say if I looked at women's white jeans and I know it's not so vertical but just bear with me for this example women's why jeans why do I get a white top which is the typical occurrence that will happen when relevancy does not work either I get some bad results or totally bad results and the reason is the underlying algorithm tf-idf which is termed frequency or inverse document frequency only gives you popularity or where you score so a similar example let's say you had a very small catalogue Dan say a thousand white sofas and 10 black chairs okay so to give you an idea if your thousand white sofas and 10 black chairs and if I search for a black sofas what tf-idf will look at it and say black only comes up exist 10 times out of 1000 and 10 times where's the sofa exists thousand times out of 1000 and 10 times what will now happen is that tf-idf will think that black is more important so it will show all the products that has the word black in it so ultimately we end up showing black chairs and that's not necessarily the intent the intent is that sofa is a more important keyword even though you don't have black sofas you still want to show sofas so that's the problem first problem that unbox halls by creating another layer on top of ideas called elements game so we actually identify which keyword is more important as it relates to the other keywords in the query and then show the results based on that so now.,
