We do the coding at the back end all the work that you have to do is only once we actually put it on your QA environment you test it out whether it makes to you. And then you put it live because all these intelligent things the machine will learn itself that the day you start integrating we'll put a tracker on your system. So that the Machine starts understanding as to what is the behaviour on your site and it'll start making intelligent decisions itself so there's very little effort required from your side.,
