and so the idea it's not necessarily by the way guys I want to make sure I say this I forgot to say shoes this is not a criticism of your existing implementation just to create to establish an a a parity that we both understand there is an opportunity at the end of this there isn't I completely understand but please don't take it just take this wrong and the idea here is when a customer is starting to search in the type-ahead you want to do three distinct elements one is you want to make sure you control the journey that the customer is going through by making it easy for them to the queries which you're doing in a way second you also want to guide them because you have so many categories and sub-categories this is not guiding the customer to a particular subset and the third thing is you also want to expose them to products that they never would have thought you also carry so there's that discoverability aspect also that type-ahead needs to accomplish which is where the opportunity exists some other example and this is where I wanted to share this with you I started to search the Nike and there's obviously tons of different categories of Nike products and you can see here it's showing Nike as a keyword but it's also showing some custom landing pages that you guys might have created using solar like a October 10th promotion for Nike or an October 15 promotion correctly I'm not sure what those dates are I'm assuming that's what those are same thing with if I'm starting to look for rain I'm starting to type in rain there's a tons of different sets of products not just jackets and coats and pants but there's accessories that are related to rain gear that you also want to expose the customer to and same thing here if I'm looking for fire related products there's a lot of different elements so the type-ahead is an opportunity to accomplish something like that the second thing I wanted to also identify is how the type-ahead behaves with different sets of keywords in different for the same keyword in different stages that it's in so I just typed in ste so I'm starting to type in Steel Toe right so it gives me an idea on Steel Toe with two E's it stays there but as soon as I type in steel start showing new products but for ste and stee it has it was showing me no popular products even though obviously there are related products to steel and then I started to type in Steel Toe and certainly the only product that shows up is this t-shirt okay.,
