well the idea is nothing that we do see on your old site right given we are starting it on in August in new siteand still do the POC on the old site and which is a which is a good 90 120 days off period for us to implement and for me to test for the for the 30 to 60 days period and then make a decision whether this is a this is a technology want to continue with on your new site and for any reason if you don't like us and you know that on the new site you might want to go with someone else or you might want to continue with us so that's that's very typical admin model for customers who are in a in a platform change phase I would say.,
