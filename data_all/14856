Okay perfect so just a quick recap I run sales here and one of our product evangelists here on the west coast so I manage a lot of the accounts from LA and Oregon and up to Colorado.  So I'm doing a lot of that travelling around so I appreciate the time that not only have to booth but here today and I know at the booth we went over via mobile in terms of how that is optimized for your site so what I did today though was took a look at you were a desktop site.  And went through that to kind of see you know where we can see some some levels of improvement not any type of you know,
