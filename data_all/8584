And you cannot manually it's not possible to manually kind of solve relevancy at that scale and what we have Found is that there are based on any query that you see from a customer you can group them into one of these twelve segments or query types it is what we call them and we've done a high level grouping or a spectrum qualifiers and structure now what that means is spectrum is are you looking for a very specific product or a type of product or you don't know what product to look for but you have a condition or a symptom that you need to solve or you're not even looking for a product right you're looking for like shipping policy or exchange policy etc. Qualifiers are I'm looking for a product but I have some qualifiers around it I'm looking for a six-feet cable or I'm looking for a six feet HDMI cables cetera and then linguistic shortcuts is what is our query structure is how do you actually structure the words of the query so I could write six feet HDMI cable as six single quote or or six feet FT or six Feet right and you need to be able to understand all those different parameters and and various ways it's how somebody would might search. So starting with that aspect of it from the search relevance perspective we wanted to get into it and see you know let's say a query type you have is a Belden cable and obviously the search results that are being shown today show a lot of the categories around it and maybe maybe this is a way for you to help customer to narrow down a specific category but we believe that when we look at an non search aspect you know the results that you actually see are already there right through the catalog through the navigation menus.,
