so I'm not sure what the theory behind this you may also like is there something this is a cross sell widget but you have to think about a customer could be in two different states of mind in on this particular page either they really like this product and they want to buy this in that case how do we come show them some complementary products which is this backpack or this top may be doing but you're right now we were just mixing it in and giving them mixed signals because trying to accommodate for two states of minds right now the second state of mind would be I'm not convinced I'm gonna buy this product I'm just evaluating so if I'm evaluating the only way for me to move forward in my journey is to either pick one of the two options that you've given me or to go back to the page that I was whether it was a navigation category page result or a search result crate and what Unboxd has found is that giving distinct options to make it very clear to the customer what path they can take from here on makes it for a best next step for the customer and what I mean by that is if you want to show for a customer who is absolutely convinced they want to buy this cross selling products show them a vision that says cross selling products you may also like these other products that are complementary to what you're looking at if this customer is in a state of mind where they are not sure um how to buy this product give them more options to give them the ability to evaluate alternatives and you do that by separating both widgets into two I mean separating both solutions to two different distinct widgets and that is what we have found and pretty sure everyone has their opinion but that's the one thing that I would say now this is just on the product detail page we also have on the navigation page let's say again now the question comes up is well we want to show most popular because it's data driven which is obviously one a train of thought the merchant may come in and say you know what we have to apply some merchandising rules to show certain product on top and because they have their gut feeling they have their experience and how do we combine both of them well the way we combine is we show category top sellers so we can have a widget right here as the first row that shows category top sellers which can be scrolled horizontally and the rest of the products that now show up are merchandise or are based on a merchandising rule that the marketing of the merchandising team decides okay so you can do category top sellers we can do homepage top sellers we also do cart recommendations and I'm assuming you guys probably know that have that as well so let's say by the way any of these pop-ups once the once you have confirmed that they're of adage card that pop up also can have other recommendations because that's a very strong signal right it's a very strong signal that the customer really likes that product and the state of mind a they're in so now it's pretty clear that we don't need to show them more alternatives you probably want to might want to show a comparable or not compound I'm sorry compatible other accessories or other products that are complementary to that product which is I believe what you're showing here but what if they had clicked on checkout and not come to this page so there's that missed opportunity to show that as well and I'm sure.,
