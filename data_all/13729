got it so I should clarify pristine it's a good question I'll show you what I mean by that let's say I add to cart and I've not actually go back to the category page it was not the segment where they were still selecting different variations it was after I had selected the variants that I'm interested in an added cart the confirmation pop-up that came up that's the one I'm talking about let's see if I add to cart here not this page so let me click ok got it so that's that's what I meant so.,
