yes yes we do we we track their activity so for example if I once web engage is integrated on your platform and anonymous users who have not logged in they land on your platform they view some products they add something is the cart we will know that there is some user who's doing this but we would not be able to engage them on emails and SMSs is because we don't have that information yet with us but you would be able to reach out to them on channels which do not require personal information like browser push notifications on site pop-ups.,
