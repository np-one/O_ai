yeah well I like my sense right now is just given what our actual sales are that I think that that seems like that would be way too much way too expensive for us at this point I mean I think it would be very challenging for even during the POC serious let's say that that was the we're gonna be proving that value particularly I have been part of the problem is that is the current state of the site you know kind of not really complete so I could see I mean like I said I mean I I think the product looks good it looks like you guys do a great job and I can see that you know makes a lot of sense I just don't think I think that it's not something that we can afford at this stage may be something we could you know look at further on down the line we evolved farther something.,
