I'm sure you understand the importance of search but one of the most important thing that I want to highlight here is that 80% of your visitors will leave the site after having a poor search experience. They are not able to find or search for what they are looking for they believes that you do not carry it right these these retailers are so habitual of searching for things or products today on Google and Amazon and getting the most relevant reserves that they believe that that if your site is not showing them the right set of results you do not carry. They might not go and browse and navigate it on the site and that's where the relevant search experience becomes very important.,
