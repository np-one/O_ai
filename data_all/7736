this is like a parts warehouse site that we power there again based in the midwest the primary cell parts before they came to us they actually had two different search boxes because their customer behavior was either they have customers who come in search by an exact part number or there are customers who come in search by say a model name right so they thought having two different of search boxes will actually solve the problem but it actually amplified the problem because you have to manage two different search experiences now . so what we did is you can just pick the first in here right so if you start typing in the biss one side you would see parts one side you would see model names and then we also given them a widget which shows all the tops of which is starting with B is s right we'll build something very custom while if you go to say US Patriots they have an interesting business where they actually said military apparel to normal personnel and for them they wanted a guided navigation scope that  being offered to a customer and also show visual representation of their top-selling products right for them if I say and I wear I'm probably as a user looking at Nike we've given them a scope where we show Nike as a brand and all the top categories with Nike it's are being sold in the last seven days and also exposed to what else is available in the inventory give them like a visual tour of all the popular products on the site and also show them all the top queries available. again something built very very custom for them right if go to somebody can Ib supply industry for blind that you talking to you about why this l'hotel also showing you another one in just grassley in velocity the example is uniquely pissed people had about 14-15 products in a transaction might be same in your case where people buy more product in a single transaction here they wanted an option where people can add products to cart in the fastest possible manner.,
