so my suggestion is for you to test is without paying as anything asked Malaysian team they know exactly how to upload the catalogue into our system and test it on one category in dev environment that's in <> simply test it take one category page test it you you see that any other page on that category let's say for example you go and say hallo style is what I'm gonna try if I click on hallo style from the home page it shows up in a second because it's coming from unboxd  if I go to solitaire index the accents it takes more than a second its speed is faster you don't even have to actually create any kind of results that just let the results be dumped right you just dump the result then you know exactly how fast the result something down I would imagine they can test this very quickly unless they come back and tell you it's gonna take 100 hours of real time which I doubt.,
