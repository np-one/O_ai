and we also do a few cool things like detecting colours right I'm not sure how relevant it could be on your site but I look for on your site event and look for a black t-shirt right there is one black t-shirt that it shows but it also shows other colours right but if if you had to get a little more complicated and it's have to search for a crimson t-shirt right you might not have crimson on your inventory but the system understands that crimson is in the red family so that at least so a red colour to user and not showing a blue or black which is fully relevant to what I'm looking for it also does that so that it's very easy for you to start showing the most relevant results are not so something which is not relevant for easy right.,
