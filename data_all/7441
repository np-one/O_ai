so let's say you know so this is an e-commerce context example again but let's say if somebody would search for a women's white jeans the tech doesn't match with essentially you know do an anding or an or-ing which means it would either be a women's and white and jeans or women's or white or jeans and what happens in this process of doing a text pattern matches while you know there could be a few products you know which is women white jeans it does show a lot of irrelevant products along with the right products let's say you know you'd see a lot of white tops women's white tops while you search for women's white jeans and just and that's essentially because they're doing an exact text pattern matching now with Unbxd what we do is so I don't know if you've heard of the tf-idf algorithm and you know that's that's the algorithm study even Google uses but you know but what we figured out is that while your algorithm itself is really strong but it's essentially made for document search and not from any e-commerce context standpoint.,
