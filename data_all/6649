Okay fantastic so what we have done is we insert a small Unbxd script between your staging prop and your indexing prop so here let's say staging prop gets fired it pushes any changes that the merchants have done any catalog changes whatever the merchants may have been doing into your master solar right then step two it will fire in Unbxd script what this under Unbxd script does is it takes the solar from the master solar the catalog and pushes it to the Unbxd SFTP and second it calls an Unbxd API to start uploading from Unbxd SFTP to the Unbxd index and then that staging prop finishes then you have indexing prop it starts will give you another script that actually checks the status of that Unbxd upload so it will either say it is still working or it's complete like a success once it fires the success you can do your prod prop may be a typo there I apologize it's a prod prop and a slave solar push and then you can as last step you can do your clear cache etc and basically get that particular changes into production and this is exactly how we do it with the check today and the start to finish from the script getting fired in step two within staging prop to step two in indexing prop for about 45000 products takes about roughly seven to eight minutes by the way how big is the catalog for Petco just out of curiosity.,
