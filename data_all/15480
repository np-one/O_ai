Yeah so that will give it it's an extremely robust platform and we've soon written multiple zones across Amazon across the world because we are these global customers with this team then with mirroring that they've enabled on the platform itself so from a dia perspective you're fairly fairly well covered and there are these large enterprises right we have new and we've actually an expression target for its international sites they they all use us so and and and trust me once you see see the value associated and if you start showing you that n X 15 X ro and if we can come in and in 90 days improve your site conversions and two digits even if it's a as low as 10% if we can make that difference then you start trusting us more if we can show you a very very flowery presentation sure we'll show you a bunch of big names that we work with but site I know as this extremely internal what works for a customer X will probably not work for you the same way. I was a big fans of actually trying on the hole right at so many custom he lost one year especially like 500 600 customers just primary by this approach use it for three months see how you feel if you if it makes sense to you commercially then you invest more time resources go the API route have better control and we will do what we do best. Cause what I think what I can see like being solution for may be trying out the API operations basically just communicating with the via the back end because we also have a team of dedicated from 10 people or more or less just doing this that's kind of suffer had a design team that would like to be very much more hands-on so the API solution would work for us we're like try it out you know pass some of the queries there I can see you and see what kind of results we will be getting from there compare them to ours and and that works out we're pretty much on board I think because as you demoed before they came back our search results could be a lot lot better what I'm curious about is how you guys would solve the language problems and things like that we ourselves so like almost given up it's not something we'll be giving up since it's quite important but it's this is where we needed some help.,
