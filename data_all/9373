So let's assume that I search for women's white jeans and I got three jeans and one white top and sometimes the white top will show up because it might say women's white top goes great with jeans okay. And just because those three words exist a tf-idf system will think that this is a good product to actually show in the search results and in the in red are the tf-idf scores for these products. Now why does a white top have a higher score than a white jeans is because sorry it's because tf-idf only looks at either the popularity or the rarity score. It does not give you usefulness score so what Unbxd is done is to overcome that tf-idf limitation we've built another layer on top of that call relevance gain. So what relevance gain actually does is it creates a context in e-commerce to understand that jeans is the more important keyword then women's and then white okay. So when that happens we will give more weightage and relevance to to jeans okay now this is the first piece so semantically we try to understand and see that these are the products that actually need to be shown and given better weightage.,
