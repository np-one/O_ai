Let me get on to Technologies right these were few of the UI elements very specific to customers and we can design these based on your need and not required but the core technology so the before Unbxd started both the founders actually spent quite some time Goodwin here are doing research on two things one they they crawl through various different catalogs available out there on the web look at how these catalogs are configured and how these product catelogue attributes were defined B there is a lot of research in terms of how people search today online be it on an e-commerce site or even on Google or Yahoo and we define the the search queries into twelve different types . And these are the only twelve different types of queries that can occur on an e-commerce site an exact search of feature search of say a black dress where black is a feature of the product dress thematic search could be party tops where party is a theme of the product top. Natural language query wherein people you say under or for in and in the query itself then say a slang or abbreviation search but in MTB for mountain bikes or I'm looking for a 55 inch TV and instead of inch I put double quotes out there right so those becomes more of more of abbreviations on our cilantro and. It's important that the search system is able to understand all these different search query types The the customers have this behavior because Google today understands all of this and they expect the e-commerce site also to understand things with us we have built a technology that is able to understand 85 to 90 percent of your search queries irrespective of what kind they are here,
