the next piece was from an experienced perspective of synonyms and stemming so you know we were looking at a six-inch clamp as opposed to where we spelled out six inch forces we put in six double quotes you know there were challenges with the products their bathroom faucet where we say bath space room with bath without space faucet right then we went into the error correction pice if I make a spelling mistake okay I search for vacuum cleaner and I've spelled back here and obviously it also again shows your result and I'm assuming these are also the types of results that you guys look at and say oh we got zero results because it's a misspelling typically what I've seen historically with old systems or even with other systems you have to create a synonym on the back end.,
