You know I totally agree with you on the mobile is that something that you know we started we have a presence on we need to do more and so you know I think everything that you've said is aligned with our strategy I think the challenge for us to engage Is that for the work that we we're currently doing in order to kind of go back to your indicator example to build that out and to make it work correctly is already set forth where were very much committed to a process and resources to kind of have that that indicator functionality with stemming type-ahead and then what you didn't talk about was really some of the URL work that you could possibly do and really optimize name of site with Google's make sure that you got all of your pages correctly indexed and searchable you know that's probably a big piece for us. The synonyms are also that that key forest I think the other thing that I would suggest for you is it's also possible to have the same part number in multiple categories. And you know that's something that like synonym synonyms were also doing and when a customer searches for something to return multiple categories which we don't do today so you know you might have the auto say the neon indicator but you might also want to return maybe some of the associated parts that go with the wiring cable I mean those are things you could do whether you do it you know through the search you can also use some very good algorithms which which are available you know that will crawl your website and and give you all of the Associated accessory parts.,
