correct because the search is actually doing an orange a technique calls or or so what it does it it says I'm gonna look for the word gold or the word plates and I'm gonna find all the results and start showing them now you might have some default order in terms of how products show up which is why some gold plate shows up and some gold cutlery shows up the way to resolve this is by doing a semantic relevant search so when I'm searching for plates right the idea is that you need a system that understand that when searching for gold plates that plates is the product and gold is the color attribute so I'm searching for gold plates I want to see plates with gold colour up top rather than see forks and knives and paper napkins and this and that.,
