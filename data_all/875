so this was the first experience right and I'll start addressing as to what are the challenges that could be with a solar based on an inbecka based approach that you might be having today it is very difficult to build a logic on auto suggest and also change products dynamically based on segmentation and we can do various kinds of segmentation here like one of the logic they have applied is Geo location but we can do segmentation by a user type it which might be relevant in your case it could be a new user versus and returning logged in user you could show him or her specific set of products we can show recommendation based on past purchases that we could do we could also build an experience like where if you have people who buy more than one product in a single transaction and with Granger you might have a lot of repeat users who already know what is available on your site and they might just want to come and do a fast checkout right this is where we could also help where for somebody like grocery which where this experience is very similar this is actually one of the largest e-grocers in Southeast Asia we also work with in Fresh Direct in New York but these guys is have a much larger volume Midwest they actually do about two billion dollars online and for them their average cart size is 46 products in a transaction and what we did for them is if I buy chicken every week and if I'm a returning user the moment I start typing in chicken the way the auto suggest functionality is built is where you can actually change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box either and then we show all the commonly search term popular brands and categories so you can really customise it to where you want to show it right.,
