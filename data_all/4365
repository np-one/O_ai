Then what I looked at is the overall site search speed on the site the site search pages were loading almost 300 hundred percent slower than the industry standards today the industry standard being 300 milliseconds typically Google says anything less than 300 hundred milliseconds is not being observed by human eye and that's where this whole standard of 300 milliseconds come from and today some of the regions especially north and north central and the East I would say are somewhere closer to thousand milliseconds right almost 300 percent slower then what it should be.,
