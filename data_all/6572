Okay all right so let's get into technology at a little bit of a high level I want to give you guys an idea as to why is it that Unbxd and how is it that Unbxd actually looks at this and tries to solve this So Unbxd unlike a lot of other systems looks at every individual query and performs these four functions per query so semantic relevance search exclusion user behavior this is our machine learning search and any kind of merchandising that somebody might have applied okay so let's get into every single one of them very quickly and I'll take a very simple example just to demonstrate what challenges you might be facing today and how you might be able to solve it today versus how Unbxd approach it and how we like to solve it So let's say we take a simple query women's white jeans Today's techniques whether you use solar out or elasticsearch or say deca There are only three outdated techniques that you can use to actually solve something In solar there's actually only two and in deca provide probably one more So there's something called or-ing where I would search for say women's or white or jeans or ending so or-ing is considered like a loose definition of configuration ending is the strict definition of how we want solar to interpret so it might say women's and white and jeans but both have problems because or-ing might end up showing you women's white shoes or jackets maybe not necessary jeans and ending might actually show fewer products than what exists and in deca I don't know if you guys have considered deca or not but there are a lot of other solutions out there which are very similar to this which might give you a third option to say do a minimum match but there's more than two keywords so it might say women's white or white jeans but because it's again introducing this concept of or you again get irrelevant results like women's white jacket or maybe little girls white jeans and what we believe just looking from the outside and on Petco our observation was there lot of manually merchandised queries like redirects and such and but then there you guys are probably also using and as a configuration in solar is that a correct assumption or are we wrong there.,
