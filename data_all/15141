so the first thing I looked at was auto-suggest that's the first interaction that a customer makes on a website right start searching for something and it's highly important that we start guiding the customer from the very first interaction that they make on the website and that being the auto-suggest. see you do not have an auto-suggest feature yet neither so given it's not there a lot of websites out there have it but at times it's not visual it is  I not guided and I'll show you how you can have this feature with Unbxd and not just have but make it also visual and guided and I will show you some of the live examples as well.,
