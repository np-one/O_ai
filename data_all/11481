no no I the only reason I say this is what what we do from our guarantee perspective is let's say I come in and say based on what Dale that we see we'll be able to do at least 5% and we'll come in and say let looks at 5% or cost is $5000 if you don't do five percent if you do four point nine percent you only pay as half of that you only pay as $2500 you don't pay us five thousand dollars because you might want to continue using us because we're at least doing four point nine percent you might not want to take us out and over time we might do eventually better.,
