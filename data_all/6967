I know its 45 minutes but I'll give you a quick tour of how a merchandising tool works we just add a new dashboard to lase I'm just trying to let out for you so now I think the interest of time I'll show you older dashboard in the older dashboard but essentially at a high level if you have multiple subdomains or multiple environments like a stating production testing you can essentially manage all your environments in a single window all Unbxd related documentation is available here and you can give specific user access permissions to every individual you can send us the catalogue in any format it could be a song XML CSV or in this dump it on a FTP location we can pick it up or we can do a real-time API call to actually pick up the product and do any dynamic indexing that's quite the thumb rule we do a full catalogue update once a day or a differential update every 30 minutes but again we can tweak the frequency how you want to tweak it on an average if you have say even 5000 products changing or 10000 products changing it will be done overall process will be done in less than a minute so that way it shouldn't be a problem .,
