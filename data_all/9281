Mm-hmm so can you if right now I'm not prepared to say that if you reveal around this test or not I need to think about it process the information so we can follow up on this later but I would really appreciate it if you could send me information in terms of maybe some steps in terms of how this tests are normally implemented my assumption is they don't need to implement the pixel or what do we need to do before we can run this test so if you could send some additional information in terms of complexity how to implement the test and then if there is pricing associated with us if we need to bait people to run this test I'd need to know that as well .,
