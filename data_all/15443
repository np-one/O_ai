Got it so Google Analytics has a particular limitation so let's say if I Went to your site and I searched for Nike t-shirts or one of the examples that Ashish were showing I don't find good results then I go to the category page I go through the navigation and I find the product I'm looking for and I end up bind it but Google will tell you is that that search session had a conversion which is true but it's misleading right I searched in that session and I bought in that session but those who are not correlated so you will think that that particular query is doing awesome in which inpact it's not doing really well so Unbxd actually fixes that problem and based on that principle we create three tiers of reporting so the top tier will give you an idea of the exact overview of what search results look like from a conversion funnel perspective second would be your top search queries very helpful for your PPC campaigns top products that are being added to cart top click products and zero results queries. Now zero results queries by the way you can handle and manage them the same way we did that April clearance query right you can create converted it to its landing page and show curated products that you want to show . The second tier is showing results per query so now let's say with Unbxd you your conversion rate is 5% let's say just for sake of discussion which query is now performing at half a percent or 1 percent you can easily drill down into this individual query and see why particular queries not perform you can see what the trend line of that queries was that query always underperforming or used to really perform well and now suddenly it has gone down you can see what products show up particularly for that query and what is the conversion funnel of that query.,
