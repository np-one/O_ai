With when it comes to Express the approach we took was they are an omnichannel retailer they have a lot of stores and they also have an online presence which is actually growing pretty well in the last two years so we wanted to give their users a looking field where when they go to an express store they obviously will first go to a specific tile then look at a specific category and then look at a specific product right so we wanted to give a similar experience with an auto fun auto fill function where they also have the same product discovery path right so today if I start looking for say something like jeans on the site right we wanted to show is it jeans for women jeans for men or is it jeans of a specific style and then express wanted us to put up a segmentation block depending on the Geo-location that I'm coming in from they wanted to show a specific color of jeans or a kind of feature of jeans it's actually very popular in that region.,
