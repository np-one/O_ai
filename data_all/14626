synonyms but you can also build unidirectional synonyms and replacement synonyms on the backbone and when I take you to the dashboard I'll show you how simple it is to do that right and again just to repeat myself you don't have to build manually or create synonyms for any kind of spell checks for any kind of stem words we already have a repository of close to 120 million words there is foundational to the platform which will resolve for anything which is a fairly common word I mean the etail world automatically the only time that you might have to build synonyms yes if you have to build for something which is very specific to your verticle any questions Chris.,
