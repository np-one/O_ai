let me get back to you on that I work with Amanda to coordinate babble yes certainly I think what we need to do is come up with a almost like a you know a clean up plan if you will to to take what we inherited and point where we can utilize it much more effectively because like I say put on so you can see when you pulled up our website there's a lot of aging data there and I think savanna is taking initiative to run run with this from a support perspective Sales Operations perspective but one of the things that we'd like to do lean up all that data and get to a point where we can start managing it the way you showed in your demonstration and then also add in some of these other features maybe even adding in the phone side of it to actual service operations in addition to our sales support operations.,
