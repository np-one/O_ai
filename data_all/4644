great so and one of the things that I also wanted to check with you was I know and I understand when it comes to search and product discovery it it's very intrinsic for every retailer your needs might be very very different from any other retailer we could have worked with so we also have a POC model what we generally do is we come and implement the solution generally in a four to six week window and then we actually lightly use the solution for six to eight weeks the intent here is to a for you to understand how the relevancy works in our system and what we also want to do is also show you a lift in conversions because if we have built a good search system it should possibly start impacting other ways for you.,
