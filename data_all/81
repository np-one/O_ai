the case may be you know that it's rifle helmets etc different categories etc so we have a technology to solve it two different ways the first way is here where we figure out the all the right subcategories and show them in the right order of importance this is based on user behavior and but we also show products just in case the customer had no intent to really buy they were just browsing right second to make it even easier to browse let me show you an example so there it is okay so if search for Alexander Wang who is a designer makes a lot of different categories of products so we show all those categories of products on one page easily bucketed we call it a bucketed search so I search arrives in the Wang I show tote bags because tote bags are the bestsellers from Alexander Wang then I show all shoulder bags then I show all dresses sandals pumps so on one singular page I can show all the products neatly bucketed in such a way that if the customer has no intent they still can browse have it intend they can easily get to the category that they wanna get to.
Next is the like dynamic filters and I understand you don't have a lot of attribution but this is something unboxd has actually solved well if you have different attribution and you've optimised it for the navigation pages you can extrapolate from navigation into search automatically okay so let's say for shoes in this example these are the filters that I wanted for shoes in this order of importance it does not matter how I search for shoes shoes casual shoes men's shoes men's casual shoes men's Nike men's adidas does anyone have to have the word shoes in it we automatically show these filters and in that order of importance and you can have different categories different search terms we automatically extra polite and show the right set of filters this may not be as applicable if you have large filter options we provide search within the filter and also we order the filter options based on popularity.
Next is variances if the same product was available in multiple colors sizes at several different images for each one of them we also solve the variance problem if I was to search search for say red dress here I'll actually show the red image of that dress right in sort of the primary image we also have color synonyms on the back ends already built out so this let's say somebody was looking for coffee colored something and you didn't have coffee in the catalogue but you had brown we know their coffee and brown in close proximity to a shade will automatically show brown if you have coffee will show coffee first and then brown  here's some outdated options as far as your results so I don't know what celebra says I totally forgot to check this out for you let's just force this they always just show all products is that the number of products you have .,
