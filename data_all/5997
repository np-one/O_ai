and the next piece is specific to the synonyms and spellcheck you know like I mentioned so in most cases it's it's mostly a manual efforts to go back identify that you know that there's a query that's not working and and to go back and build a synonym for that but Unbxd been able to do is with respect to synonyms and stemmed words we were able to solve solve for it 90% of the times and that's out of the box without you really having to build out anything on the back end and similarly for spell check or spelling mistakes we were able to solve for it 85% of the times out of the box again without you having to put in any manual effort .,
