got it so because you guys are Magento you have a Magento extension you install the extension and essentially that gives you the ability to call unboxd so the extension that takes care of getting us the catalogue so you can define which columns of the catalogue come to unboxd and then you can make calls to unboxd shut up Magento and unboxd will respond in a way that Magento understands and then you can start showing the results and it will give you a simple div tag for the autocomplete for the type-ahead piece.,
