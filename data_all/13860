so let's say for example I want to slot in position 3 & 4 so I can choose the block 3 & 4 and I want it to show products from a specific rule set so I'll just pick something that there's floral I believe I'm not mistaken so floral is one of the attributes so there we go so in 3 & 4 as you can see now I can actually see products based on that rule set so sometimes you know you might want to.,
