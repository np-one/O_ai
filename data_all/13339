because your default Magento if you let's say you go out of inventory okay they're still gonna show up or if you just tuned it that way that it don't shit doesn't show up it's not gonna replace itself but something else you all you have to always do is manually figure them out and if to manually place them and also depending on what the customers behavior has been on the site it doesn't change and adapt so for example I'm showing some top sellers and let's say I'm spending a lot of time on red shoes red color for example the top sellers will automatically adapt and start seeing more red color shoes based on the styles that you are looking at.,
