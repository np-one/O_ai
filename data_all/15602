If I was to search for Alexander Wang who makes a lot of different products like tods shoulder bags shoes dresses you see all of these products neatly bucketed into each category giving you the ability to browse through these products on a single page horizontally or vertically. Dynamic filters big differentiator we bring to the table I notice that you do not have filters today on the site on the current site now these are dynamic in nature in two ways. One so say for a category shoes as a category you you would want to set up a very specific filters which are relevant to shoes category say size and call height width casual shoe type now if the customer comments comes onto your site and searches for shoes and no matter how the search for shoes beat men's casual shoe shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes and they might come and search for say men's Adidas or men's Nike as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category that being shoes here the shoes filters would automatically kick in. Right so you don't have to go and set filters for search queries that's one way now the second level of the dynamicity of of these filters is over a period of time said people were clicking on width as a filter more often on the price as a filter more ofter than the size or the ankle height width would show up on top of the page right in the order of of what filters the customer sees and the most popular filter will be on top and then in order of popularity they will have the different filters.,
