Sorry I had on mute again I mean I think this is very relevant in fashion but I mean when I go to other sites search as a competitor sites IKEA Container Store and if I say I want a blue fabric door if I type in blue then it will all come up.

So someone you know wanted if we wanted to promote a certain <sub Ram> we could.,
