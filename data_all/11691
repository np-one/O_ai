Yeah so this is where we need to understand the product what is written in that product so that we can start showing similar products that will help the customer to do alternate product discovery right. So you might as a user I might come and search for bandages I have seen it on your site you've bandages from multiple companies right multiple brands right so as a user how can I see what is right for me and what is not and how can I see it in a in a very quick single-fold window on my webpage. So I can make a decision faster so showing similar products something like more like this as a recommendation we did or show or showing products or alternate product discovery is what we do with the content thing. And the fourth on the fourth one that we do is is is the algorithms that we've built in for the entire personalization theme and personalization we start looking at what we call implicit user behaviour. So we look at where the user is coming in from which location is he or she coming in from is he a new user or is she repeat user right and what's the seasonality associated with that location. So if a user is coming in from LA what did the last people coming in from LA from the last 30 days actually by on your site right and then we look at any seasonality associated with LA as a location and then we start showing in the right kind of recommendation widgets so that way the user is more likely to buy right.,
