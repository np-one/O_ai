no problem so then we show is essentially the measurement is across discovery of products so as you remember our expertise is not necessarily in everything eCommerce right so we he's taking a long time to check out we may be able to see that they take a long time to check out but we may never be able to interpret as to why but if they are having a hard time finding a product whether it's search whether it's recommendations whether it's navigation we do have an expertise in understanding so we the focus is pretty narrow it's only on those elements of product discovery so I wanted to make sure you the caveat was clear and when the customer experience any kind of feedback in whether it was good bad or indifferent we've categorised it as whether it's good or bad and but it's bad with subcategories it to be severe moderate or mild oh okay.,
