Right so what I try to do is simulate a behaviour wherein say a customer comes and tries to type fast or eventually misspell words on the site right I tried nebulizers with an F instead of Z you see gives me a zero results page I I try the looking for filter you have a lot of filters on the site I try to interchange P and L if someone trying to type fast interchange of words P and L you see zero results page. When I do something similar for for say some of the other customers right and I tried this for ib supply them being a b2b customer of ours I tried nebulizer with an F and you see it automatically corrects it and start showing and start showing me with right nebulizer.,
