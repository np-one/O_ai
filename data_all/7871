So one of the things that we did is while we were building this machine learning algorithm one of the first few things we did is also train the algorithm on what people mean when they search for something in an e-commerce context right because the machine learning algorithm should be able to identify when somebody looks for say if something like women's white jeans in apparel versus a 2% nonfat milk in grocery what does the context of that search query actually means right so we've actually passed the algorithm with over 200 million products and we've also trained it in every single vertical so the system today understands how do you assign weights to keywords and search queries when it is typed in a specific context right.,
