No that is dynamic because what it tries to figure out is my query is women's white jeans so my product is jeans but in the search results I might also get a white top for example because the title of the product might say women's white top goes great with jeans let's say for example or with jeans for example but it's actually a top and not a jeans so that might also show up in the first step of the results collection.,
