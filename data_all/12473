yes that would be better so I think it's best that you know after you finish all the work in the next couple of weeks you can provide us the access then because with Magento we've just seen you know couple of teams making the changes together and it can you know lineups doing a few things so we just want to make sure that when we are working on the staging environment your team has already finished all the work that they're doing so I think it's best you give us the access then.,
