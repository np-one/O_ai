You're not going to be able to put in place then the same thing with some of your the words that you Peck we try and pick words that can be translated in ten languages so there there are things that you know become part of our decision-making process that our knowledge is our experience we already have the content that defines and publishing system that we can work with and deliver that. So there are pieces of it that we can outsource and we do and you know that is sort of some of the ongoing work you can't do everything but some of the heavy lifting yes we can work with consult to help us with and we give them databases and they'll write scripts and refine it for us then from some of the work that you're you're talking about tuning that they can build pieces of it but then essentially become to a point BAU activity is just that becomes part of art this the heavy lifting to initially get it to that point they do but then we really become the champions of having to manage an ongoing thing . And that's you know just the adjustment that you have to make we haven't made all of them things like you said the spelling mistakes haven't touched it and I agree with you huge issue.,
