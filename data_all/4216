so it will start working on day one because we have trained this algorithm on a catalogue of almost 200 million products we scanned almost hundred thousand eCommerce site builds our own catalogues we also run the algorithm through different public libraries like word Nets Wikipedia context net etc and try to figure out all the different variations of how customers misspelled and have tested the system to actually try to learn how to auto correct them and that is how we've been able to train the algorithm to figure that out now so simple words like these black leather jackets out of the box day one but there might be some complicated very specific products that you guys might be you might have for example let's say let's say never encountered the Louie Vuitton okay and but we do see in the catalogue there's Louie Vuitton and the customer search for Vuitton with one T sort of two T okay the algorithm will figure out and say wait a second it seems like there's a spelling mistake we've seen the catalogue there's the words with two Ts and we need to sort of figure out and show to the customer some response with two Ts and then the RNN piece of the algorithm will remember and said we showed you something which two ts did it work they did not work the customers actually click on products did they engage with it and then it'll start to now learn and figure out and say okay for Vuitton with 1 T the correct spelling is 2 Ts because that's what we can counter down and now it over then and its now learned so 85% of the time nine 85-90% of the time it will solve that out of the box there are instances where customers will butcher that so badly that it won't be able to pick it up and you see the traditional way of trying to correct it by creating synonyms is the is still available.,
