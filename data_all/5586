and what we have seen in our experience is customers who go straight for search will give the website three or four chances of searching before they give up but if the customer goes from navigation to search they only give them one to treat chance for search because this would be their second failure in discovering a product so the so the patience has already run out have to have to be passed away when they're searching so search in that sense becomes critical especially coming from navigation all right low specific tasks so one user wanted to look for a shrub below three feet and use the search button and got only one relevant result later they switched to navigation bar and clicked on shrubs and hedges and partial and used filters based on size and they were happy to see the result another user searched for red flowering plants and was shown mixed results his experience would have been better if had the option to filter color now I'm assuming the color is not an option because the catalogue doesn't contain that is an attribute.,
