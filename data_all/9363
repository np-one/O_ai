Perfect alright alright and I think I had found some similar examples I was I think I was looking for pink kids pillows and I know the first we look like kids pillows but then I used I started to get all these types of things where I would get storage and headboard you know. It's like I understand the relevancy perspective that's I think I was looking for dining chairs and I think I accidentally misspelled because I thought maybe in the beginning I was looking for dinner or something and I started looking for dining chairs. And I think I started to get sofas and in accent chairs a lot more accent chairs and here's was an interesting one. This is something so my mom she's obviously getting old not that I tell her that but she just moved in with us and she loves to read on this shiny new iPad she's gotten so she likes to read it in the corner of her family room. And we were just looking for a recliner sofa for her and I was just trying to search for something reading recliner and unfortunately this is the solution this is a results that I get. So I I was trying to go I was gonna ask you guys to say is relevancy going to be a challenge but I'm glad Shannon you mention that so what about spellcheck because I think I looked at dining chairs and I misspelled dining obviously is spellcheck also something that you guys see is common not just relevancy in combination.,
