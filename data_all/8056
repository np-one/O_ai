because we see these are common queries because people have either looking for some kind of sale some kind of clearance they don't want to buy anything on full value it should be able to look at the catalogue pull up all the dresses and even at a long tail show you all dresses on sale and now somebody goes and looks for dress on clearance I misspelled the word clearance it should auto correct the word clearance and then show up all the results which are actually on clearance so it does fairly complex thing and it can do even things like I can look for tops for women size 10 or size XL if you go and pull up tops which are for women which are available in size 10 that's the strength of the algorithm we've built it .,
