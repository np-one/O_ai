So one of the things on say that you pointed out right people are searching more based on your player names right so what if you started showing basketballs and and some of the top players and baseball and some of the top players just an just a random idea that I have but there are few various different elements right that we can bring into picture it's not just about adding to cart adding to cart is a functionality that works more on a transactional site so personally I would not advise you to have add to cart right here correct people might not just buy it from search box because this is not a transactional purchase that they're making it is not grocery.,
