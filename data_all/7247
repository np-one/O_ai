Like I start looking for jeans it shows me jeans fro men and jeans for women and depending on my location it will start picking up what was the most popular products show displayed in the location and we gave them a segmentation logic here where it either display by location or they can display by popularity as to okay red jeans is probably the most popular jeans sold this week so show red jeans and again show the men women and then show all the top queries.,
