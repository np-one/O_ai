yeah and then what we did in this study we actually were looking at your site and looking at things like t-shirts and if you type in t-shirts you're not getting t-shirts as opposed if you navigate to t-shirts you are going yeah what we would say that whether someone it's the task that people take should be completely irrelevant you want people to take whatever path through your site that is the most natural and comfortable for them and the results that they obtain should be consistent and should be the same this is important while they're on the site but it's also critical if they come back the next day and they try to find a product that they were browsing as they find the same products.,
