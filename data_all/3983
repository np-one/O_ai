Okay awesome thank you so the other thing that we do is automated redirect. So if I come to your site and say search for something like a laptop right instead of taking me to a search page the best place for me for you to take me is to your category page itself because your category page will have the most relevant results for laptops. So what we do is if you are looking for something which is which matches to a category page we immediately redirect you to that category page. So that you start finding the most effective results right so the other thing that's important for you will also be filters I did see you've defined some nice set of filters.,
