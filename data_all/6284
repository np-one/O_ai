so what you're seeing in the video here is our a product where let's say I'm looking at casual shirts this is just a apparel example but for casual shirts I want to run a campaign on the site will start daytime end daytime and I want to then figure out what to show to a particular segment of customers now how do you segment them you might be from our experience working with almost 1200 websites we've seen that the big segment is first-time visitors and repeat visitors right your first-time visitors or new visitors typically have a tendency to buy something that's not so expensive or something that very popular and you want to make sure that those types of products are one that a first-time visitor actually see but repeat visitors are less price sensitive they are willing to pay more because they've done their research and now they've come back for the value and they're willing to pay a little bit more for the last,
