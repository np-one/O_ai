OK so I just quickly make a note of these things in my phone just to be sure and what I do is I will also be sending you a few designs for the autosuggest so that you can just quickly go through them and let me know if there's any specific design that you like and we'll go ahead and implement that specific designer and I know I shared those in the past with you but I just resend them to you just so beginning a refresher on what design would suit the site the best and I think once we design for the search bar it's gonna be a lot easier for us to then go ahead and make the auto suggest design based on that .,
