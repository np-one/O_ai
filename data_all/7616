It yes it makes sense and yes I get it but our customer really doesn't use search much and I think it's because our product assortment I they don't have so many products on the site that she can't find what she's looking for and use a search so where I think if our if we had more styles and she was frustrated in trying to find what she was looking for by just browsing she would use search more but she likes to shop. My time on site is about 6 minutes and my pages per visit is approx of 6 to 7 so she's a she's a browser she likes to shop and look as opposed to knowing specifically what she's looking for come search add it and buy.,
