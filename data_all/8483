If I was to take an example I'm the closest that I could I could think of was filters and you have so many various different filters now if someone comes on your site and looks for filters you show seven thousand seven hundred and forty nine products right and the only way for them to filter rate is through the facets on the left hand side choose the right facet and start seeing seeing the products that they might be more interested in which is which is a very traditional way of navigating the customers through a larger set of search results page right. But with us what we do is we put in various different elements to it right we have the technology to identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity so here say for mobile we are yet not clear about the intent of the customer so we start showing various different categories crossing mobile right so it could be mobile mobile headphones cases and covers mobile headset. And at the same time we start showing results for the most popular category that is mobiles here right so we have started showing Mobile's over a period of times customers customers were clicking on mobile cases and covers more often then mobile cases and covers would come on position two and the mobile headphones would go on position three right. So that's where the popularity comes into picture and the relevance also improves and that covers and cases is the more profit preferred sorry category than headphones and that that's more important so should be on on on the top order and not at the lower fold.,
