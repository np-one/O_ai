And we all merchandising dashboard so if your merchants and marketing team wants to control and override our base algorithms to solve for any business requirements like inventory clearance or promotion of products the brand promotion etc we also have a much in a very strong orchard at the dashboard should be easy to you and the last piece is be machine learning. So after all of this is done ultimately it's the artificial intelligence and machine learning that two built in then does a lot of figuring out in terms of what products to show when to show how to solve relevancy etc so let's say for example you'll be talking about butter you have fifteen butters that you're buying at first level we want we will start to show the most best performing butters up top for that location for that catalog of inventory eventually you'll also add a layer of Personalization and I'll show you an example just to give you a context so here we have a customer called Big basket and sorry I'm using a hotel internets it's a little bit slow but let's say if I started to search for bread right and I wanted to I usually buy a multigrain bread versus you always buy the bread brown for that particular brand if we both search for bread I will actually see the multigrain bread up top you will actually see the bread brown up top and there is a few different components in how we can actually create a better user experience for that particular customer is you can see with the autocomplete because customers buy thirty forty forty five products in a single transaction as soon as you start typing in what you're looking for we bring in all the different elements that are important for customers to make a decision to buy if you're these are products they've already bought in the past because in grocery you typically buy the same product every week or every other week we start showing those up top so you can just change the quantity and Add to Cart from right here for products that you don't normally buy like during seasonal events or some holiday party or summer party etc. You also call me search terms some popular brands and some category as well and and it's not just discs where you can search for any any clear such a search for just a chicken if I'm searching i if I usually buy chicken masala or chicken boneless breast I'll see that up top if if you are looking if you talk to typically buy chicken leg without pin that's what you'll start looking at up top that's the other component on top of all of the relevancy and limitations of Endeca is we solve that and on top of that we take the experience to that next level with personalization.,
