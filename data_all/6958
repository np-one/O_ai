then finally how do you personalise zero results again I do see some good matches here you show some top sellers when it when you land up in a zero is our page some of the things we've tried doing is also segmenting it for a new user versus a repeat user intent here is give more call to action for user to do when he or she lands upon on a land page like this and we can customise it for a new user what products do you show for a returning user what products you can show and how what kind of widgets you can actually display on a search page.,
