Sounds good so let me start with what I've reviewed on on your site right and then this is not to criticize <> and this is terms of what are the areas of opportunities we see on. So Michael the first thing I looked at on your site was the autosuggest functionality it's good that you have a visual autosuggest with the images of the products some of the products showing up there but it's still on guiding me right I put in so far <> maybe this is hard coded based on the best intelligence and brings in you have put these items in a particular way right but it does not guide the customer does not help the customer to narrow down to some of the Things some of the subcategories of so far if you are even say table even could be a coffee table could be a pet cited right various different kind of tables so it does not guide the customer and I'll show you how you can start guiding the customers when they through auto suggest also what I noticed that say and I look forward <> so far it gives me no results within the autosuggest. And that's another area of opportunity and I look for the site search speed in general I'm tried for dining table as a query you will see that that from some other <> the speed is very low it's it's over one thousand two hundred thousand twelve thousand milliseconds actually in one case if there's it is more than eight thousand nine thousand milliseconds typically should be within 300 milliseconds this is what is recommended. Then I looked at relevancy and this was interesting I was.,
