another thing that we have done as a foundation of the platform is also tried analyse how people buy products on an e-tail site it could be any tail site broadly there's about 12 ways people look up for information right in a site like yours they might come with an exact product name that they want to buy they probably exactly know what to buy or they might know an exact part number that they might want to come and buy and then if you go into any apparel space they might probably buy by a specific theme to be say cocktail vases or formal trousers right on if they might be going into an appliance store where they're looking for a specific feature right probably related to  <> data and and then if you were one thing you also notice in the last 12 months there's been a huge influx of natural language queries probably they were less than 1% or 2% in most e-commerce sites but we have seen today that especially sometimes in apparel the number is beyond 10% because that's how people are used to buying products on Amazon or looking up for information on Google so the way we have built a platform is beyond the e-commerce awareness is also building algorithms to resolve for each of these kind of queries out of the box hence the name was actually Unbxd.,
