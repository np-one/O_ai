Agreed agreed Monal did you have any answers to that or any thoughts on that. Yeah I just yeah I definitely want to cover from a data perspective Chandra by the way while we take your solar index we re-index that data the way we distribute the data on our side so it's not a copy of the solar index for saving we're just taking your index as a data input but we massage that data which is why like the spelling mistakes or the stemming issues you guys don't have to create synonyms for that's automatically get solves because the way we index that data so that's number one number two is if there are certain requirements from your perspective where you see challenges we can certainly address that from how we index it so that's two the third piece was in terms of the responses if like I said are we usually respond are our API responses are in JSON or XML so what we can what we have done for specifically for WCS is to make sure that the responses look natively like a solar response so if you have done any modifications you can let us know and we can apply the same modifications on our end so you don't have to change any application on your end we can take that our team can take that up as long as you can provide us some guidance on what those changes are and that is not a problem at all that is we are more than happy to take take that from our perspective.,
