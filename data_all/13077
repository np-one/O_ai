products that we don't have on offered like still live on a site so yeah I also I have a question for you and I put this out to where we have to do an integration with whatever your commerce platform would be like this one which is sage 500 we're currently on an app 500 platform and the upgrade probably won't have I've asked the one of the folks that are doing the bids on the integration what the order of operations is in terms of getting a catalog over to a new e-commerce platform because it takes product data from our ERP and pushes it through to UM pushes it through to the e-commerce platform so I don't I don't know if it's gonna be and then we don't have a firm date for that that we're pushing to have it in March but it's up to our IT team to actually do it I mean it was supposed to happen in December and then January and now it's not trying to March so based on that I don't think we're gonna have a like full catalogue on a new site ready until March but I can definitely send you what we have on this site now.,
