yep a very easy way to do that is you can go into our search dashboard you can set up a a rule a site level rule we call it a global rule and you can go in and filter and say if a particular value and you can see rules based on anything I don't want to show products that have inactive or I don't want to show products that are out of inventory you can set that rule one and the search system will automatically not show those results.,
