Yeah so in that case we can actually build something for you where instead of here where you see more like this say it called call it an alternate option of cheaper option or however you wanna name it from marketing perspective. When they click on it instead of showing five it is probably just show me one the details we can build overlays where it probably puts in a specific price and then say some how much percent cheaper is it from the actual product you actually see. We can make it more enticing we can name a price and we can have an overlay here which basically says it is 20% cheaper than the product which probably gives an additional reason for the user to buy we can do that as well.,
