Now the post ninety days right what we can start at at this point in time you say at hundred thousand visitors right and for that you would have I would say anywhere around twenty percent of your traffic must be looking at at search. Then twenty thousand search sessions is what we are estimating so after ninety days I can say at 100000 sessions or at around twenty sessions the solution would be priced at $1000 a month. That would include the site search and product recommendations and then I can give you the range as your your traffic grows how the price would increase but if your traffic does not grow beyond this and you are not committed to pay anything extra but then yeah <>.,
