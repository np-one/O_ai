now I can see that on desktop versus so if I here we were searching for blue jeans and here I searched for jeans so now what I will now do is I search for jeans but I wanted the most cheapest jeans so the most inexpensive ones and big maybe because I'm on a budget I didn't find them so now I will go and search for specific jeans that I now want so I'll go look for than blue jeans and what you'll find your search customers will give you a couple of chances to actually do this to get this right but if you don't get it right in a couple of chances they will leave and go somewhere else in shop and that is the biggest challenge now how do we make it easy I'll show you something.,
