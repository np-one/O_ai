yeah the only reason we don't have the perfect pricing is because we want to make sure that me give you a pricing in the context of what we're going to help you as a proof of concept so we can send you some questions to give you an idea of what we were looking for and I can give you an idea of what our pricing looks like from a base model perspective so I can certainly do that absolutely I can send you that information as well so I can walk you through that our next call that is not a problem.,
