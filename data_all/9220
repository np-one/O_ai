Yes you will have the capability but then that is something that you might want to use very occasionally and some of the corner cases. So one example I will give you right say Eddi square pin printers is very popular in your in your industry and there is Another ABC printer brand that you do not carry today which competes with Eddi sqaure right now someone comes and look for an ABC printer on the site obviously your sight is not going to show them anything because you do not have that that product correct that brand in that case you might want to go back and then create a synonym and say ABC printers anyone searching for ABC printers is equal to Eddie seccure printers secure sorry Eddie secure printers and they will automatically start showing Eddi seccure printers right. Those are the kind of cases then you might want to go and create synonyms but not for the spelling mistakes are commonly known in English dictionary words right words like say game gaming taken care of center central taken care of plurals could be say knife knives right those kind of complicated plurals all that is automated that complete experience is something that that we take care of. May be this this example right cleanup kit versus cleaning kit again something which is a stemmed word it intend this the same irrespective of how the customer searching and this is something that's automated you don't have to do anything here any any questions hope I was able to answer your questions.,
