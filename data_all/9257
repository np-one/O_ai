You'll get a high level understanding what how many products you have was the feed size like and was it last index here are your feeds or product catelog of attributes which we make searchable non-searchable this is for Unbxd internally using this tool again have visibility in terms of how the system is configured . Here you can set global filters I'll show you how you can set these for each category but these filters are across the site very simple to set filters price and you can come in and say here price the for price create a facet. Synonyms again very easy way to create synonyms and this is only four corner cases like the example I gave you lifters I want a bidirectional synonym  or a unidirectional synonym so say shoes create synonym and you're done . Now every time someone looking for lifters will automatically start seeing shoes on the site then let me show quickly show you the merchandising merchandising search let me delete some of the old ones the global rules that you see right if other rules that you would want to set which are applicable across site so say always promote a particular brand right across queries do not show out of inventory product or demote out of inventory product any any such rule which is applicable to all your search queries can be set here but let me take an example and show you how you can actually create rules so dress merchandise and this is the demo site actually for which I'm doing showing you the dashboard me show you what do we see today the dress right so we see a blue flower dress red black and another flower dress right some of the top products on the on the website. And I go back onto the dashboard I start seeing the replica of the site and this is a 90 percent experience these are all dresses these are all relevant results based on popularity to your location set but your merchandisers might want to override the technology and they can start doing that by applying various rules starting with filters they can filter the rules based on any particular category right maybe brand anything else that you feel is important for your business you can run promotions you can start sorting boosting slotting. Let me show you an example say boost I want to boost a particular brand contains Eliza you see all the Eliza products are now on top now even within this say I might want this particular product on top.,
