So I will quickly take you through the implementation stages as well as the dashboard and you could let us know I am not sure how much the holiday season impacts you is it like the is it business as usual  throughout the year do you see some substantial peaks during the november december time frame you can let us know we can do a pilot starting 1st of august like we can take the month of August to do the implementation you can test the product if you’re using nextopia today we can also do an AB test where 50% package goes to nextopia the remaining 50% comes to unbox all through september october and if you’re you’re you’re at least doing  10% or more better than nextopia from 1st november you can cut over to our cost.,
