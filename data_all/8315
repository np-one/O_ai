I just wanted to show you this Michael so we understand this see we work with a lot of customers of your size right a lot of them have moved in from SLI from search string from extopia with that specific hope that they like actually be able to take advantage of the product we've built. and that's why we understand so then we start supporting customers it's not about calling different support packages and charging money for it we definitely don't charge a single dollar for support for us every customer is a premium customer and you actually get access to a dedicated Technical Account Manager. he or she will be that person whom you can call every single day and he or she is will be the person which can help you start driving all these decisions while you start integrating with us we will not we will not let you let you hanging after we have sold the product to you because then it it just does not serve our purpose right. because we have a non binding contract you can walk in walk out of Unbxd at any point in time the only way <>.,
