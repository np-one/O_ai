okay next is the this is something I personally had the experience with I was on the site Saturday morning at eight o'clock pretending to be a customer and I spent our kids coming into a room at eight thirty eight hours passed by and now after eight hours I'm trying to get back to the site so my experience was what will the site do for me to get me back where I had left off because this this is a very much common occurrence in in e-commerce today so we try to recreate it I certainly didn't remember the products that I was looking to buy although I'm not your demographic either but we did try to recreate this we asked all our focus group participants to take only a 15 minute break and we said very clearly remember the product you're very interested in and that you would want to buy.,
