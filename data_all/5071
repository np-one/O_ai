okay all right let me show you what we actually do I'll give you an idea of exactly how we function all right so here's a customer called vacparts warehouse and I know that are not your vertical there you are in the apparel space but I just wanted to give you an idea of how different our implementations are for different customers and why so vacparts we have two types of users one who knows what parts to buy in other words no idea what parts to buy but they know the vacuum cleaner model which you have to account it for this they usually have two search box we came in and from a usability perspective we said you can't have two search boxes because what does it customer makes a mistake and the <<>> is on the customer so we type in Dyson and you can see here the autocomplete actually shows left side part and right inside.,
