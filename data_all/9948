then I looked at commercial stainless steel housing we have all these housings available and we didn't find it so one of the few observationsfirst when i used one word generally the search results were accurate as i start going to the 2nd word 3rd word where i add context to my search is where i see differences between how products show up on your browsed pages to how products show up on search and generally a long tail has a lot of irrelevant queries like it'll still show me one or two results which are accurate but it also shows me a lot of results that are actually not accurate.,
