So our typical POC phase is like for ninety days right so for ninety days you paid twenty thousand mr oh sorry my bad two thousand dollars mrr right so that 2000  for month one two thousand for month two two thousand for monthly three that's your six thousand dollars POC. Out of that what we do is we use the initial four to six weeks to take you live right say typically six weeks to take you live and the remaining six weeks is for you to test this on a live site and for us to prove the increase in conversions right so that's what the 90 days POC is like the first six weeks for implementation and then the remaining six weeks is for going live. And then that takes care of your complete setup for any specific requirement right over and above the standard solution which could be say running price rules right there could be a nominal fee on top of this which would be in the range of anywhere between say five hundred dollars to three thousand dollars depending on the comp the complication.,
