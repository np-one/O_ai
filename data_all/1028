sure that's fine so I think you know my last thought on that and that you know I want to quickly come back to saying that if you were to take scenario that data sets you identified right which is point of sale inventory shipments your internal and external syndicated data  and you get a data and kind of build out couple of scenarios that can help you get more predictions around your product lifecycle your out of stock scenario now this is your promotion effect known as you touched upon that we don't have enough time to go through the detail of you know promotion RIO and you know a function returns but I think I'll keep that in mind is that something that you were particularly at the end. if you were to build these use cases as how do we see it come to life I kind of do some kind of a proof from our side Will that be exciting enough for you know kind of spend more time and you know we can plan definitely have more face to face more closer because I'm interesting over the close by.,
