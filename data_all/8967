In this example you will see black leather jacket all three are misspelled but we are able to auto correct it and in real-time we start showing the results we don't wait for customers to click onto something right. And then we again understand this from user behaviour on the site in terms of how they misspell what are the kind of products they look at we look at what do they mean by by you know when when they start typing in blak right or if they misspell black without the c we are able to understand that what they mean is a black as a colour is what they are looking for right and then start showing the results in the right order. On top of it comes the stemming algorithm sorry the round glasses versus rounded glasses right I one of the example I showed on your site was cart versus carts right. This is something which is again a part of it is built internally and then a part of it is also Machine learning on your system or specifically to your site.,
