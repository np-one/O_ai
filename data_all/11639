And what we do is Chan say we give you the three month break down where we come and say implement the product in under two weeks it do not take us more than two weeks to implement the product. And we let you use the product for the first three months and at the end of three months you can actually make a decision right and for the first three months you don't pay us the full value. You only pay us 50% of the invoice and only if you choose to continue after three months is when you clear the remaining it's in our way we are basically sticking our neck out. And we're saying that we will come an implement and we will show value and if you don't see value there's nothing as a fine print of the contract that will hold me back for a year you're free to walk away.,
