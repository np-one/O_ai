No I mean the integration looks a lot simpler than we we definitely would like to do some kind of POC to see if it makes sense for us if that is possible from your end some kind of a test account or something that we can play around with in terms of red flags except for the product data or the catalogue data I think you are using our own Petco index or the solar index and that is what you guys are using it but on top of it once since you're going to respond back with almost the same results as the solar that is doing it today we might have some customization that we might need to unwind or make some adjustment on your end to make that happen or you get the expected results so that's the only thing I see right now but other than that I mean on the technical side but on the business side I would like still like Connor to review his requirement to see if it meets all your all the use cases.,
