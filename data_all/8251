so what we did is we identified these 12 buckets and we started building out algorithm which are the foundation to our platform to starts resolving to each of these queries to at least like a 90-95 percentile so that we know that most of the questions and queries are the people that a first user will end up in putting on a search box gets resolved in the best possible relevance and since we built this as foundational our search is very different because our search is more contextual. if you have to go to any of the Unbxd site if you're probably one of our apparel covered side and if you go and type and say a black leather jacket water our big data system in the back and we'll understand is jacket is the product product type leather is a fabric attribute and black is a color attribute hence it starts resolving for these things automatically understanding the context and hence our error tolerance is so high. so if you look at this example the same black leather jacket I have misspelt each of these three words incorrectly but since we do contextual relevance the system understands this means black leather jacket it is not only show you the option if there are more than one option it will show you all the two two or three option. and it also starts displaying the results right from the this word book and this is what I was telling you that you don't have to go and build a synonym corpus at your back end to correct for these things the system should be intelligent enough to correct itself similarly with stemmed words the system understands dress dresses wood wooden shoe shoes light lights are all the same and it will not only resolve it it will also start showing these consistent results right.,
