Cool so Monal the first thing that I looked at on your site was the autosuggest that's the first interaction that the customer makes on the sites right when they start typing in few alphabets in the search bar. It's important to start exposing them to the right products to the right categories to the the most popular products or say the search words right the the root words for them to start exploring the products immediately and not wait for them to complete the phrase hit enter and look for a search assistance. And I see there is an absence of this there is this element the most important element of search is not available on the site and I'll show you a few of the examples in terms of how we approach this. Post autosuggest I looked at relevancy and I looked at few tried to look for few products on the site and see how relevant the results were right I look for a white cube organizer you do have quite a few cubic organizers and some of them are also available in white but when I search for it I get a zero result page.,
