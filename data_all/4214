correct this not what we have done it's not something like we have built a better synonym library where we have figured out all the permutations and combinations and mapped it to the correct spelling that is not how we solve it if you actually solve it using distinct algorithm one is the 11 screen algorithm this is a technique that uses and understands whether a customer has transposed letters so let's say or drop a letters for example here I search for black and C is actually dropped the algorithm will actually figure out and say it's possible that this is black it also come back and say maybe it is also blanket but there's another technique called RNN it's called recurrent neural network it will figure out and say maybe in some instances I'll show black some instances also blanket and we'll start to remember and take that feedback whether when I showed blanket for B-L-A-C-K nobody actually clicked on it but when it's shown black customers actually did click on it that means black is a better option for that and over time this algorithm has learned how to solve spelling mistake in in the most optimal way rather than trying to experiment but it does still continue to do that with any new keyword that might be misspelled and tries to figure out using different ways and techniques so what spelling mistake that costumer about to done.,
