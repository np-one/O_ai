So yeah that was a quick high-level background I wanted to through because I don't want to give out make it too information overload but I just wanted to give you all the finer elements of the key things that we actually do and then look for your advice and suggestion as to how do you think we could actually approach though we do too many things we could probably take up one small thing that you think might be most important to Walgreens it could be even as even a category that we could take up say a beauty category that we could take up and try solving it for that category and show some significant performance gains with that category and then see how we can go from there so just thought I'll ask your inputs on that.,
