Okay perfect so this is what our Dashboard looks like today and you can see a very quick overview in terms of where what the status is of the current in of the current indexes you can manage multiple sites through the same dashboard so let's say if you have a dev staging or a production environment you can manage all through the same sort of a login you can define what your skills are searchable not searchable. This is something we'll help you set up you can also define your global facets and as as Ashish had mentioned will also show you how you can override them for specific categories to create dynamic filters but you can define what your global facets are you can also define your synonyms so you can define bi-directional and unidirectional synonyms and we also want to repeat ourselves in saying this as all that as you might have experienced in solar or elasticsearch a lot of spelling mistakes have to be solved by creating synonyms on the back end right. You do not you do not have to create those synonyms for Unbxd 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are automatically solved by Unbxd  system so you don't need to create those synonyms but if you have jargons industry-specific jargons let's say for example in weightlifting world's shoes are called lifters right that something cannot be automated so we easily put in a synonym in there you can easily put in a synonym for that.,
