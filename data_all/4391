Hey Mark thanks so much for A giving us your time One quick question I had I do understand that we had worked with BH photovideo about a year and a half ago we were in the process of evaluation we had also discussed pricing information at that point in time you decided to continue with Endeca so I just wanted to check if if there's an opportunity for us to do some kind of POC show the value associated with our product this time around so just to have gather some thoughts on it.,
