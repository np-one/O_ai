so there is a much more deeper network designing aspect to it it's not just about the location its about what should be the configuration of that location and what should be the overall configuration of the network for the next problem we try to solve in the same suite of figuring out you know if it should be hub-and-spoke model or it should be a simple configuration and if it is a hub-and-spoke what is the simple configuration what kind of transportation mode would optimize the cost order right. so by so by ensuring the initial consulting exercise the real benefit can be taken out of the tools because you can either formulate the problem statement to be as ... so that we can address much more problems than you know just a simple one like you know identify the location.  so this is one of our solutions and any questions here again Kevin.,
