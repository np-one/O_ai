here's what I'd like you to do can you send me all of this in writing send me your proposal in writing at 650 with the navigation I would I'm my senses I would probably have you implemented as opposed to Cora because you guys know your product better and cora tends to charge a lot for design um you know and and I'm I want the autocomplete it was what so right now what we have I'm happy with I feel like it we could probably design it a little better as you do it using some of the things that you suggested and specifically highlighting categories but I definitely want products and that autocomplete maybe not for mobile but certainly for tablet and desktop but in mobile maybe thumbnails might work agreed without the long titles so I just want to make sure that,
