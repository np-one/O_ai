I also want to show you how you can create landing pages right so say clearance 2017 today we don't have anything on the site under Clearance go back clearance 2017 yet rule merchandise we don't see anything because there's nothing on in the catalog right now convert to landing primary run same set of rules plan contains Eliza oops something went wrong mankind is Elijah you can similarly drag and drop in slot you can add banner to this landing page also right. And now if I was to go back on the site and look for clearance 2017 I start seeing the same set of results as under merchandising dash board. You can now take this URL and start using it for any of your email campaigns marketing campaigns SEO campaigns right you'll get a much clearer URL for your marketing this is just a demo site so kind of matured but you'll get a clear link. So that's the merchandising for search and now category quickly for the category rules so say for sneakers as category in merchandise you can add banner once you add this banner it was figure of how someone searches for sneakers these banners would automatically kick in and these filters would also kick in. So for sneakers you can come and say I want the size filter on top drag and drop I want the color filter on position two I want to hide the cat filter I want to hide the test filter irrespective of how some one searches for sneakers could be just coming in and say Nikey as far as 75 products or 75% or more products are from sneakers as a category these filters would starts showing.,
