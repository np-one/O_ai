got it so let's start would be the biggest question is cost what we believe at that time you were paying around $600 to four tell if I'm not mistake right and what we were trying to come up with and say look for the traffic that you have and the catalog size that you have what we can do is for the first year we can give you the search and our recommendations solution both for 600 to show you that we have a better solution than for tell not any better value not just from the recommendations perspective but also by adding the search component to it and so that's the cost we wanted to price match to what 4chan was doing even though we are providing two sets of solutions and products you're willing to take that hit for you and make sure that you get you're not spending any more so you're not spending more to try us but then you'll be also able to see the value that you're bringing to the table so that's the cost that's the monthly cost there is a one-time fee that we proposed of $1000 which is just a setup fee to set up search setup recommendations etc and you know that's just a secondary sort of the cost please so that's number one number two was the implementation so typically the implementation takes about four to six weeks it could be as fast as four weeks because there's not a lot of back and forth and but it could be six weeks where let's say we come up with one design you don't like it you have to go back and make changes to come back with more designs etc.,
