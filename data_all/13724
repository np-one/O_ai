I think there would be an opportunity I think originally before we we really expanded a lot of a lot of our sort capabilities we kind of had this the sequencing option but I believe most of our sorts kind of override that sequencing because you know before we had any of this you could go in and you could say look I want you know that Sh is 0:32 to be in spot one and SS are nine nine seven in spot we could do that but I believe today it's really not functional because of some of our more recent sorting .,
