now we're gonna go into a section called pinning now we did pin on that red t-shirt or the red top category page the difference between plotting and pinning is that let's say when I plotted these two using the rule colour green let's say this particular product goes out of inventory and you have a mass level that says never show products that are out of inventory this product third product will automatically become the second product and in the third block we'll find another available green jean and show it here if there are normal green genes available this part will automatically this block will automatically get squint and you'll see the fourth product in the third position so the system will automatically work and update based on the rules that you've set and now here I'm taking the fourth block and I'm taking this particular jeans and putting it in the fourth block I'm not putting any banner ads or anything like that and I'm gonna publish.,
