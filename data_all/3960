Like here I'm typing la P I'm seeing shoulder bags and some racer laptops and things like that but it's not guided and visual for me as a user right. I'll take you through a few examples as to how you build a visual and a guided autocomplete feature on your site right. Because that we've seen helps you tremendously increase performance on the site the second thing that is important is to have the search relevancy itself right. If you type in a specific search word like I type in laptop I I am seeing a shoulder bag or handbag right so how do you bring in relevant search results when somebody is looking for information on your site right.,
