Yeah so so there's two different components of a/b testing so let's say today you guys use solar and you want to test solar versus Unbxd let's say that's definitely your capability some somewhere you have to get your a/b tested now to just to cover that piece you could also do a before and after or a period versus period comparison so there's ways to do that if you guys don't have any a/b testing capability but as part of the product is concern in the near future in the next couple of months we're coming up with a capability where you will be able to do a/b testing between two merchandising decisions let's say for example you guys decide Conner business team decides and says we have a query called let's say a simple query dog food for dog food we have two different ideas from a couple of different merchants how can we test two different merchandising ideas you will be able to define a particular percentage of traffic that goes with merchandising A percentage of traffic that goes merchandising B maybe some percentage of traffic direct goes to the algorithm etc and you'll be able to see what the results are so that capability is coming I would say in the next 60 days.,
