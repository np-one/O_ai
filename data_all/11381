that could be the other bigger problem where the loading time is really long now we are I'm in Chicago so I don't know if you have optimised the commerce only for Canada and obviously for the US but if that is not the case if you have optimised it for the US then you know that is definitely something to look at so four to five clicks or five taps on mobile for me to actually get to the jeans versus if I click search here and I start to type in jeans but now see here also the challenges or if I'm on my mobile phone I still have to type this out hit enter or you know it girl and wait for the jeans search results to show up okay and in apparel as you probably have also noticed customers will look at a lot of products before they decide to buy right and you can see here I believe that your jeans have hundred and sixty-one matches so if I let's say now wanted to filter this out or sort by let's say I just want of some some of the cheaper jeans that I want but I have tops lots of tops some hoop rings I can't find the most inexpensive jeans that you have on the site and that is one of the only two sword options available if I wanted to filter now you know a lot of these sizes are mixed in because the results are not just jeans right so it's different sizes different conversions etc and then colour that also is such a important aspect to sort of narrow down the search results so this is the essential challenge if I wanted to just buy the most expensive jeans think about how much work that I have to do here now and that is why probably what mobile experience really looks like in terms of the challenge.,
