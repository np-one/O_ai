Got it so as part of the algorithm that picks up what the customer search for so for example let's say a particular customer has been constantly buying a particular type of products say it's dog products we know that they probably have dogs as a pet so very similar in the grocery example world if I am constantly buying multi packs is it because I have a bigger family etc so we try to create this personalization profiles of customers and try to make sure that the products that we show are based on those profiles and the personalization happens in real time it starts on three different dimensions one is the customer behavior second is the collaborative behavior which is data of other similar customers whether based on geography or whether based on buying patterns or based on seasonality and third is the catalogue behavior which products seem to be selling better which seems to be clicked more added to cart more etc the performance of those products so we combine the data for all three components for each experience for each personalization experience for each customer in real-time.,
