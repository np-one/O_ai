Absolutely you and you we what we'll also do is as part of our integration let's say maybe not for the POC but once we go 100 percent live as soon as we go live there's a process we call holiday testing compatibility tests etc that we do during August and September we will give you our own internal numbers that we've tested for load test index tests etc spikes versus elongated tests etc and we also give you the opportunity if you guys do such load testing on our system so you can also test it and see if you are holiday ready or not for example I'll give you for example Express and some other large retailers during their peak say for example just pic pick up a number an average they might have 10 queries per second at at a peak level what we test our systems at is about 180 queries per second at a spike test and a sustained load test.,
