(a) we give you the ability to define faceting for every category even for an every subcategory (a) say for casual shoes you can define filter you can define attributes in the way you want and then as a user I can come and search for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes men's Nike men's Adidas the results will appear in the same order of attributions and then it's dynamic because if we figure that say an ankle height is more clicked filter than size then ankle height automatically moves up on top.,
