right these are just use cases I was showed about bounce off so that you get some context with the level of customisation we actually get every retailer X all these products it could be the ones this in Express anything happens on the fly and and it's fairly intelligent that way we're safer expensive you want to just look at say dress right on the inventory they don't have dress for men right so you don't see that option for men at all so it is very it specifically pulls up and presents this entire layout for a specific user and it happens dynamic plates it's not temperature driven that way any questions.,
