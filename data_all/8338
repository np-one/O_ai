yeah so we do directly pull content from miva and we can configure it to pull content like three four times a day also if it's required so that's not a problem and once we put all the data we put all of them into a field you basically enable/disable fields or make changes again from your catalog we also list all the filters. if at all you need to edit any filters you can edit it here or if you want to add a new filter it's very simple to add a filter and associate to an attribute and for now you don't have to do anything right. and then synonyms as I repeated myself there's no reason for you to build a synonym for error mistakes or stemmed words we will do it all on the fly if there is some jargon that you want to put it up here you can basically add a synonym create unidirectional bi-directional or a replacement recover into it. just a quick high-level overview right and in the same you can manage your test environment development environment if you have a subdomain you can manage that as well this is just a quick overview of the dashboard on merchandising as we discussed you can merchandise your search you can also merchandise your product pages.,
