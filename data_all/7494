always promote high margin products I always demote accessories maybe say so any any such logic that you would want to run across or across your search queries you can do those here and I'll show you separately in terms of how you get on these rules so let me take an example of a query rule right so say address right again you can define whether you want to and then in this new dashboard what we are doing is we are calling them as campaigns instead of rules I would say because you can also define the time period for how long you want to set these rules right so say for red dress I want to run this for a month so that you don't have to worry about coming in and maybe say editing or deleting this particular rule it's kind of automatically taken care of then you will have a choice who's whether you want to run this rule just for desktop just for mobile or for both desktop and mobile.,
