Again I know this is not from your from your vertical but one kind of show the breadth of the Customization of the solution primarily based on the customer they're the second largest grocery store in APAC and and the then the challenge was they had a lot of repeat visitors people buying same products in there each grocery run right buying fifteen twenty products and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search for these products go to the PDP page Add to Cart and then check out. So instead what we built for them is something like this the moment I start typing in chicken shows me all the options for chicken it shows me the delivery options for chicken gives me the ability to increased quantity right here from search box and Add to Cart right here from search box so on the commonly searched terms popular brands and categories and that the customer can choose from the marketing team starts promoting some of the products by adding banners right here in the search box for this particular category or for this particular query also. Not just that if we added personalization to it because they have a lot of repeat customers say if I was buying chicken nuggets more Often I would see chicken nuggets on top but if you as a customer of buying masala chicken more often and you would see masala chicken on top any questions is this something that you think might help at market.,
