And another example is as I told you its based on the content theme this is for doing alternate product discovery there could be multiple reasons why I like this specific bracelet but there are multiple of such bracelets right. So the best way to do is to show products right below the primary product so that I don't have to go and spend more time in the system looking for similar products but you've already hand-picked five specific products for me. Which are similar to this product I can quickly look at everything in a single fold and then take a decision whether I want to buy this product or not buy this product so this is where our collaborative options start coming in for start showing the cross cell widgets this is what I gave you as an example right. What we do is okay of the ten people who bought a humidifier on my site five of them actually bought a filter right when I start having those metrics with me the moment somebody picks or select humidifier into add to cart we immediately start showing them all the products related to that humidifier so that we help in increasing order value right. The other thing that we do is upsell that we know that of the five ten people who have bought a nail colour two of them actually also bought a lip colour along with it and probably three of them bought the lip colour of the same colour as the nail colour right. So we look at those metrics and start showing this during checkout so that the customer is more likely to add that product and your average order value will also increase this is based on the tag recommendation right.,
