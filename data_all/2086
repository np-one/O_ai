so the first thing that you could do is you have you can reply back to this ticket you have the option to forward this ticket or add a note so let me explain these actions so typically for the straight workflow you will be responding back to this email address to this email that they shot out so they you know he says that he's trying to reach out to look for ordering the length and please give me a call back so you could say sure you know will you please suggest a date and time right and if this happens to be the response that you sent back to your the doctor who sent that out and for you it's going to be part of a ticket thread over here right and now from a customer's perspective for the person who raised this query it will be it will look like a continuation of the same email address that they shot out right so here if you see this was the initial email address which they sent and that came with the response that you sent them up.,
