okay oh yeah you know one of the things that we've seen with customers again is you see that especially in mobile pre people prefer to use search versus navigation in most instances just because it's a lot easier to search for a particular product and and you know like you rightly mentioned you know a lot of consumers don't be you know the same conversion rate and mobile as much as they do in desktop and that's possibly because mobile is still still remains as a research medium right so they come in look for the product see if you have it on the site and then maybe when they when they find some time to get to a desktop with the varieties and then purchase the product in that way.,
