so for Magento I always prefer the hosted way reason being a lot of times what's gonna happen is you put in the unbox plug-in and we will ensure that there are no third party conflicts once unboxd goes in but then you may line up going ahead and putting in some other plugins and then you always have to come back to us because maybe those guys aren't really able to fix them and then you come back to us and then you know there are a lot of times where you are dependent just because you added a new plugin in Magento and I'm sure in Magento one lines of doing that quite often.,
