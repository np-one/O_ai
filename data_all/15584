So before we came in the you so have two different search boxes altogether one for each kind of user or customer on the on the site we came in we said obviously you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so they're now putting the onus on the customer to select the right search box what if they search a wrong search uses long search box and also at the back in your non complicating the problem right of optimizing two different search boxes altogether . So instead what me what we did is design something like this for them the moment I start typing in bissel you'll notice all the parts for the cell on the left hand side all the models for the cell on the right hand side and all the top searches for the bissel on the right bottom.,
