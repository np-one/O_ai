it's similarly for a parts manufacturer the window we have built in is either people come to the site either by a path or look by a model name one we've built them a navigation window where they can actually find any part in three clicks and then from search if I start looking for the cell the way bring this up this on one side you see pipes and one thing you see model names and then you also see cough so just for that specific model so that for a customer it's more visual and guided does this make sense to you.,
