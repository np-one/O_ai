Okay sure I get that Ben and and I completely understand where you're coming from and you would want to do your due diligence right but while you're doing that what I want to want to tell you here and I don't have the metrics on of your site. But if you share the metrics I can actually put on some numbers with regards to what is the kind of revenue that you might be losing every month right. And then if we need to sign an NDA I'm more than happy to sign an NDA execute an NDA and then share a data request sheet if you share that data I can tell you how much you're losing or how much more you can make with Unbxd. And while even you're doing this due diligence rights you can still test us for that 90 90 days POC to see the change by yourself. And while you are doing the due diligence if you find say any other company coming and giving you a better demo than than Unbxd then we are more than happy to do an a/b test again any competition out there because we guarantee a 10% increase over and above any competition out there in the market right. That's what sets us apart so even if you were to talk to five other companies choose one I would come and say if they are giving you a 5% increase we would we would take it to a five point five percent increase right in your overall conversions that's the 10% increase guarantee that we give.,
