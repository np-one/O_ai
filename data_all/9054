It is between Unbxd and ATG the only difference is let's say you are making a call to Endeca either through some object or some API call within the system you make the same type of call to Unbxd and the response that Are nothing gives back to ATG we're looking exactly like Endeca the formatting the content it does look like that we like we like Endeca except for obviously the product because we make to make sure there's a relevant piece set in so ATG doesn't have to look sort of you don't have to do the work onATG site to figure out and say okay now I have to consume this response and figure out how to convert that into how ATG understand will respond in exactly the same way that Endeca does.,
