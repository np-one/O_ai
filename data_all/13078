okay I think that should be good enough for starters so that we can actually start analysing what are the different feeds view on the filters on and you know just make sure we've got all of those things logged before we can actually start implementation in March or maybe if it's April depending on you know when you move to the new platform but I guess be a good start for us just to kind of understand this data a lot better and come up with some filters and the designs accordingly on how they would be working.,
