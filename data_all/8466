I'm not very sure about how how people search in your industry when I looked at few product descriptions and tried to you know tried to search products in various different ways right so I know that you you have some sort of air filter and this comes with an aluminium frame I could see that in the description here when I actually look for aluminium frame air filters these start showing me filters which have an aluminium mesh and not primarily the aluminium frame right. And this is all happening because of a text pattern match right what is this what what the system is trying to do is when search for aluminium frame air and filter all these words one by one right so for say it will first look for all four words then may be the three then two and then one and start showing all the products that have these words in particular. That's one way or sometimes systems also do a minimal match but they do not understand the intent that it's that the customer is actually looking for a product which is air filter and frame is an attribute and aluminium is a material attribute of for that frame right and that is what is important to understand. I look for say black logitech wireless keyboard on on ib supply right it shows me immediately shows me the right set of results or I look for a bright air sixteen point nine ounce spray bottle right very specific product that I am looking for and it start showing me the right set of results. Then I look for some of the features on the site right so I look for a suction catheter with a bulb tip right that's again something that I look at your description and try to find that as as a search but then got zero results same thing on express say someone looking for a full sleeve wear for women or black v-neck for women right more specific I would say product that is being mentioned here. But again it's it's able to the system is able to split this break this query into various different words and understanding that black is actually the color v-neck is the style women is the gender right and that's what someone is looking for and then start showing the right set of results and not showing black shoes for women or black bags for women in that case.,
