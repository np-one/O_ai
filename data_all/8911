You can't do that I can't misspell and I understand and I don't mean to stop you I'm certainly not trying to be rude but we're well aware that this is issue on our site it's just when you go to our product pages it looks for you have to type in exactly what is in the title. Which we know the average consumer is not going to know that a fabric door Bababa is you know what they're looking for so it's like for instance if you type in fabric door you do get a lot of results you get up to five pages because that's their not fabric then some of them are clogged in some chemical drawers. It gets a little confusing but that's when you actually get a fabric drawer pulled up and like I said it's we're a well aware that this is not our site it's not a good place to search a product now you can luckily you can do by product number and it will come straight up so that's nice. If someone person buys a product and they've lost their instruction sheet and they go type in 2875 because that's a wire kit they bought then they can download the instructions but most people that first come to our site that's why we kind of redesign our homepage which we just recently did in the past 90 days.,
