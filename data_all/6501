and on desktop you actually have a hundred and twenty dollars is their average order value so if I come in on mobile and if I see hundred in more than hundred dollars in t-shirts up top how much time do you think customers for mobile are going to spend on your site looking for that cheaper product and it may not necessarily be about being pricing cheap or low it's just that they customers from mobile this tends to be more price sensitive and so they're going to spend a little less so why show them more expensive products high margin products when we know that they're not going to buy right and that's what this data is telling you if if the data tells you that you do have a difference in in terms of how different customers and different devices have different buying patterns show different products to those customers and we did that in that last use case that we showed.,
