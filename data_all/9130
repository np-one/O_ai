Yep and then you can create an entire experience around it also where you can add a banner I'll show you next you can add HTML banner image banner etc and what we're also coming out with is a layout so you can define a particular kind of layout for that page and how you want the customer experience to look like sometimes you have very few products you want to show you don't want filters on the left hand side some times we want to show a content and filters and products together so it depends on how you want it we are coming up with the techniques and the features that will allow you to control different types of layouts as well. And then you hit publish and it's like you can go live instantly or you can schedule it to go live at a particular date and time and this is how you will show you you can create multiple campaigns around just to query interests you can stop the campaign you can delete duplicate we're also coming up with showing you right here in the Box a trend as to how is it doing is it actually going up compared to the previous day going down so you can constantly monitor in one skill to what this particular campaign is doing . Now if you wanted to create custom campaigns you can create that too let's say you wanted to do April clearance. I'm just making this up let's say April clearance I'm going to say test clearance start today it ends tomorrow I'll pick everything again test. Now April clearance is a unique keyword nothing matches in the catalog called April clearance so you won't see any results so you can click here on the left saying create a landing page when you do that you automatically get the entire catalog available for you to curate now. If you can curate based on whatever rules you want to create if that particular products based on that rule is not available at that store it will automatically not show and if it is available it will automatically start to show based on that rule set so you don't have to create rule for every single store you just create your rules and things will fall into place according to whether they are available at that store or not.,
