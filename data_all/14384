This is their home page now parts warehouse actually sells vacuum cleaner parts and other appliance parts now before before they came to Unbxd they used to have two different search boxes on their homepage because they have two different kind of visitors on their site. One who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the model number of the appliance they have and and not the partner right we came in we said obviously you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing this you are now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box. What if they choose the wrong search box also at the back end you are now doubling the problem of optimizing two different search boxes so instead what we design for them is something like this. The moment I start typing in Bissell on the left hand side you will see all the parts for Bissell on the right hand side you will see all the all the models for Bissell and some of the top searches for Bissell. Here is another customer of ours US Patriot Tactical thirty five million dollar company they sell military apparels to US citizens and based out of Texas and let me show you what what we built for them. So say the moment I start typing in Ni right it starts guiding me to Nike one of the most popular brand on their site something that matches with my search query and some of the popular categories within Nike start showing me some some of the popular products for Nike some of the top queries for Nike.,
