yeah I think the first approach we take and we I just learning with large catalogue sites and large InBecka implementations in new egg in US auto where initially I think the first thing to do is to learn to coexist with that system as phase one where there are a bunch of things and Endeca a solar cell system could be connected with which we do probably would not know the magnitude of how interconnected they are so our strength as a platform is relevancy right so we say okay let's solve the relevancy for a problem for you first right and we take it a phased approach where eventually the goal could not be to replace inBecka or solar but it might it might scare a lot of people if we say that on day one right we take it as a phased approach where you have already built so many things already so let's use what you have built let's zoom that customise the platform so that we probably solve a problem like do you want us to only solve your autosuggestion problem today we can only do that and show it to you and then probably move to the next problem to solve or we can solve relevancy problem for you first or we can come and solve a merchandising problem for you so we could take a phase approach the intent here is to at least make sure we get an opportunity to get in and work with you and and then given how your strategy is eventually the platform has all the capabilities that could replace an entire InBecka our system into in and probably do a lot more which is InBecka does not do personalization.,
