ok.   so this was a quick high-level agenda I had prepared for today I wanted to spend a minute or two just to talk about who we are and what we do. then what I've done is I've done a quick site search audit for Digi-Key today and I've tried drawing some parallels with similar customers that we work so that you get an apples to apples comparison and then we can talk talk specifics about the technology behind that and the other features on the product and some of the other verticals that we cater to as well right. so that was a high level agenda so it should essentially take me about 45-50 minutes to go through the entire deck but feel free to stop me if you have any questions.,
