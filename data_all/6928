one of the things I did was try looking at your top hundred organic and paid keywords and find looking for no specific information like Topedo heater parts is one of your top keywords you have the product available but when you search for it you don't find that product then tried looking for again heavy-duty power relays you again have the product available in your category page but when you search for it I'm not sure if it's not available in the inventory or not but when I search for it I did not find that product I so just saw some use cases there where we can come in and improve and we've tried doing that similarly like an exact product or where you for a black logitech wireless keyboard or you for a brighter 169 on spray bottle the intent here is how do you understand what the user is looking for and then in e-commerce context if you're looking for a bright air 169 OZ spay bottle how does your algorithm actually search for that product which keyword here gets what weighted and how does it pull product this is what we've figured out pretty well and I can show you through the technology layer as to how we exactly resolve this internally but what we've seen is with more than 90-95% of the cases we actually come out and return the right results okay. the second thing I tried doing was some feature based searches look for a 42-inch red platform cart where I exactly know what I want called even black chemical-resistant glove size eight it is picking up some relevant products which is good to see but there are also a few products where it's probably displaying a long tail where it's doing an anding or an or-ing at a back end and displaying a bunch of products available.,
