yeah I think that if I could give so that we make contact lenses for eye doctors and so when the eye doctor has a question they may instead of using the form they may email email me and so whether they send just their email client to send me an email or whether the they type a comment on the form on our website that then generates an email to me I would like those emails to come to me so then I know that there's work and items that needs to be an email to me I would like those emails to come to me so then I know that there's work and items that needs to be addressed.,
