right so the next thing I tried doing is those partial number SKUs matches right like this is a product was looking for like what if I exclude one letter here like towards the end in between might still show me a different product but what if I just exclude a letter so what I wanted to see was not whether it's showing me the right product or not as to how the experience of finding such products are doesn't show me options I and I get sorry to nitpick on this but these are some of the things that we've tried doing one is again you start typing a product name a in an opposite experience it preempts a lot of those searches you might be trying to do.,
