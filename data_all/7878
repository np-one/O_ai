Right another thing that I noticed was when I look for a Calvin Klein CK men's perfume right you obviously have more than one perfume on the category page right but when I search for it I only get get shown one single product right is it because I have not spelt the Calvin Klein word in its entirety or if there is something else at the back end which is not letting me show more products I only see one the third thing I look for is I look for something to do with a specific theme.,
