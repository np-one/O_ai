Oh got it so I think that to begin with let's say for example if if caching is important in your minds we could start with just the relevancy piece and the user behavior can kick in slowly for purchase to speak and you guys can then a/b tested or however you guys decide to do a POC you can a/b test and say okay just with cashing involved is Unbxd performing better than what you guys have today and if it does then you can decide and say okay to improve the next level should we probably increase the cash refresh to twice a day or three times a day or one once every hour and then eventually if the performance in terms of the speed with which we are able to deliver results is fast enough then you can start not cashing the search results so you can slowly progress into that state where you can decide and say should we cash or not cash as long as the performance holds as to what your expectations are and obviously from our SLA's will obviously be around 300 milliseconds or less so you know we can slowly progressively go into that state where there's no caching but if you guys obviously want to maintain cache in the beginning this is how we can approach that.,
