I guess so yeah I mean this is definitely a functionality that we want yeah just thinking about like this is the kind of stuff that so this shows up in the search results but what if I want these filters let's say like if somebody clicks on you know those pins like the officer pins or it says club secretary but they in rather than searching for the secretary pin they click on you know In the header they click on pins and then officer pins and they only want to see secretary pins do you guys do the dynamic filters if they're on category pages or is only for search results.,
