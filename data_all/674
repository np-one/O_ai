alright. great. now at the bottom the last section that you see is device section where you can tell you what particular device or what particular platform the user is accessing or using your your platform on so here if it is Android which it means that the user is on your app he is an app user similarly if he is using a website you will see a separate section here called website with similar information when did he first login on the web side and what particular browser he is using and so on so this information as well that you see here the device information this also can be used for segmentation.,
