all right that's the scale a on that scale this not only gets refreshed at the right real time at that moment but your data inside the personalization template which gets posted as events and attributes also replenishes and changes itself as per the users falling in the segment and the triggering also happens at real time so it's not just about the segment data falling into segmented terms of the users moving in and out but the templating engine real-time on top of it which is deeper segmentation and the triggering in terms of if any attribute changes and you have to trigger something in terms of an email SMS or in terms of overlays or any push browser push notifications or app based push notifications that will also happen in real time hence what I'm trying to sum up at is ___  I am supposed to be an automation engine which means once you've created a segment you attached a campaign to it and you've defined a point of trigger all right whatever that might be all of these activities for that particular journey or the user case will happen automatically on its own you just have to sit down and look at the analytics of the campaign happening make tweaks as and when you choose to proactively.,
