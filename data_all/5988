and how we've solved for this problem is one like you know Monal mentioned we've kind of index our catalogue begins you know several thousand catalogues that we call the world catalogue and our technology understands one what the product is and to what the product attributes are and we assign something called as a relevancy game which is which essentially helps you know improve relevancy to a large extent so in this instance the I the tf-idf is the although algorithm which which a lot of such technologies use and if you see here so let's say the example of women's white jeans you would notice that the highest way to design this to women the second highest is to white and and the lowest is to jeans and it technically should be the other way around where jeans is the product from an e-commerce standpoint and and you want to be able to show the right product so using our algorithm what Unbxd has been able to do is assign another rated which on top of it which basically assigns the highest weight edge to the product which is jeans and then to the attributes which is women's and white.,
