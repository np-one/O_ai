so because I know because on the calendar I saw a bunch of people who are supposed to join the call so you know so I'm sure you know they would want to see the system as well so just let me know when when you know that's a good time and you know we could go ahead and schedule the call for the rest of the team and not always if you would you know probably first explained to your team you know as to what you saw on the demo and never the painpoints or other things that you found interesting.,
