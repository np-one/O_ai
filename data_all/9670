So now say sneakers as a category merchandise I can add banners now every time someone searches for sneakers however they search if 75% or more products are sneakers these banners will immediately start showing up. And these filters will automatically start showing you right and here you can come in and say I want price filter on top I want the colour filter on the second position the brand on three. I don't want to show the size filter and hide them the test filter I can hide it right now every time someone searches for sneakers these filters will automatically kick in.,
