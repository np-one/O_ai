so in our system there is no requirement for you to go and build a synonym for any stemmed words any singular plural or any synonym right only you will have to go and build a synonym and we'll give you three ways to build a synonym it would be unidirectional bi-directional or placement if there is something very specific to your industry and I'll show you on the dashboard as to how easy is it for you to build synonym as well right. the other feature that we run in search so we spoke about autocomplete we spoke about relevancy some of the other elements and relevancy these are all finer variations but we believe it will start making the huge difference when you take it as a whole one of them is auto automated redirect right. today you don't have to go and start manually configuring rules where if I look for something which you also have a category with the same name the ideal thing for me to do is to be redirected to the category because that's where I'll find the most relevant search results and this is something that we do in an automated way. another UI element that we manage if I come and search for a specific query on your site especially considering your home decor or if I probably just put on lights on your search box there might be multiple products that might actually match the word lights right.,
