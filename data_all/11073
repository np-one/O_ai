And then Chris I'll schedule this kick off call with my tech team any other questions you have feel free to ask them they will be happy to answer those and if there is a slot available for next Wednesday for about 45 minutes to an hour you can let me know what is that time slot I can make sure that my engineers also will be available for the call. Eric the search data that you spoke about if you can put that in an email I can just prepare the ROI and the contract and email that to you and we can probably have a quick five minute chat in about an hour's time and so that I can just run you through all the clauses so that you understand all of that and then we can discuss next steps.,
