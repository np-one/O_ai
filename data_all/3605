all right so get that's pretty much about how you can set up your set of custom views and of course with the status that you see here so as soon as maybe a customer response back you would have a you know the label coming here telling that you know the customer has responded so in that way something like this so in that way you know that with other tickets that you know you would have to take it up first before you know moving on the others so you have these notifications that keeps coming in too.,
