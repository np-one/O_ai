So 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box you do not have to create any kind of dictionary entry synonym entry library none of that has to be created 85 90 percent of the time out of the box it will get solved. Same thing with stemming wine glass versus wine glasses you again have to create a solve for that you again have to create a synonym library on the back end to say glass and glasses are the same thing. You do not have to do that with Unbxd also you do not have to same like spell check no need to create a synonym library on the back end 90 in stemming cases almost 95% of stemmed words are automatically solved out of the box by Unbxd hence the word company name became Unbxd it's like how much can we do out of the box. Okay the third thing is automatic redirection a lot of times what we've noticed is that say customers came to the site and they searched exactly for candles now if I search for candles today it takes me to an actual search results page. But sometimes you might have created a very compelling layout and experience for candles because it's candle season let's say for example and you want customers to actually go to that candle category page. There's two ways to solve that one is if it is a one-off case we do give you the ability to create redirects but if you always wanted to redirect the customer where the search term matches the taxonomy we automatically do that too you do not have to create those rules on the back end will automatically take care of it.,
