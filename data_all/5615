yeah and I think you know one of the key things like we talked about you have the recommendation is but I think the idea is this is such a visual business you know Philips looking at flowering trees and stuff I want to make sure my recommendations are still visually appealing and you know even from a design perspective we can do a lot of things so I try to make sure that they their focus is on the actual just on the product rather than getting distracted from from anything else because recommendations when if a customer let's say has an intent they might look at some of the details but the first thing that they might if they don't have an intent it might get attracted to look at is based on the actual product image.,
