You use both so similar to the amateur Google Analytics tag we will also deploy our own tags on the site so we we capture the real-time analytics using our own our own analytics tracking and we capture every single track every single click so you have views click Add to Cart orders etc and that real-time data gets fed back into the system which again starts to calculate in view and that's where the personalization component comes in this is where the personalization component comes in . Where while collaborative piece you know ten customers Are clicking on that land o lakes which is the 15th in the result set so we'll start to percolate the 15th products to the first position slowly and the 11th customer comes in and starts to click on that 12th product we start to make sure we try to track everything in real time to start showing that product up top also but to on top of that that's the collaborative piece but on top of that we also do personalization where I come in and I'm always buying the some other brand of butter I can just seem to remember which one which are the one but not the Land O'Lakes I'll start to see that butter up top instead of the Land O'Lakes specifically for me. And there's a lot of techniques on personalization yes we there's we you be very priority algorithm we look at what customers are clicking on is there a few keep affinity to a brand affinity to category affinity to in terms of pricing so there's a lot of techniques that we used but in grocery there's so much repeatability that there's very strong signals that when they buy something one time there's high probability to buy that again unless it was a very seasonal item so those times those types of classifications is something that we do to understand which products were actually consider for personalization and which ones to not. Right and then we also do you know and then these personalizations are by the way attract not just as an individual level but also as a collaborative levels by geo it's not just entire sites for everybody if we can we do and can group them within geo locations as well and then we also do.,
