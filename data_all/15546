So the first thing first thing I looked at Colleen on your website was the autosuggest when I start typing in something it's important to start guiding the customer to the right categories to the right brands to the right popular products the moment they have typed in the first few alphabets on the search bar right and I see the absence of autosuggest today I'll show you how we do this for all of our customers and approach this in a very different way. Then I look at at the site for error tolerance try to do a few mistakes and then see if the system was to auto corrected spellcheck doesn't work curriculum jewelry then I try to misspelled beanies and couple of different ways did not work bottles with the single T did not work. Then I look for search relevance tried for t-shirt the first few are hoodies and then tried for jackets the first few products are some of the products are not even jackets there's some sort of patch and that could be probably be put on jacket but not the actual jackets. Then look for pen again is a lot of products not been secretary pen the signatory club pen actually doesn't show up.,
