so generally when they look for we walk through there for this head queries and a carrot or a spinach and if you actually have a category page by default we take them to a category page because category pages are generally more accurated unless you don't want us to take take them go category page there is no category page available save sliced carrots right there's probably no category page available right then if you don't have anything to do with sliced carrots for a first time user on your site in month one right of our implementation or day one of our implementation where the machine learning has limited data on how people buy products on your site it let me show them carrots might not show them sliced carrots but when somebody looks for slides carrots right and they go through a specific path on the kind of products they click to eventually reach sliced carrots that entire information is that product and so when somebody else comes in look sliced carrots it will actually start pulling up the data and start showing the more relevant products so our ultimate aim is to show the most relevant products on top and then the long tail is something that you could work on you could also set up merchandising rules which I'll also take you to the dashboard itself as to what kind of rules you can also set to show products but our intent will be to show the most relevant products but I will not get into situations where we not show any products at all I will still show something which is loosely loosely relevant if nothing is available at all but we'll try and pick up from machine learning one of the things we started doing now is especially to start the code stop the code stop problem we also inject last three months analytics from a system so that there is some way that we can jump-start the machine learning algorithm and also when we start implementing we generally takes four to six weeks to go live but the first week itself we install analytics on a system so that at least the machine learning starts realising and understanding how people are going through buying behaviour on your site so that you can start being more relevant from day one sorry for the long answer but I just want.,
