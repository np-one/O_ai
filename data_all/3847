Italy when freshdesk which is our parent product our primary product was there in the system and first sales was initially brought in as an internal tool to satisfy the sales requirements itself however when our freshdesk sales team I was continuously going bigger by the day and at one point of them when we crossed around 120 salespeople for freshdesk alone we had to you know we move on from an existing tool who we were dependent on so earlier we were using Salesforce ourselves but how we're considering you know the cost of the CRM cost of Salesforce and also how complex it was even to perform simple operations we had to move on to an internal tool and fresh sales was initially used internally alone and then was later used and release to the public market around 14 to 15 months before and it's been in the system for a year and a quarter .,
