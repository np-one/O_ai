and just this was a quick check we did on the relevancy so we did use multiple kinds of queries use some product type queries look for fresh juices or meat alternatives right essentially this is how your navigation displays these products this is how the search results come up it's not about this being correct or incorrect it's about the experience that someone would get when they actually get into a navigation section even in a fresh juice or you have actually mute alternatives if actually you can filter it down and you have products relevant to that but when I search for it probably the essential context of water fresh juices or meat alternatives is not thoroughly captured and that's why you find inconsistencies and results of somebody searching for that product versus somebody going through the browser functionality right and then if I look for sliced radish again you have the similar allegations section but essentially when you search for radish this is showing me cheese it's probably looking at the word sliced which is probably there in one of these product detail pages and hence showing that cheese which is sliced and probably not essentially radish and this is what you'll typically find in most search implementations because it's either using an and-ing or an or-ing what we've built is a complex excel function which helps it understands the context a little more better right .,
