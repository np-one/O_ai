Let's say Alexander Wang makes different categories of products tote bags dresses sandals pants etc I want to show all the products but I still want to guide the customer so I'll show tote bags you scroll horizontally you can see all tote bags you scroll vertically and you start seeing all shoulder bags. And this is another way to really combine the technology in the UI to make sure we are guiding the customer right because someone could come in and say I am looking for bedroom furniture now within bedroom you have so many different categories subcategories. How do you just throw everything in front of the customer you actually wants them to be picking out and say oh maybe I want accent furniture maybe I want beds or I want lamps etc right. Next is spellcheck and so before I get into spellcheck I know Shannon you mentioned that today and you don't actually have the time to look at if customers are making spelling mistakes or not.,
