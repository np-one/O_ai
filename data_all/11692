So these are the four themes in which our entire recommendation platform is built and we've had algorithms and collaborative filtering options which are all free built into the platform so what you have to do is just install installing those widgets and the tracking device. And then where the widget has to be shown what widget has to be shown at what stage of the user experience this is all something which is completely managed by our big data system so there is nothing that you will have to actually do it the backend manually at all. The system will be intelligent enough to start understanding there are a few widgets which I'll show you where probably we need some inputs business inputs from you so that we can do the right looping of products initially. But otherwise it's a very very self learning system which should every passing week starts being much and much better which when it starts showing the right kind of recommendation and one thing which you can also do I'll have to figure with core metrics if we have a connectivity available. Generally if it's Google Analytics what we do is we A consume the Google Analytics data so that even if we are starting a product recommendation platform today we look at at least I'll have six months data consume that data and basically in a very layman's term train the system with that data so that it becomes more and more intelligent from the day one it actually gets started.,
