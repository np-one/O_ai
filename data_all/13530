next is variances so let's say here I was searching for red dress and you have that same image for a dress in four different colors let's say it's in black blue green and red and black might be the primary image but you want to show the red image of that dress instead of the black image right so we also solved that problem the problem we solve is the color synonyms so if you let's say have in your catalog something called a red dress but a customer searches for a crimson dress you automatically show crimson first if you have crimson if you don't have crimson we'll show red instead.,
