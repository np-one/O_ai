That's correct and maybe that's one of the reasons kind of from a business perspective you guys end up seeing a lot of zero results is because the definition is quite strict So you must have those keywords just start showing results Okay so let me explain to you why solar or some other solutions like in deca behaves the way that behaves So when I search for women's white jeans there's a algorithm called tf-idf which is considered a gold standard in search which is used to actually provide the search results So how does tf-idf work just to assume let's say for women's white jeans I get these four results and the numbers in the red are the tf-idf scores for these products Now why does a white top have a higher idf score than jeans it's because a tf-idf only gives you either popularity or the rarity score it does not give you any usefulness score which is extremely important in e-commerce So what Unbxd has done is we've tried to solve this problem by creating another layer on top of tf-idf called the relevance gain What relevance gain gives us is the usefulness it gives us the contextual relevance that we're at searching for women's white jeans what is more important So here you can see when say women's white jeans as a query gets broken down an idf score might give jeans or women's a little higher score maybe because it's more rare and then white and jeans but we know that in e-commerce jeans is the most important word then women's and then white So this is what Unbxd does we create another layer called the relevance gain to recalculate what's the most important keyword So now what happens is because of that we'll be actually able to show white jeans at top but this still creates a problem where the white top still exists in the search results So this is where we do these second piece step 2 which is the search results exclusion where we have scanned almost a hundred thousand e-commerce site created a catalogue of almost two hundred and fifty million products and we've trained our algorithm to actually understand what a product is and what a product attribute is So here we understand that when somebody searching for women's white jeans that jeans is the product white is the color attribute and women's is the gender attribute So now we know that if we have in our search results white tops because it might say you know this white top goes great with jeans or this women's white top goes great with jeans so we get all those keywords but at the end of the day that product is still a top and not a jeans So we'll exclude those tops and essentially we'll remove the white top and push more white jeans on top okay Any questions on those first two steps gentlemen So thats what it essentially defines our secrets as to how are we able to solve relevancy problems using contextual relevance rather than just text pattern match No questions.,
