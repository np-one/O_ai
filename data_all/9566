But on the first fold you'll see a lot of a lot of these products are not relevant then I look for quadcopters I could I could see a lot of quadcopters I think you had one category multirotors or somewhere I was able to see a lot of quadcopters. But when I do this I again get a lot of non relevant results here this is important the first two images are broken right you would not want to show products without images on the first fold. Then I look for rc boat one of the categories that you have on the site when I go to that category page of rc boats I find really nice looking rc boats out there but when I search for it again gives you a lot of you know various different products which are surely not relevant.,
