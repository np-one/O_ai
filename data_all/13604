if there are some special circumstances where Unboxd has no idea how to correct the spelling because it's a unique keyword you can always solve it by creating a synonym on the back end you can go here <> synonym and say that say a particular keyword for example like cellular may get caught up as it's misspelling so you might want to say keyword is synonym is mobile that's it and if you have more than one you can you can add more than one to say seen,
