I can even search for men's Nike or men's adidas doesn't even have to have the word shoes in it the filters will automatically show up in the right order of importance for that particular category of products next is variance actually if this is truly applicable to you guys but I just included that in here as well sometimes customers will search for different variances in the query and you if you have the image for that variance you automatically show the image for that variance rather than just a primary image.,
