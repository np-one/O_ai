So you can create continue to create that experience and not have to worry about if products change inventories change etc you can also do pinning you can do specific products find a specific product and say I have this particular product I want to show up in a regular position. You can do that as well I'll just quickly skip over there we go so if you go to pinning you can either find this and find the particular product by anything saying by item ID by SKU by description whatever and you can define and say this I want this particular product in this position. And you can pin that particular product drag and drop easily and show that and then you basically publish it and as soon as you publish it based on the day time either it becomes available in a real time or it will be scheduled for the day and time that you wanted to actually go live. And this is available both for search and category pages and or I should say any questions alright.,
