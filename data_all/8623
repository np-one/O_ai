We used yeah it's it's been a horrible experience for us in the past and and we same sort of conversation we've had to clean up taxonomy the challenge with was the stemming is because we weren't consistent across the website the stemming experience was awful and so you know there was the source which was used for the synonyms the stemming is built into a little bit of the way that we build our taxonomy but we need to expand that so we've been developing our own database of synonyms and will you actually we can use the database within IBM to really you to take that stemming and build it out as a as a look-up on search. And it's not too much penalty.,
