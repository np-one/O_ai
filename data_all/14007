no no got it so the idea behind is what we call is the framework piece talk about the technology business and frameworks the framework component is exactly that because search is not a one-and-done solution it is a ongoing work in progress our technology enables you to get to a certain point let's say York today at 50% and we take you to 85% out of the box but we want to go to 95% that activity to go to 95% is a collaborative work you know your business better than we do but we know extremely well how search functions and what we need to do to make search work really well so collaboratively on a weekly monthly and quarterly basis will work with you interact with you in say a scale this is what we see we're able to see these queries and here's some issues we're able to solve those issues automatically here is some issues we're seeing we're not able to solve those automatically because we have some context that's missing from a business perspective and then you can provide the guidance and you can say got it let us give you this data to solve that or why don't you guys do this and that will be a good solution for this particular problem and then we'll go ahead and implement the solution solve it or get the new data and it will the system will be able to automatically solve it.,
