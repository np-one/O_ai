Thanks Ashish perfect and so just to kind of jump into the customer experience study we put together so what we do normally is we assess your you know so this is mostly from a site standpoint where we kind of look at the relevancy aspect of your site search we look at you know whether how good your auto suggests is if you have an autocomplete because we feel that that's important to kind of help guide the customer to their to their shopping journey we also look at synonym system words and error tolerance to see how your search responds if let's say someone were to misspell a specific query or if if someone looks for a synonym which is not really on on your catalog and and the last piece is also we apply all of the above from a mobile standpoint to see how you know you search performs on a mobile device.,
