Merchandiser can simply drag and drop and pin a product to a particular location like I can pin this and position one pin this one position two or position four right and now if there are too many products to drag and drop what he or she can do is just do a slotting where say positions 5 to 6 are always want say Ralph Lauren brand to show up because it gives me the largest margin some estimate right So Ralph Lauren products will show on top.,
