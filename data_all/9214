Then the next thing I looked at on the side was stemming could be singular plural words could be same words with spaces in between a print head versus print head with a space the intent of the customer does not change they're probably looking for the same product but the experience delivered is is different the number of products that they are seeing 698 versus 455 the number of products are different the order of these products is again totally different. I looked at Eddi square printers having Eddi square is one of the brand that you have on the site try to look for Eddi sqaure with space and without space again with space was a zero result page delivered without the spaces it's really worked well.,
