Typically we don't do a month-to-month contract but if you did do a month-to-month contract then the the per month charge would go up about 30% so we don't typically do that this is because we you want to see you want the you want the product to really work you want the product to be in for a period of time.  Because after those 90 days you're gonna see the conversions go up dramatically and you're gonna see the increase in revenue go up but so you want to kind of keep that baseline and have that continued growth I mean only month-to-month.,
