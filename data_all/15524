Well that is probably what I'm talking to you right now so our timeline we have a few things that are that are some moving pieces the first one is actually getting Shopify approved as a vendor and getting that membership started which we just completed last week after a long and arduous process so we're on board with Shopify 100% we've evaluated bigcommerce and Volusion and a few other ones and Shopify is the best bet given our limited or zero in-house development that we have. The next step is we have a product in a ERP integration so we use say math 500 to do all of our like inventory and order fulfillment and all that stuff and I'd love to get rid of mass but our whole organization we're not just an e-commerce company we have a conference center and fundraisers and everybody uses mass so if we weren't on mass the whole thing would fall to pieces. So we have to be on mass so we've selected eBridge connections to do the integration between Shopify and mass 500. The work on that is set to start fairly soon I think we actually just made our first payment maybe today so I think the timeline that is six to eight weeks and supposedly when that connection is built the all of our products will show up on in the Shopify admin. Now they're not going to have all the product descriptions and the images and all that stuff but they're going you know they're gonna be our products will be there in the backend supposedly I yet to see if that's actually gonna happen but that's how it's supposed to work because one of the data feeds is from ERP 2 to Shopify for product information so we shall see what happens there so that work is six to eight weeks. And so we're looking at probably starting that Thursday so realistically we won't start that till next week and let's just say eight weeks for the sake of you know giving ourselves plenty of time so that's October no it's September November like the week of November seventh right so that's what we're looking at .,
