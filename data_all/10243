and another thing I want to talk about Stacy David was you know the stemmed words right things like accessory versus  accessories the results shown were completely different because if but if you look at it as a user my intent is not changing this was just one simple example I pulled up but the intent here is I could spell anyway I want a like it could be a singular word or a plural word or things like wood wooden center central essentially the user intent is not changing so the experience that you show should also not change like I've tried using some snapshots.,
