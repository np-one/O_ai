So let me go to some used cases that I found on the site right so I looked at some product specific queries when I look for pregnancy test kits on the site right this is what I searched for but if you also have a navigation page which has a specific order of listing for these pregnancy kits and there is an order in which they're listed but if you look at search they're extremely different from how you would actually show up on a category page right some of the things are also not very relevant to what you would actually find and I'll show you this I'll send you this report you can actually review this in more detail right.,
