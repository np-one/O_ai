But first surfaces page what starts happening is you start serving or rendering just the header and the footer and give us an empty div tag wherein we start rendering the results through HTML in real time right these are all ajax-based results. So this is this section of the site right starting from search from here till here is something which is rendered by the cus by Unbxd there is the header and the footer is something that's rendered by the customer. And all of this happens within 500 milliseconds and 90% of our queries respond within I would say 200 milliseconds and then anything below 500 milliseconds is actually not even visible to human eye as per rule. So our SLA are very strong out.,
