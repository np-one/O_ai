umm from from you guys I think that I honestly we should probably put our any work you guys do on hold until I just don't want you guys to end up working on something and then have to wait until like I don't know March or April to do anything which I mean I'll still sending over the catalogue if you guys want to evaluate it but we're not going to be doing the integration piece at least until March because our map doesn't like the accounting system needs to be updated and what if the integration is going to be done the catalog is going to be done whether it's on Shopify or bigcommerce until then or whatever we end up and once we do that then I'd rather have you guys go in and then we can start evaluating but I'll still sound over our existing catalogue just so you can get an idea of the breadth and depth of products we have as you said but I think that in terms of doing any more work on your end right now we have to get our own ducks in a line on the requirements and all that other stuff that I'd rather make sure we're good to go before I tell you guys to go and then we have to backtrack or change what we've done.,
