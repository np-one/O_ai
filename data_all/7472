I mean for us or for our industry so the ones that are that are most relevant are really a category or the type level so what people also pop is kind of interesting but somebody who does it pretty well is winecom as an example sometimes you go to SKU level you know there's they'll make recommendations that are based off of either geographically where they're from or you know the type and then maybe you know mess however puns but but they're actually relevant to some of the items that you're looking at in some way you know so.,
