I'm not even that far along yet I'm still trying to understand how we would you know fit it in and I actually have not presented my 2017 plan yet to our leadership team so you know we're still working through what we're gonna do next year and I think that would be solidified till January or February anyway so it would probably not be you know the beginning of the year for sure Okay yeah that's obviously good context so let me do this I'll forward you the implementation document and also I will send you some sample pricing information so you do have a reference on that and then we <> from your side if you want us to do a tech call with any of your developers to them to understand what's involved we're happy to schedule those things.,
