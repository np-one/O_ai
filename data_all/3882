and further that is pretty much with the leads and contacts because leads and contacts page are exactly similar you have the follow up stages in the leads as I was showing you you have the follow up stages in the leads and in the contacts page instead of the follow up stages that you have in the leads you just have the deal value itself so you just have the deal value so as soon as you have a lead you can actually go ahead and click convert so let us say this is a person who is really interested in your product and he is in the lead stage so you can click on convert and convert the contact lead into a contact by just assigning a deal probably just give a name to the deal such as you know on a golden plan over the golden plan give any name and then associate the deal with the deal value give your custom fields you can make fields mandatory as well and then click convert so what this is going to do is create a contact it will automatically create an account with the name that you given and also create a deal with the deal value we will give and with multiple pipelines in the system you can also have different teams working on the system so let's say you have an inbound team and an outbound team you can have different pipelines and different sales process for your teams as well I will skip the accounts part because every four this is because the accounts part is really simple it's just the account and the account information itself and you also have the related contacts so that you know you can just search by a search by n account and then go into the account and then click on the contacts to take you to the contacts page itself.,
