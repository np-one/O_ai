So big basket dot com the second largest grocery store with them what was what was the challenge was they had a lot of repeat visitors who used to buy 15 to 20 products in each and every interaction they used to do on the site and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search go to the PDP page and Add to Cart for these products. So instead what we built for them is something like this the moment I start typing in say let me do chicken you see all the chicken options here shows you the delivery options how fast it can be delivered gives the ability to increase quantity and Add to Cart right here from search box on the right hand side start showing some of the commonly searched terms popular brands some of the categories. Not just that within within the search terms here but we have done is added personalization to it meaning if I as a buyer if I'm buying masala chicken more often I would see masala chicken on top but if you are buying nuggets chicken more often you would start seeing nuggets chicken on top right Add to Cart actually helps a lot of b2b customers as well.,
