okay so this is the the setup fee this is the monthly before the performance this is if we reach the performance now the only and you can see here if we divide this by two thousand this is merely if you if you were to incrementally sell one extra arrangement it will pay for itself per site right for the whole year.  I'm assuming that that's you typically the price point but now I understand that from a margins perspective it may require a couple of more arrangements to be sold but I wanted to put that in the context primarily because the effort that will that it will take for us on the back end.  because it's not this one if you remember Alan the big conversation we had the big trouble for us is this maintenance of this 2000 sites we've simplified it significantly and brought the price down because we're standardizing the front end and we're standardizing the back end where the catalogue is exactly the same right.  so we have this one monolithic catalogue that allows you to be able to come to this the the old so this price point is very hard for me to reduce down to just because of that the volume and the usage aspect of it the integration we can be flexible in it.  in the sense that if that is a big number to begin with we can take some of that and put it in here and spread it for the first year if you wanted to.,
