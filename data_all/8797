Can merchandise or create rules this is where you can create global rules say all this promote home brand always demote out of inventory products are your inventory products those are the kind of rules any rule that is applicable to all your search queries can be set here let me take a example we see the black dress the first black dress the two blue dresses in the striped dress on the life site today when we search for dress and I come back here on the merchandising dashboard you see the replica of your site black dress the two blue dresses and they and the stripe dress right the same thing that we are seeing on the site. The same office site these this is the 90% experience that I spoke about all our dresses these are not shoes or jackets and they are relevant and they are also based on the popularity based on the user behavior based on the relevancy of the of the query but your merchants might want to come in and control this by running various different rules. They can now start coming come in and say start filtering these results based on any of the elements by brand by category you are buys a color or say run promotions boost sought slot. Let me show you an example I want to boost a particular brand all this for this particular query. So brand contains Eliza you see all the Eliza products on top now right even within this you this dress is the latest survival on the catalog I want this on position one this dress is going out of season I want this in position two so that I can get rid of the inventory drag and drop now. Every time someone looks for a dress as a query these two products will always be on top this was a product level placement let me show you how you can do a product catalog attribute level placement so say slotting position five to six I always want dresses from a particular brand which could be Ralph now the fifth and the six products are the most popular Ralph Lauren dresses even if this just goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next popular Ralph Lauren dress.,
