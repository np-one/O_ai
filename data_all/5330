in your particular case while the focus will participant had 72 percent usage of search box when the intent was clear when you look at maybe at a broader scope the percentage of site search might actually go a little bit lower because of the way the search is positioned so in this focus group it seemed like it was 72% I think in general our experience will tell me there will be more closer to 65% towards the low end of the spectrum when the intent is extremely clear.,
