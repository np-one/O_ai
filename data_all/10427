great because you have tremendous amount of traffic on the site the historical data is good to have but it's not necessarily a requirement so I don't necessarily create work for you guys but let me check with my team if the history is important and if you can share that's fantastic I don't wanna necessarily create work but if you deploy the analytics beforehand going forward and in a couple of days I think depending on the traffic we should be able to start providing recommendations.,
