so I'll give you a simple example let's say we talk about shoes so on shoes as a category you can come in and say I want to show size ankle height width shoe type etc in that order but I can search for shoes in a thousand different ways so I could search for shoes they have choose and choose men's casual shoes right you cannot go in and set this manually for every single variation so this is something unbxd solved where you set it up once for the category Unbxd will automatically scale that to no matter how the customer can search for that category.,
