well so results are gonna be different oh sorry I got digress there so here if I go to if you go to browse and let me open my demo site so here let's see if I went to men's section hey there's one of your net taxonomy pages and it's gonna be faster that's clear it's going to show these products that's also clear the second thing what you have the ability to do is actually manipulate the results based on what you want so you can now come in and say I want to sort the results based on any parameter that you collect for example you already might have a preference in terms of performance you can create your own ranking for the products so based on that ranking you can sort for the voyage that's how we will give you the results so all your team has to do is render the results but you get to control from here in a more user-friendly dashboard and it's obviously simpler so you can filter the results you can promote you can create a lot of customized marketing stuff when you come in so say I want to boost it for this time I don't want to boost something very quick manipulation from here and then you can show it like you're and then it's faster hopefully it's faster I think you can ask Malaysian team to say try try this and then see is it faster if it's faster than you want to go and use it if it's not then you certainly other than the benefit of using the dash board don't want to necessarily you know do that.,
