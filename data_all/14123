okay yeah because you know for instance like Express after he became a customer we did an audit for them and and you know we figured out that a simple word like jumpsuit could be misspelled about 216 times people would come in and type in jumpsuit and you know maybe a typo maybe a different way of maybe you synonym exactly there are 216 ways of you know finding jumpsuits and and the other so the other piece to the technology itself is we were able to essentially fix the relevancy also from spellcheck aspect to fit but you don't have to go on the back end and build out synonyms where you know it's it's pretty much taking away all of that manual labour and we were able to solve for that 90% of the time.,
