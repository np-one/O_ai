yeah all right so I'm okay so the first thing that we implement as part of the search solution is the auto  suggests when a user starts typing in something I'm not sure you have any others just give you an idea a few different design layouts that we have auto  suggests let me just okay so I am also gonna be sending in a few different autosuggest layouts in an email to you but I just want to kind of explain the different elements that we have in this autosuggest so if you see this first autosuggest so this is a two-sided autosuggest what we have here is one we have something we call the guided search then we are categorizing the data that user is typing in based on categories Bronks subcategories or anything else which defines these products a lot better for you based on your product catalog so it just lets the user jump into the right category of data directly from the autosuggest itself so when you in this case it's an apparel example it could be based on categories where someone says t-shirts and the parallels and men's t-shirts top pairs or could be something like a brand or a manufacturer way of saying t-shirts you my and Nike and so on and when someone goes ahead and clicks on any of these they are directly taken to filter page where this brand is already pre-selected so this helped and guided search then we have something we call the popular products which is essentially taking into consideration popular products for that specific query so this keeps changing in real time based on the data and then we have a top query section which again takes into account the real time talk queries coming in on the side so these are the actual search queries been made by the users so this is data coming in directly from there and then we have the keyword suggestions this is something can be controlled from the backend you can define whether you want a combination of let's say color plus category or gender plus subcategory or you know anything of those just coming up with the right combinations based on the search queries that we've seen coming onto your site in the back so based on that data we actually come up with these contributions.,
