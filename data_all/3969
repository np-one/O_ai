So the way we solved for this use case is if I start typing in chicken water you would notice is I get options to change quantity and add the product to the cart right from the search box. Plus I give them a banner option to put any sale items that's there for something starting with CH IC plus I show them all the commonly searched terms for something starting with CH IC. Plus all the popular brands of chicken and all the categories of chicken right this way the customers can add products to cart very very fast. And beyond this what we've also done is if I am a user who buys chicken without skin chicken without skin shows up to me on top and if you are a user who buys chicken with skin chicken with skin actually shows up to you on top.,
