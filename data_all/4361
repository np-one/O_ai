Great so the next thing that I looked at on your site was error tolerance then I tried to make spelling mistakes right typical behavior when people are coming from smaller screens or even for from say desktop or laptop and they're trying to type fast they tend to make mistakes right so I try to stimulate simulate the same behavior making few spelling mistakes cell phones with a single L it starts giving me irrelevant results with and with <Endeca> today the onus is on the customer right on you to start looking at the most misspelled queries and then configure these at the back end start creating redirects all of these libraries to correct these queries next time right at that point in time the customer has had a bad experience of searching and it can only be corrected till you know when when someone looks into it and corrects it for the next time but with us what we have done is built a technology and algorithm that is able to automatically correct misspelled queries of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.,
