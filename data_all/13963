so for example when I'm searching for women's like jeans that will know that jeans is a product white is the colour attribute and women's is a gender attribute so it ends up excluding white tops because it understand that white top is not Jane so we removed white tops out of the search results and if there are more jeans beyond that we'll start to show them up top the third component we do is the machine learning team this is where we look at the user behaviour and start ranking the results based on the better performing product so we track every single click stream data and provide a score for that query or every single product and based on that scoring we actually reorder the results based on what's really performing well .,
