absolutely so not only from an automation perspective so you can set up a rule to say if there's two types of products right products will go out of inventory that you're never going to restock you don't want to show them let's say for example and there are some problems that go out of inventory that you know are coming going to be restocked pretty soon if there are different kinds of flags like that we can automatically not show out of stock are never going to be stocked products and we can bury or demote the products that are going other out of stock and will be a restock right so the idea is you have tremendous amount of control at a global level and at a category level and at a query level on top of that so that's this inventory so.,
