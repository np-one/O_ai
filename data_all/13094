the outcome is going to be typically the same one both the platforms because you know it's the implementation being done by unboxed and we provide an in page Ajax implementation on both the platforms it's just that yeah implementation as a process may take longer and may be you know not as clean as it could be on Shopify that's the only difference but the end result we can do it on both.,
