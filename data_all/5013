and this is another and users were happy but one thing is users like seeing that color variation basically if you have three different colors in the inventory actually giving the user those three different colors to see which is good good to have feature and what we've also done with unbox this instead of waterproof shoes if I basically say red waterproof shoes and if you have a red color waterproof shoe available  in inventory and say five different designs when we show these results like like you see it here the three results that you show scene which is shoes you will see the red color two different design and you do not see another color which we are trying to make it more relevant for the image and then people who use navigation basically went through these category pages but what they did not find was those specific filters which will help them narrow down the search because when you go through navigation and go through category you will find a broad verity of products filters help them refine their search and  also give them an indication in your inventory so that is something that people thought to be good to have feature.,
