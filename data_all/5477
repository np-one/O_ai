okay all right so this first name is Prada discovery stage so the idea here was three tasks task one with highly specific the first task was by I'm assuming cloak limb or climb snow boots and you know the customer response was seven out of 25 participants used navigation to find a product 18 out of 25 actually used side search to find these products so you just pointed out that they could see that the product same product categories were repeated as part of the autosuggest autocomplete suggestions so this was for those customers who were using the search functionality for example they were saying instead of showing to millions of cats and two meters of pans they could have shown us an assorted products or sort of discovered new products however when you're starting to type in the brand you can actually show that it's not just individual products that there are categories within the brand that you actually sell right it's not just six or seven products that you sell so that was one of the biggest opportunities that we found on the site other than some of these are some of the other aspects where customers felt that they had to wait and type in at the entire keyword to actually get the right sort of product versus the site actually helping them and guiding them to what might be available through the site.,
