So this is a quick background on who we are so the second thing I wanted to talk about was the quick study that we did on Walgreens site today right and when we talk and I'll share this report with you and when we talk about a commercial study what we've done is we've tried going through the entire experience of finding a product on wall Walgreens dot com and when we talk about the entire experience we talk about the first interaction your customer would have with the search box which is the autofill functionality how is your error tolerance today how do you manage synonym detection today how you good on relevancy and how ready is the site for mobile or for search on mobile so we've gone through the entire five elements and we've given you specific snapshots that we found on the site today which we believe could be improved right.,
