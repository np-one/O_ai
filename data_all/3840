I'm good I mean good mean obviously we're familiar with the interface and everything they obviously some of the other features and capabilities is important because you know we're new to this and we know there's a lot more that we could be taking advantage of and we're not so that be part of a follow on call with bottom that her Gotham excuse me that you know would be helpful that you create a plan and how we could start not only cleaning up what we have but then taking advantage of these other features and even to the point where you know like I said you know we have a contact club contact center solution but if we can link something in very quickly and seamlessly even on the CRM side then you know the team members on the call here I'm sure would appreciate that where they make a call attracts everything when inbound call comes in that's also tracked without having to do any extra data entry and effort that um but certainly from a support standpoint and I think I'll sit down with the Savannah and Amanda and figure out how we can get more efficient with what we've seen.,
