correct so Alan there's two parts to this I want to make sure so conversion is absolutely important because that's what the dollars and cents will come down but you also want to make sure that there are other KPIs.  for example if let's say the customers are clicking on a search results so they're finding what they need but they're not buying because the price point might be too high or or once they find what the product actually contains they may not be interested in.  so we also want to make sure that we don't get penalized based on a particular approach that at that time pedals might have taken where the prices are high or you know what I mean it's not seasonal.,
