Great so another important thing is as to why search right essentially that's one of the roles I play as to look at trends as to how people are taking product discovery seriously like if you look at even say 24 months ago most of the heads of marketing and e-commerce would have probably not put search as the top three priorities in their entire stack for the year but what has changed in the last 12 months especially as A the percentage of traffic through search has anywhere being between 30 to 40 percent for most retailers in mass merchants in marketplaces and fashion and apparel it's a lot higher but what has changed significantly is the percentage conversions on search is sometimes 2X of site conversions.,
