You cannot manually go in and order the facets for every single query that's manually impossible to do so this is what Unbxd has also solved what we have done is we give you the ability to ways one even through data or one if you as a merchant know exactly what you want. To come in and say for example let's the shoes I have shoes for shoes as a category I want to show size first then ankle height then width then shoe type you said at at once it doesn't matter how I search for shoes shoes casual shoes men's shoes men's casual shoes. These filters in that order will automatically show up it doesn't even have to have the word shoes in it it could say men's Adidas men's Nike and these filters will automatically show up. If you have completely different category called say shirts completely different sets of filters and a different order set it up once it will automatically start showing those filters in that order whenever you search whenever the customer searches for shirts no matter how they search for shirts.,
