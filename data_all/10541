got it perfect the next approach which is approach B this is where you will have to do a little bit more work but definitely puts you more in control of the search page etc for any changes that you make and this is where you know obviously all the search relevancy configurations will be done by us once we get the catalog of any kind of tuning that still is done by us regardless of which approach you take then here's the api's for different pages or different sections within the search page where you have a Search API you have facets and filter api's and you have sorting and pagination api's right so again this is all restful api s and our responses are in xml or json but this second is easily see tim where your team will have to take a little bit of for heavy lifting and you know call the apis  get the results back convert them into the application understands and then render the results right again spell check etc we obviously will validate once you implement all the API functions and  auto suggest still exists as the same element that you have to in this is well give you the auto suggest will design it everything will also give you the div tag for that you can also design your own auto suggest not that we recommend that because we will work with you to figure that out anyways but you'll have a lot of control over it as well so that's the two approaches at a very high level and as you can see the hosted approach is what I was suggesting that could really cut down on the effort and puts more and it's not that the effort is gone it's just that it puts more effort on unboxes team rather than Sparkfun.,
