Awesome here's a different way of doing things so we work with a grocery very large grocery brand and what happens here was that they typically had about I want to say 60 to 70 clicks in terms of their interactions with their customers.  They knew exactly what they were gonna buy they bought the same kind of products all the time and so what we did here is if you look at that when they type in chi or this could be chicken right it looks at the top searches for them in terms of what they're buying so you can actually go from cheese to look at the add the amount of quantity and then add it directly to the shopping cart.,
