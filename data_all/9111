So as you can see this header all the way up to say Express is the logo and then where it says sign and card etc you can create a page with the header and the footer with MT in the middle and through the front end we can we can start showing the results of exactly what the search results should be based on our relevancy and that's exactly what we've done with Express here . So starting with the 269 here all the way down to the class result everything gets shown by Unbxd. And we can still control the same requirements like the assortment pricing etc based on that score all you have to do is pass in that store number two us and so how you might have already asked the customer to define a store a liquor store etc through that process and then automatically that catalog and that inventory becomes available to the search system. So we have our from our approach we've worked with a lot of different platforms ATG IBM hyper <> and I'm sure Magento bigcommerce Shopify even systems which have no backend access we've been able to integrate with those also the front end.,
