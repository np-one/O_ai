I mean literally I don't think we've ever paid I mean I think we've site and we've already pretty much after a month to determine that yes we're going to keep them so we've already paid them.  so it's and they didn't charge us anything for the setup they didn't charge anything initially because we again have to be able to prove that this is something that's going to provide values for our sites because we actually work with a very specific revenue return on investment model that we have to stick with.  and we our budget is essentially unlimited as long as the ROI is there we if we do not have any spend constraints for new vendor opportunities the only constraint we have is one proving the case up front.  or two having a smaller proof of concept that we can show our executives and say they won't charge the million bucks for this but hey we got two million bucks back as a result okay sure no problem we have the cash flow but that's not the issue the issue is that they are very strict on our ROI goals because again we report monthly on our ROI goals and this would be rolled into that overall cost so we have to look at that.,
