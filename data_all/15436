But it enhances relevance in two Different ways so relevance will bring in to say okay I'm searching for dress I want to show dress so the relevant system will bring in all the dresses our user behavior system will also bring in the ability to show your popular dress products but sometimes merchants need to override the system because of a business rule so business might be say I have a particular product that is very high in inventory for example now if you expose that product you might at least reduce the inventory it may not be your best selling but you might be putting it on sale you might have reduced the price whatever the case may be . So your merchants team can now boost and organize the product selection in such a way that it exposes different products to the customer so yes it's sort of it's not against the grain of relevancy it's just trying to combine relevancy and business rules. Because everything after that is still based on relevancy as you can see.,
