This is the fastest possible implementation where all you do is just give us a header you give us a footer and you give us an empty div tag and all these that you're seeing is basically a HTML injection from Unbxd right. This is Ajax implementation this is the fastest one the other one that we can do is also a hosted implementation where if you go to say rod start form there is the website right. So here are a few type boots right so the moment I search boots you would see the domain URL change to search dot rods dot com right. This is completely hosted and delivered by Unbxd like if you have too many images and if you want to offload all of that work to Unbxd you can just offload to us and we will serve this from our system itself.,
