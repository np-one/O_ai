yep that's the one so on this particular piece yeah think about it from this perspective Jannie that today you for any spelling mistake or any stemmed words say box in boxes knife vs knives you have to create a synonym on the back end manually create synonym on the back and only after you find out if that's actually a problem what Unbxd have done is 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are automatically falls out of the box and it's not because we have built a list of synonym library on the back end but because we algorithmically figure out whether it customers actually made a spelling mistake you have different algorithms that look in whether letters within transpose dropped completely butchered and we also have we use AI artificial intelligence to figure out that if we suggested a particular correction did the customers actually likely did they interact with it or did they actually go back and we we searched for that for the term differently so that we know that next time you need to do a little bit better in terms of what the question might be.,
