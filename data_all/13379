next is a head query search let's say I was searching for something very high-level which crosses multiple categories in your world it may cross different designs so let's say if I am searching for red shoes which we go into a lot of different designs that you have right and or red Footwear any kind of like that how do we actually maintain and guide the customer through that experience is by showing all the right subcategories so if you were to call it subcategories but also show products at the same time here's another interpretation of that I'll show you really quickly I started for Alexander Wang who's a designer makes a lot of different categories of products so if I search for Alexander Wang I don't know what category the customer may be looking for so how do we actually show these products so totes we show totes up top you're gonna scroll horizontally to see all tote bags then you can horizontally scroll all shoulder bags dresses sandals pumps etc so this way on one singular page a customer can see all different categories of Alexander Wang without having to leave that page and this way we can also guide them in a very neat bucketed manner it gives them the exposure of all the products they may have not thought of discovering also.,
