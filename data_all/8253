and especially in these cases from a UI perspective it would be nice for a user if he can actually horizontally scope the subcategories of this specific keyword do a category scope and vertically start showing all the products and this section can be completely customized. where if after 30 days of machine learning on your site if the system recognizes that say in this case a Bluetooth is more popular than a headphone then a Bluetooth that actually appear before a headphone right. similarly we can do bucketed search results as well typical horizontal and vertical scoping right and another important thing on facets and filters I'll take you through a live example as well you can do this at a query level if you figure that men's casual shoes is a popular query on your site and if you define a specific set of attributes for them. once you set this up then you can basically say men formal shoes men party shoes it does not even have to have the word shoes in it it could be men's Nike men Adidas the results will appear with the same attributes.,
