No no we're not really I mean I you know I like to hear presentations from different parts of the industry know it's good for us for two reasons wanted either confirms that what we're doing make sense or you know you get some of them where it's a wake-up call that hey you're screwing up and you need to to fix it or there's a better there's a better way of doing something I think in this case like you've got a very good approach it makes sense good examples that were that were relevant. So you know I appreciated their context and you know it's an education for both of us so you know stay in touch but I don't see an opportunity you know in the short term.,
