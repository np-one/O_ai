what the help desk system the first thing you know we look at the backend set of things which is for agents or for your internal team collaborations what are the various ways and the channels through which you know you could go about doing this communication so currently I understand that you guys use Outlook there for your email transactions taking place so what you could do is with freshdesk can have a common support email set up you know the email too with either your customers or your vendors right into and that could be a common mailbox that you could use that you could forward these emails coming into the system in the form of tickets so that you have all the email transactions and all the communications on a single platform and all the agents were added you know we're accessing help desk will have complete access and a transparency to you know all the emails that have come in the form of tickets and of course the tracking and the responsibility also increases once it you know when you have it in a single view here so that's it let me do a quick demonstration and show you what a lifecycle of an email based ticket here with freshdesk like right.,
