Now we know that the price inclination is around $65 we know the style the colour that they are more inclined to and we start showing them the products pretty much in the same price range. You would not want to show a 200 dollar product to someone looking at a $65 product and that's why and this is a <> we also have you can go and feed this information into the system and I would want to start recommending plus or minus 5% 10% 20% in price point for this particular widget on a PDP page. But again the idea is to start recommending products which are similar to what there are already looking at and this is all dynamic right you do not have to go and I would say put in or say hard code these things theses are all dynamic content.,
