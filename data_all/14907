sorters as you as you know without a spelling well algorithm knows there there's nothing to to look at so we brought up zero results We looked at stemming right shelving versus shelves we had different results one was in terms of the navigation you could look at shelving but if I did search on shelves it didn't bring any type of relevant results here.  Workbench with a space versus workbench brought in different results as well something that we could take a look at and talk about how we handle stemming Stemming without machine learning here gives you zero a lot of zero results and again what happens with a lot of these zero results increases the abandonment.,
