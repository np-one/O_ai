if I the first product here is Bissell so let's see if I started to search for Bissell this is what the autocomplete experience looks like we split the autocomplete into two segments on the left hand side we show parts and on the right hand side we show models and on the bottom we show top searches so it gives the customers from those parts the exact parts that they are looking for if I don't know what parts I can also search for a model of the appliance but then also there's very popular terms that customers usually search for Bissell.,
