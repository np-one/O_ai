What I'll do is I'll just send you the contract today take a look at that and you can sign off it will only call out the 90 day evaluation period that we discussed and then after that you let us know as to what time next week will work for Alex and you. Or for now I can just tentatively send out an invite for next Monday for half an hour to do a quick kick-off and then after that we can start working with Alex. We will probably just need a read-only access to your Google Analytics and probably some information from Alex so more from a tech side.,
