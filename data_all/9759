so no I absolutely I love a time where I live in Naperville so I the blue Kimia I think in public area days are learn one of the more famous ones very active very great guy and yeah so I I did shopping at a house like some time and my dad loves it even more than I okay so what do you want to also show you Jamie Justin if you don't mind going to be so the first example let's right get it right into because I think Jannie will be very interested in hearing this so Jannie what we've done is we've evaluated the ACE Hardware dot site across five different elements of how we believe a good site search experience should be right and from that perspective what is the experience that we had what did we find what did we not find and some things were good some things we're not so great and we wanted to share those experiences with you and sort of create a dialogue to see where you guys stand I know you said we're actually working on improving it we'd love to hear a little bit more about how you're doing it.so let's get into it let's say the peace obviously searches relevant from an entire end-to-end site search experience search relevance is the biggest challenge right and we were searching for let's say If Unbxd for example and while these are box fan fan box is a completely different item which is what we found when you're navigating while navigating we found these products called fan boxes that actually are the control boxes that go into a ceiling fan right so it's a very it's a very different interpretation just the order of words that come in is quite different with the next example say we were looking for I believe mattress we search for mattress and we got some mattress covers or pillows and but if I search so if I go through navigation or the category pages there's actually mattresses air mattresses etc that are available.,
