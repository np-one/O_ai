yeah okay and for that the main thing they're going to require is two separate sections for example like I stated before we have IT and then we have our site Operations Group so they're going to require a two groups one of them being the trans hosers want to be them being the people who call back so they would require some group to the initial ticket should always be assigned to the transposers because they had to read AFER's make sure everything's good and then assign it and then in all honesty in their contacts list they would just require a contact for like HR and billing and such so what they could do is when they send a ticket and resolve it they can resolve for like subject type of HR and HR automatically receives an email notification being like hey there was a ticket that was just closed underneath but it's been redistributed to you with the URL which we can see if there's a way that you guys can integrate it from their system to auto pull if not copying and pasting the URL will take a second just so they can receive an equal notification.,
