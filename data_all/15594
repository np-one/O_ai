Okay so this is so the the business piece right the auto suggest piece I would say Now let me show you the technology so before the the founders started Unbxd right they spent quite some time good one year and doing research on two things one they crawled through our say I would say web crawled the lot of large e-commerce catalog was available to see how these catalogs were structured today two they did a lot of research in terms of how people are searching online be it on Google search or we be it on Amazon or any other e-commerce site how do people usually search and we classified the search queries into 12 different types right. So say exact query then I know the exact model number exact part number of the search of the product that I am looking for feature search will be say red dress where red is the feature of the product dress. Themattic search could be a party dress where party again is the theme for the product dress linguistic short cut I'm looking for a 55 inch TV and instead of inch I go and put double quotes that becomes a linguistic shortcut query or say natural language query gifts for kids no product specified there but the system needs to be able to understand the intent of the customer and we built a relevancy engine that was able to handle all these 12 different types of queries for any e-commerce site. On top of this what we did was we built an error tolerance system okay so this is a multi-word spell check single word spell check so here not only we automatically correct 85 to 90% of your search queries but we also immediately start showing results not waiting for the customer to click onto something. The other 10 15 percent of the queries that we are not able to solve are actually the ones which are so butchered that it's really difficult for an automated system but you can understand it from from an algorithm strength perspective you have built the system that is able to auto correct us misspelled query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.,
