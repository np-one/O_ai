okay that's perfectly fair and I I wasn't necessarily suggesting that we do a quick deployment just for the sake of deployment to cover the holiday season we were we were looking at from both perspective to say if we were to come up with a way that gives you the ability to quickly deploy is it possible if it is possible if you reduce the effort from your perspective significantly so I'll talk about the two approaches that we typically take to deploy one of them is less work one of them is a little bit more work and then the second piece obviously both from a monthly fees perspective there is definitely my understanding and maybe my realizatdion after the fact was that what we presented as an ROI might be fantastic in all in paper in numbers but what we may be asking for in terms of fees might actually be increasing your budget.,
