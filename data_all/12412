what how do you a quick question there yes I mean one of the issues we've had and I understand that totally but the challenge is we don't have any bright words in that that are typically rising to the extent that sofa would over color so in in the book title there rarely are bright words that make those words rise significantly above the others there are some that are noise words but not a lot of bright word so how do you go about making that kind of differentiation in a case where the words are relatively the same way.,
