you look at these groupings and start showing the right kind of cross-sell and up-sell sections right and we exactly know where do we have to show a cross-sell recommendation widget and where do we have to show an up-sell recommendation widget right the third theme that we built our recommendation widgets on was based on content right. when we talk about content what we did was we look at all the product detailing pages and we see what are the products that can be grouped together right if how can we help a user do alternate product discovery on your site. if for some reason I'm looking at probably buying a specific chandelier right how can I show him similar products and at what journey of the product discovery does showing a similar product widget or an alternate product discovery widget so that I basically capture the users attention in completely right. the fourth theme what we built on was the personalization theme here we basically look at it's a cookie based approach if somebody logs in through an incognito window you won't know much information but if he does not then what we know is basically where the user is coming in from what's the seasonality to that location that the user is coming in from.,
