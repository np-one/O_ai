There is Parts warehouse. Yeah okay great so uh parts warehouse one of our early customers and they've been using us for a couple of years now so the business problem that they had was that they had two kinds of customers coming on there site and let me give you about the other time what what Parts Warehouse does today is that they sell vacuum vacuum cleaner parts so the kind of visitors they have on their website are two kinds. One people who know what part number they are looking for facility there so two kind of customers one who knows exactly what part number they are looking for two people who know the model of the vacuum part that they need to buy the vacuum the model of the vacuum cleaner that they need to buy the parts for and before they came to Unbxd this is how their website look like right they had searched by part search by model two search boxes the problem with this this whole approach was that now the onus was completely on to the customer to decide what search bar to use what if they pick the wrong search box you now have to optimize and and you have to optimize two search boxes in two different ways.,
