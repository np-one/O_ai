got it so it's very simple to integrate recommendations and I'll show you the business model is two sets of fees one is a setup fee if let's say you do all the work for setting it out there is no setup fee if you want us to do some of the work the setup fee ranges from say $500 to $700 one-time now from a the second key is the monthly fee because this is a SAS product what we do is you give us a product feed right you can either give us a fee that you have your standard format or you can stand it as if to our format either way you upload the feed you do the analytics that's the second thing we need and then you basically can create all these widgets as div tags because these are all front end based integrations so let's say innovation you can basically give us a div tag right so let's say here if I go back to the home page you create a empty div tag right just like this an empty div tag and you put our JavaScript code on the page and I'll JavaScript will populate the right sets of products to show up and what the look and feel is can be customised to your site okay should we say hand pick just for you or should we say recommend it for you should we say we recommend this or you know how does the site museum rep use mint recommendations etc you can customise it to whatever you want it to look like and the products what you show you the product image title price whatever else that you want to show and easily easily easily shown on the product page okay.,
