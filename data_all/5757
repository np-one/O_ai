that's one number two is it's not just implementation it's also designing certain elements because we've done so many implementations we can give our thoughts the design team can ultimately figure out how to design it but they cannot come up with a thing that looks like Pluto and our recommendation is Mars right give you an idea so just so that those elements are aligned they can't come back and say oh we want to show something something really awesome but it's not practically possible to do something like that and the business may not necessarily from a customer experience perspective it may not really stop being cool and being there not functional right so it becomes very cool but not functional for the customer which you know you can see this particular searching experience could sort of talk about that it's trying to keep your experience that you already had on the left and give you a separate search experience but it's not working as you can tell so we want to make sure that we don't come up run into something like that.,
