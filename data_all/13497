so here's parts warehouse there are a texas-based company almost 35 million dollars in annual revenue and what they sell is parts for appliances right now the issue was they have two types of customers one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have so they used to have 2 search boxes to accommodate both types of users we obviously came in and said no you can't do that one because you're putting the orders of the customer 2 what if they take the wrong search box and three you can only optimise one search box at a time so here's what we built for their solution if I start to type in Dyson you can see that the left hand side shows parts right hand side shows models and you also have some keyword suggestions.,
