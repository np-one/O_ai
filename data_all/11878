this is what magento offers right so let me just show you the different layouts we have within our auto suggest now there are a lot of them a lot of other designs besides the ones I show you here I'm gonna send them over to you in an email to you so that you can go through them and then take a call on the kind of order suggest you want but I just want to give you an idea of the different elements we have within this order suggest the first thing here is something we call the guided search what essentially this does is it categorizes your data based on your data this could be brands this could be categories or subcategories and so on so for example if someone starts typing in t-shirts Asian my catalog I may actually want to show the different brands that this product was available in OR the different categories that this product is available so these are all configurable and as soon as you click on any of them it directly takes you to the page with that particular attribute filtered on already so it just helps in categorizing the data faster and helps in users reaching the right set of data a lot faster than first going to a search page and then the filter and so on so this takes care of that we also have the popular product section now this is something which is popular in real time it takes into account the clicks the active part and the order is happening on your site and based on the query that is being typed in it shows you the most popular products they want.,
