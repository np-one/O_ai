look that's a good question so one of the best ways to measure that is to do an a/b test so if you don't have an a/b testing tool we can figure something out in terms of how we can split the traffic also but a/b test is the best way to actually test it and if you don't have an a/b test instant before and after tests where we use comparable timelines and comparable percentages to make sure that let's say let's say June we've deployed this in May and June and July are equal months for you guys relatively speaking and in June let's say we're doing the integration and June you did 1.5 percent conversion rate in July if it is a comparable month you typically would have done 1.5 also but with Unbxd we're able to now a 1.75 conversion.,
