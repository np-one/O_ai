and the way we've done is is primarily based on the Intel machine learning logic we've done two things one is we've made the machine learning system contextually aware into the retails space itself and we've also gone a step further of sensitising the machine learning algorithm for every vertical so this has been a machine learning algorithm has been trained across five million words commonly used in the e-commerce context and then there is vertical specifically learning that the machine learning platform itself and now the platform's over six years mature so it improves every single day.,
