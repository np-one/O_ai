okay all right users also complain that they wanted to filter by price but were unable to do so so it seems like obviously there is no filters and I think this is something I remember from last time when we talked about that if you get a lot of results filters do two things for you obviously they give you the ability to filter the results down but they also give you the ability to see what you have in the results set in a very quick glance so if I now see price as a filter for example I can actually see what the ranges of products I have in what price range is ranging from $10 to $500 or is it from 10 to 15 .,
