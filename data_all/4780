Okay awesome US Patriot tactical they are a thirty five million dollar company based out of Texas they sell the military apparel to citizens for them brands and some of the categories of these brands is very important right and here is what we have built for them the moment I start typing Ni it starts showing me Nike as the most popular brand some of the categories within Nike so the other brands that I would have probably not looked at Nite ize Night vision Nine line apparel and their popular brands sorry categories some of the top queries starting with Ni on right hand side it starts showing you some of the popular products and last week when I was doing this demo the black boot here was actually on the fourth position so that's how dynamic it is right there's it incorporates machine learning and popularity based on what people are viewing clicking for a particular search query those products automatically start posting up here is another example from Express as a brand for them categories was very important and this is what we did for them the moment I start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories and when I browse through these each category starts showing some other popular products for each individual category let me show you Ashley Furniture Home Store they wanted a simple window as far as I remember right they have some popular products here now the sofas some of the popular sofa queries that they have here right and the last one that I wanted to show was big basket dot com they are the second largest grocery retailer in <> I know this is not from your vertical but I wanted to show the breadth of customization of this particular piece which is autosuggest right big basket dot com 2 challenges that we solved for them a they had visitors who used to be the visitors used to buying similar products in each grocery run and they used to buy 15 to 20 products in each transaction which used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to search the product go to the product page Add to Cart and then check out and to solve that we built something like that this the moment I start typing in chicken start showing all the options for chicken the prices quantity allows me to increase quantity and Add to Cart right here from search box on right hand side it starts showing me some of the commonly searched terms for chicken popular brands popular categories allows you to put a banner to promote any particular product for a particular cat search query not just that also act with personalization to it because they have repeat customers so if I was buying Anytime chicken boneless more often then I would see this on top but if you were buying masala chicken more often on the side and you would start seeing masala chicken on top so all these examples you see there from different verticals and every customer had a different challenge right so once we onboard a customer we understand the user behavior how people are buying on your site how do they search for products on your site and then we come up with some of these customed designs which would be most appropriate for your site right and we obviously take your feedback as well because you would know your business best but the idea is that something that works for Ashley might not work for you something that works for you might not work for Express right so for each site the experience has to be different because the buying behavior of the customers on each site is different.,
