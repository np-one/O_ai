Okay so with regards to search reporting right one of the challenge that Google Analytics and all these traditional tools have is that once say I come onto your search and I come to your site right and I start my search session with search I searched for something I don't find it I do navigation and I end up buying a product. Just because my session on your site started with search Google will still tell you that it was a search conversion and not a navigation conversion right it's a very traditional problem with search reporting through some of these solutions that we come in and then solve from a technology perspective we can clearly define what what's what what a browse traffic is versus what your search traffic is we give you three levels of reporting.,
