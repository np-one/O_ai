Monal I think you <>  have pointed out here b2b customers would also like it a lot because lot of b2b customers know the products so this screen is designed for people who don't want to go to product detail page and just want to reorder same thing and b2b business people would like to order from that page itself and move on. Well our b2b site have some technology like that built into it has what we call a quick order so they can just type in the product number and it pops up good method <another> product number. We we also have the ability to <>. Ashish for Monal's benefit go to place an order from the search box itself of big basket yeah and then add to the cart right there.,
