You will see a no results search page and what unboxes done is we have approached this completely from a different perspective we have built three algorithms it combines three distinct algorithms. Like learning algorithm that looks as transposing of letters another algorithm that looks at dropping off of letters and a third one that actually looks at neural networks to remember how the suggestions worked out and how how did it play out. We have solved we have tried to solve I won't say we have solved you have tried to solve the spelling check into automatically without having a synonym library so what we do is let's say I search for black leather jacket. First of all will auto correct all three of them without you having to create any kind of library or a dictionary on the back end we it's not like we've created this ginormous permutation combination structure and we automatically just solve that we have actually solved it through an algorithm. And we do three things will auto correct it to say black leather jacket will show all the different options let's say a black leather jacket had two options or three options of alternatives will show option 1 comma 2 comma 3. And the third thing we'll do is if let's say customers the most common one is option 1 we start showing results for option 1 automatically we don't wait for the customer to choose one but if customers over time start to choose option 2 a lot more will automatically switch option 2 to option 1 and start with showing results for that.,
