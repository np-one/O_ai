okay got it so in the search a piece what Louk said you know the header and the footer so everything from search results to sorting through pagination filters on the left side any kind of product blocks everything all of that component can be controlled by Unbxd. it still looks and feels exactly like what it is today for you but it can be controlled by unbox through the front end method if you do it from the back end give you the elements to render that content but you have total control of whether you want to show it or not to it and how you want to show it.,
