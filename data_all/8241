one was they had a fairy large catalog and the problem was people easily come and find a brand like Nike and buy it buy a shoe from Nike but they also have some of these niche products which build and make and manufacture these military uniforms which are not very well known. so they wanted the autocomplete to be more guided to also show products which are sure products and brands which are not well-known but once the user starts using them he or she will start loving it plus they had a lot of very expensive products and they wanted a fairly good visual view of all that popular products with images. so the way we built the autocomplete for them is the moment you start typing n i where I probably intend to type in Nike a it will show me the brand Nike and it will show me that these three are the three most popular category of boots in Nike. it will also tell me that there's something called as nite glow gear and nine line apparel which probably I would have never known if had not looked at this autocomplete so that it gives me a visual into the long tail of the site it also tells me what are my top search queries for something starting with n i and you would also see all the popular products.,
