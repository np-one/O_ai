So say we would have noticed five out of ten people buying humidifiers are also also mine cart widgets so he immediately starts showing cart widgets five out of ten people who buy nail color are also buying lip colors so we immediately start showing lip color to kind of cross sell someone who's buying a nail color. Similar products within the cart someone's not checked out they're still in the cart not sure if they want to to check out you can put a widget and start showing some of the similar products for them to be sure and to evaluate and complete the purchase if something I showed you as part of our search presentation these are two recommendation widgets actually recently viewed and and recommendations which we put as part of our search solutions as  well. Same thing for similar products this is again a part of search solution as well as a recommendation solution because start showing some of the similar products to the customers same thing on mobile this is the PDP page recommendations someone on a mobile product page you can start showing them. Some of the alternative products on a smaller mobile screen as well. And then finally the by the look so say merchants can come and define that in that that shorts right if someone is looking for short start recommending them t-shirts jackets shoes and then we can provider by the look button so the customer has the ability to click on buy the look but and merchants define what kind of products to be shown here and this way the customer now can complete the look now knows that with this shorts this jacket this shoes or this t-shirt might go well and they can select what to buy and complete the look. So that's the very high level of produc tommendation solution any questions.,
