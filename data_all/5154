right so what happens in this case is let's say the column that is called metal type or metal or whatever material let's say it's called anything anything like that basically what then happens is you change this to call it whatever your column is and it's a material or metal type or just metal and then you pass in the value whatever that value so if essentially acts as a database for you and based on some of the parameters which medicine will respond with the results so for example you can also come in and say I want category ID equals 25 and metal type equals scope then we will give you exactly those results that match those two categories those values.,
