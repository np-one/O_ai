US Patriot tactical you also work with US auto parts Frederick out of New York we have started to work with a lot of special cargo based companies as well we were just in conversation yesterday with Sears and Sears and Granger and Granger another division called aura tools so we were starting to work with them as well and on the on the flipside from a technology perspective you know a lot of the elements that we had talked about two years ago we've added a lot more and a tremendous amount of capabilities around it so here's the five aspects as to how we were evaluating and evaluating the ABT experience one from a search relevance perspective and I know you said then there's you know all these improvements and I totally agree we wanted to give you a little bit of sense to say where some of the more common improvements can be and what how would we approach it and even if you don't work with us you and these will have some idea next is how does the whole auto suggest which is the first interaction and customer has with the site search what does that look like then we have synonyms the spinning and error correction stuff spelling mistakes and then you had a mobile optimisation and usability will show you that as well. ignoring the scorecard right now this is just a piece to pitch together certain elements to give you a sense I would be score it based on the experience that we've had now this is something that has been tremendously unique to us can that we've developed over the past two years there's a quilt 12 query types so what we noticed working with 1200 websites is that every single customer when they search that query can be divided into one of three high-level segments whether it's a query spectrum a qualifier or a structure and we have written an algorithm to individually solve each one of these so what I mean by spectrum is let's say I'm looking for an exact product so I'm looking for a refrigerator a very specific refrigerator what I'm looking for a product type and the product type could be I'm looking for iPhones right what is a qualifier would be I'm looking for it's featured a feature of a particular product so I'm looking for a likes a black iPhone or a linguistic shortcut would be I'm looking for an 18 inch or 18 cubic feet and how many different ways I might write cubic feet right do I spell it out do i do cu-ft etc and has become one of our extremely important differentiators and strengths that we make to the table.,
