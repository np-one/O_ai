so typically about you know the email of a life cycle of an email based ticket that's into the ticket speed but coming back to this page here was also possible as when you have multiple use in the system what they could do is they can come here and set up views for themselves so at you can have your own set of custom filters too so I can say that you know my default view I would like to have it as all the tickets that have been assigned to me after along the status let's say which are either open or pending so exactly what I could do is come here save this view and let's say I'd say them as these are welcome tickets so that I know that you know this becomes my default view in the system so when you have multiple such agents they can have their own sets of you so that they need not have to every time come and fill in these filters to filter out the tickets that they are responsible for they can have their own set of views too.,
