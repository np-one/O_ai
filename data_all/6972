similarly you can do it for a specific category as well you can go create a custom landing page for a category and you can also reorder facets for every category say for say in this case Nikkers probably price could be the most important filter then it could be say size then it could be say colour you can reorder them and save changes and then after the few days based on the click stream data if say colour is a more click filter than price and colour automatically moves up on top.,
