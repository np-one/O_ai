based on the feed that we are getting in from you at this point of time I think the data that bit just getting in is the category which is not available for all the products we are getting the product type information for each of these products and apart from that we're getting in a lot of time now I'm sure this must be a lot of manual mapping done for each of these specific products but at this point of time if you look at this data then even when we are providing you a fast navigation something like her or probably US Patriot it has at this point of time there are a lot of different elements if you would have to work on well there can be a way in which unlocks can stop being of data from the tags that you have just to come up with products now it would just be based on the fact that you want to show gold pins and silver pins and bronze pins or it could just be the occasion for which a specific pin would be used so depending on this data and if you have a standard set of values let's say you have come up with 10 to be values at your data needs to be segregated into then unlocks can definitely go back and we can write some scripts and make sure that we've actually segregated in and segmented your data in that specific way now while still an <> on our end or within the product catalog and unboxed n what we've seen is in Shopify we can then go back and upload the same data for the products that you have or by using some of the Shopify API so I can you know send them the details for that in an email to you but let's say I go ahead and populate 5 or 6 custom fields here all that we have to do is then use the Shopify API at your end and then make sure that we've updated this information within the shopify catalogue itself so that's something.,
