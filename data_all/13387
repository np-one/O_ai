oh no no we are she bad a little man I should Bradshaw not okay so the next thing is variances let's say a particular shoe was available in different colors and a customer was searching for that particular color we would automatically show the right image of that shoe it's a variance problem that we also solve we also have a color synonym corpus so if somebody was looking for a coffee colored shoe right but you don't have any coffee colored shoes but your brown color shoes you know the coffee and brown and close proximity to a chain will automatically show that also okay as your results page if a customer for whatever reason gets the zero results page because they totally garbage then the recommendations will also came to give them the ability to go back by showing a recent review or to go forward by showing some recommendations based on that users behavior in real time okay quick way to quickly evaluate alternatives if I were to I don't know why I like these shoes or there were too many reasons why I like to choose the style color the price if I wanted to quickly evaluate alternatives I can click on the see similar products link open up in a modal window see alternatives like them click them if I don't like them you can close and you go back to the search experience here's how we do it in mobile it's adaptive and responsive based on that and again on mobile you want to show a lot of variety because it's less space so if customer wants to see similarity this is the best way to expose them to that here's where our auto suggest would look like in mobile scope suggestions popular queries and recent searches depending on what type of catalogue you have we may also have thumbnails and subcategories or categories and search queries based on that okay here's a category of Fineman UI so if i search for a very high-level query and I know that it crosses multiple categories subcategories show them i was also showing some filter options and some relevant products always showing products if I click on the subcategory and I if there are some subcategories we will show them as well continue to guide keep guiding the customer right and then filter and sort by options and also obvious your products we also have multi select filters that look like this out of the box with a reply button to optimise for a mobile experience any questions so far.,
