Okay so the first thing that I looked at on your site was Auto suggest right and why Autosuggest because this is the first interaction that the customer is making on the site it's very important that we start guiding them to the right set of products that expose the right set of products that they would be more like able to buy and this can be done in various ways we start exposing the most-searched queries we start exposing the most popular products some of the most popular brands or categories given what's important on in a particular product catalog or on an e-commerce site. What I see here is a very traditional cookiecutter solution you have for search queries you have four products right and if I'm not wrong these products that are also coming up are random right I'm sure you're someone looking for ID right and I could have completed that as ID car ID printers or say ID card software's but these products might not be your most popular products right. Respective of what the customer would have you know completed this as a query starting with ID similarly with say ID ID badge molar or ID badge or ID card slot punch might not be the most popular search terms at times right. Same thing with the printer it's a printer print as a customer I'm not sure if this would actually clicking on any of these would actually make or add value to my search on this site right and  let me not bore you with these rights let me show you actually a few examples that will give you an understanding in terms of how this can be approved I'm just moving my screen so give me like ten seconds and I'll show you some of the examples here from various different vertices. Do you see parts warehouse screen.,
