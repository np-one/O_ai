all right well it seems like the vendor is not necessarily doing this particular  job it's being because we tested the site search functionality to a lot of different lenses so adopt a lot of different types of queries and 12 to be exact because what Unboxd has classified is about 12 different types of query and we found 10 that did not work so almost 90% the queries aren't working and you're definitely paying a vendor that's not giving a result so what are those types of queries clearly playing snow boots not giving the results we showed you that GPS units also the same thing this is something I did by the way okay this is not what the participants did this is I spent some time to try to figure out what can be shown and what can you what can we show from a performance perspective this PDF creation tool actually overruled okay ladies waterproof gloves and Honda bike cover so this is what ladies waterproof gloves is showing Honda bike covers is showing this next is head protection you can see very clearly that it's  not giving you the right results bike gears subjective search like cool sunglasses zero results for non products if I was searching for a return policy for example or exchange policy it still continues to look at the product catalogue rather than giving you the FAQ it has to be intuitive enough to be able to do that as well natural language searches if I was searching for jackets under $50 it does not understand the natural language processor into the keyword in women's category when searching for jacket it shows men's jackets so this is an implicit search if you think about it if you let's say go to target for example and in target store physical store if I was in a women's section and I asked the salesperson with our pants or jacket there's no implicitly that there are you looking for women's jackets and that is the same sort of an experience that a customer could have on the site where they are looking at a particular category a very high-level category they implicitly ignore to tell you that they're looking for that category subcategory products like jackets in this example so you need to understand from a individual customer perspective the personalization aspect in the search experience also and that's is some key takeaways things with something does work there's a yes if it doesn't work it's a no and basically grouped by each and individual stage the discovery selection comparison return check out and return and that's it Lauren I don't know if this is what you were expecting or not but that's what we had worked on.,
