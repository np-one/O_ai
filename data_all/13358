so we can experiment with exposing them to a cross sell for kids that could create a specific section that says kids shoes you know you may also like some kids shoes for the family or something like that where the title sort of gives them an idea to say oh it's not they were saying this is for you but if you're looking at an adult shoe page you can also suggest and say maybe for the family and you can show kids shoes and we can experiment with that too by implementing something like that and then see if people are people are clicking on that people are exposing that you're getting this cross channel exposure then is it actually behaving in terms of and resulting injecting conversions that we've had we have something to work with if it totally bombs we obviously will help you and remove that but I think the best way to know if you don't know the best way to know would be to actually expose there with something and our designer can come up with some ideas based on what we think might be really applicable to do that kind of cross sell .,
