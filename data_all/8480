So here is is an example for I would say Express if I was to look for tops for jeans it shows me the tops and not jeans right it's able to understand that that someone is looking for tops and not jeans as a product same thing for say theme based queries like someone looking for a winter jacket right someone coming and looking  for expensive suits for men alright. Now the system is able to understand expensive means higher in price more luxury element comes into picture so that's the kind of training that we give to the algorithms for all our customer sites to be able to understand search terms understand natural language queries and then show the right set of results.,
