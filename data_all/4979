and the last piece is the analytics so today you mentioned that you know maybe you don't listen to track conversion for a search query what we do is we actually give you data on the exact experience that the customer had for that search we do a one-to-one correlation for example I'll give you an example let's say I searched for like the screw drivers in this example I can get good results then I went to the category I navigated to different pages and I found like with screwdrivers and <> what your analytics might tell you is that that search session at a conversion which is true I searched in that session and I bought in that session but it's misleading because I did not buy directly from search so Unbxd actually there's a one-to-one correlation and figures out whether the customer bought directly from search or not and so now you're able to identify queries that are not performing as well and you can now optimise rather than pick the problem so I know I'm taking a lot of your time and I'm babbling also all this Jannie I wanted to see is this something that you find interesting is this something that you guys your team members would love your colleagues and bosses would welcome to play if you need a system like this we did a system like this that solves a lot of problems but also gives us the opportunity and the console's will optimise for business.,
