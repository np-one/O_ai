Yeah no I totally get it I totally understand that and last was the the mobile piece again I think coming from a mobile experience perspective that whole big basket example that I showed you the grocery example I believe would be a much richer and much more faster experience because and you might see and maybe this is a behavior test and you might already know this a lot of customers coming in are mobile especially from B2B we usually know exactly what they're looking for you're not doing a lot of discovery on mobile phones. Because you know one day you're not gonna go through navigation because it takes six or seven clicks to do navigations so search is primary on mobile but in when they search they typically have they can't type in six words right they'll maybe to one word and maybe two words at the most and typically they'll like to know exactly what they were buying they might get into the item IDs and stuff like that. So that whole grocery type experience could be very very important in terms of helping them get to that product and get in and get out very quickly. And that's it that's that's the that's the solution Chris.,
