so yeah so I get that I get the context of one of the key things that you mentioned was also the data issue right so one of the things we have tried solving for data because a lot of retailers we also work with have actually a huge number of SKUs and they also have SKUs that change differently especially in the auto space we work with this customer call us auto a specific product could be named differently two years ago but today it is named something else but a customer who's bought something on their site some time back might probably remember that specific way to look for that product and he or she might search for it in that context and today the data might have changed so that's why what we generally also do is when we drive relevancy we just don't look at the title of the product itself we look at the title we look at the entire PDP description and we also look at reviews so that we are a lot more comprehensive in showing up relevancy it didn't also a lot of jobs that we'll have to do at our end that's why we have built this Hadoop system which can actually accentuate all this data in real time but we believe by doing that our relevancy is much more stronger overall .,
