To keep in mind one more thing I'm just gonna tell you just to help you with your sales process today today Walgreens is running on elastic and then we just migrated away from Endeca and so right now with the product management teams you know there's there's somewhat of a focus more on trying to get the fundamentals working correctly in elastic okay rather than looking at you know additional partners for you know improvement so that you know I think to get there and in the in the next couple of months where we'll get all the fundamentals cleaned up and then I'll start to be more open to looking at partners but today that's kind of where they're at is they are they are busy you know they're all completely focused and busy on trying to trying to solve for all the problems from the implementation so they're not real open right now to ideas about new products and services.,
