perfect so that's the second piece that I wanted to then bring up is nothing to do with search how can you leverage a easy-to-use back and dashboard I'm tell the reason I'm making a leap of assumption here but because I'm assuming that because the category pages may be driven by solar the merchandising team may not have a dashboard or a capability to actually create that override and if they wanted to create an override they have to go to IT because solar is purely an AI T function and it does not contain any kind of merchandising dashboard per se to be able to do those types of functions now it's not just saying so a business rule maybe I want to reorder some of the products or another business rule might be I have new sets of products are coming up right you have this new product there's a certain limitation to how you can expose new products through email marketing or other marketing channels and this is where merchants may come in and say you know what I want these specific set of products to show up and it needs to have the capability to auto decay so I want this new shirt to have the exposure for one week for five days while it's out there or two weeks whatever the case may be and then you want those rules to automatically decay versus in solar there is no such capability and this is again me I'm reaching for these examples the second opportunity here is what I or this is me coming from outside in if I'm buying shirts versus say I'm buying and I'll open this in the new Sam buying shirts or I'm buying shorts the filters on the left-hand side you can see today are pretty much the same it's consistent in the order of how the filters show up so I have category brand color price range size etc and same thing with here I will have category brand color size pricing etc the the reason to bring this up is for cat even for category pages or for search pages when a customer is navigating through shirts or shorts or shoes different filters become very important more important than other filters so you actually might want to show four shorts you might want to show size first maybe because you see that when customer is on the category page they use that filter more than any other filter for this category for shoes it might be something else for t-shirts it might be something else for for jackets it might be something else and you have tons of attribution for different sets of products so which filters become more important for which category you can also define that to an easy-to-use dashboard I can show you that also the third thing from a navigation perspective again I and I understand this most popularity score is used we actually take that experience to a personal level so beyond the just merchandising and better experience aspect we personalise the navigation results to a one on one level what I mean by that is let's say for example I wanted to I went to Judy Schwartz and I either used a filter or brown or some colour filter or I used a particular pricing element then or I search for something and I spend time on a particular set of products we build a persona for that customer and when they come back to that same category page we actually will show different sets of results based on what their customer has done in that session because we believe let's say for example I am looking for you know khaki color looking shorts and if the first row two rows of results is all black and blue will actually show a little bit more packing results we'll mix it in to show more khaki results because we scene and this again is all dependent on business elements that why customers buy from you say for example color they cannot buy this color anywhere else ok I'm just showing this example out I do not know what your differentiators are or uniqueness is but whatever those are we are able to weigh them in order of importance and using that data you can reorder the results when they see the same category so you will see different sets of results I will say different sets of results which should still be over right using the merchandising rules but it does give you the ability to do that and the same experience is also translated into search so the one on one behavior aspect is also translated into search and the collective behaviour of all the different customers is also then implied in to search for it let's say a brand new user and we do that per query and search ok the last thing I wanted to show you is personalised product recommendations so personalised product recommendations today let's say if I'm looking at this khaki I was made this is khaki colour they're shorts or beige and what are the recommendations you may also like that you show here today by the way are these homegrown also or do you guys use a vendor for that.,
