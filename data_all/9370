One is the semantic relevance and I'll go into detail for each one of them second is the exclusions third is user behavior and boosting and which is what we call is merchandising. So let's say we get into the the semantic relevance piece let's say I'll take a simple example women's white jeans. Or if you take the example that we found on kirklands where we saw pink kids pillow right so what is happening with pink kids pillow is you have three options typically. If either it will do pink or kids or pillow to search into the system into the catalogue or it will do pink and kid and pillows. Sometimes you'll also have a technique called minimum match called so it will say pink pillows or pink kids or kids pillows etc. And but in even in that instance the challenge is exactly what you see I believe that today a kirklands is probably configuring it to do an and so it must find all the key words in the beginning and then does an or to get more subsequent products.,
