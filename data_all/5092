let's say any wouldn't be with me I couldn't find any diversity first of all you have but let's say there are products that you don't carry and that's where you're looking for that this is some outdated option that some search spring or some other players provide we believe in today's day and age when a customer has interruption in their journey because of your result we need to give them two options one to go back which is we tell review and second should go forward which is recommendation based on their behavior in real time in that session okay now let's say a customer is looking at a particular set of shoes they don't know why they like this shoes or there might be too many reasons why their life issue either way they cannot tell you finalisation true so how can we give them a quick way to evaluate alternative when you click on the link called see similar products under each product it opens up in a modal window and you can see alternatives very quickly without interrupting their search express here's on mobile so in mobile jonah you probably have noticed that you want to show customers and variety of products because you have less space you want to quickly give them an idea of all the variety of products that you have but if a customer becomes interested in similarity you can then now get more like these button opens up in a modal window you like it click on it if you don't close it if you go back to your experience without interrupting here's what we do on mobile with autocomplete we have worked with economies like Japan in Asia APAC <<where many and perhaps this will be tweeting photo just popular and we teach you the four because those experiences>> get interrupted a lot so to get a customer back to exactly where they left off recent searches became the most useful tool next is let's say I search for a very high-level query and you we know that shoes are in man woman boy girl and you okay that might just be this minute work and how do we continuously guide the customer to an enchant this is a UI interpretation of we show the categories we also provide filters and sorting options but we also always show product regardless of what happens you always show product if you click on a category in or subcategory we start showing subcategories I've been also operational Travis balsa here's where our filters look like out of the box those multi select any questions so far.,
