I I'm not sure maybe maybe maybe the way we can do it is because of the Associated sales aspect of it maybe we can come up with some sort of a hybrid that if we are directly relating and correlating increase in sales we can definitely I can definitely try to push hard to get the product side of things managed at this rate the content is definitely going to be something I have to really double check so let me I will take that as a next step for myself to see what we can do what content and maybe we can come up with a hybrid where you still use your current provider and hundred dollars which is a phenomenal price by the way whoever is your negotiator I want to hire that guy then then we can come up with to say you can continue to use them for content and use us for product because ultimately selling more product is where you are going to see the ROI piece I don't know if that's good is gonna be.,
