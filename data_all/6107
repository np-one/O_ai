so let's say women's dresses is a category I can go into dresses click on the facets on the left and now what you'll see is the standard order or the default order of facets as determined by the algorithm so the algorithm will come in and say okay price is first and colour title etc now you may come in and say you know what that's not how I want I want colour to be first I want say gender to be second this is just sample filter so please go buy it but I just want to show you how easy it is on occasion to be third and that's it hit save and no matter how I search for dresses this order of filters if I search for black dress red dress evening dress a black evening dress party wear party dress doesn't matter the filters will always come to this order.,
