I'll show you one last example again this is a very different vertical but grocery what we did here was we wanted to show in grocery world you want to buy a lot of different products very quickly typically online grocery sells 35 to 40 products in a single transaction for this customer is used to take about 100 to 120 clicks to buy 35 to 40 products by creating a UI like this where I can start showing results and Add to Cart right from the autocomplete because most of the products are repeat product repeat behaviors I was able to narrow down for 120 clicks to about 40 to 45 click by 35 to 40 product any questions so far.,
