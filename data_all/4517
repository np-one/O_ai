got it perfect so there's two parts to it from that perspective Paul I know that the platform you've chosen is Hybris and I'm sure part of the evaluation you know that Hybris on the back engine has solar to drive its product discovery which could include site search your category pages for product recommendations specifically obviously solar doesn't do anything from that perspective but the there are specific challenges with solar as well. in terms of personalization within search and category pages so I what I want to do is I want to give you a sort of a high-level overview in terms of what we do and how we interact in terms of the capabilities of personalization but also solve some of the challenges that Solar within Hybris doesn't know how to solve.,
