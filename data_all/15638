Typically not right we do not touch our UI or UX except a few of the things like auto suggest or placing those recommendation widgets where you want to put some of these things that's it right apart from that we don't touch your UI we only render results we show the relevant products keeping the UI same whatever UI you have so typically not but what what we can do is who this is this is a much more broader question if this is something that you want to immediately do what we can do is we can do a three-way called we knew your agency and my team my tech team to understand the scope of work in terms of what each of them is doing and time it accordingly. Because in some cases we have seen that if parallely done implementation with redesigning of the sites in some cases we have not right and that's a call I leave with the tech team to take to make sure that that the complete implementation goes smoothly and does not create any conflicts right . And at the same time at times it helps to do both together so that you are not doing and undoing stuff you might have ended up paying your agency for doing something that we could have probably handled at our end.,
