well all right so if it's Gmail it's a very simple set up in fact you have your settings here and under the settings there of this forward or pio PRI map option coming here so this way I'm gonna add the forwarding address and it's a two-way verification that happens and once that is done you know all the tickets all the emails that come into your physical mailbox would be converted into tickets automatically.,
