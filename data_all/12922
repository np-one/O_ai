really pleased with the formatting of of my current recommendations so they just it makes the image a little smaller and it doesn't quite I don't feel like it's as quite as attractive as it potentially could be see all that wasted space below where you have a price and you have the button and the picture of the product is smaller I almost want the inverse where the picture is bigger the text is smaller or even you know I don't know if if price is maybe something we skip I don't know.,
