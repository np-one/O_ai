So here is an example of say crystal vaults site with them and they came came to us for them the most important thing was to make their content searchable if I'm not wrong they have over 50000 articles and that's the main source of traffic on their site where people come to read a lot about various different crystals right. And they always wanted the content to be searchable but then the business still runs on on selling products right and hence they would still want to push products first still giving customer the ability to read content. So here if I say type amethyst right on the left hand side you see all the products here these are all the products right but here you see there are some content pages right amethyst meaning and uses if I click on this this actually takes me to a page that shows me content right these other guided the resources these are not products these are all content pages for amethyst and then again we start showing products right.,
