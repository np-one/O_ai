Got it okay so the one thing we wanted to share on the stemming piece is that Unbxd solves stemming out of the box so if you Have a web camera or webcam if you have a center or central game gaming cable cabling all of those stemmed words automatically solved out of the box because we use a and we also use in NLP but we've also built NLP into our system that on in real time it is able to actually solve that stemming problem without having to rely on synonyms we also have built a synonym library but I'm sure that your synonym library is probably much richer from an industrial jargon perspective because you would have more direct context to them than we would but as far as stemming is concerned absolutely a solved problem. And stemming could be look from a linguistic shortcut perspective or stemming could be from a just an English word perspective say charger versus discharging versus volts versus volt all of those who do not have to create any kind of synonyms on the background to solve that. The other piece was the error correction that is also something that we've built as an algorithm and not actually a synonym library where we are able to solve 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes out of the box without having any kind of synonym library on the back end.,
