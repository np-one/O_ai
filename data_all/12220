so this could be one way of doing the implementation and as I said most of the work will be done the Unbxd but obviously will meet your team's help in making sure that you know the right divs are replaced and the whole pricing pieces taken care of by you know taking the right Java scripts and their end so this is obviously the third way is you know going ahead with a back-end implementation where your team goes ahead and calls our api's directly for the search the auto suggest the filters and the sorts and we provide complete consultation to your team while they do this implementation.,
