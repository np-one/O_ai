Great so I'll quickly run you through this and then feel free to stop me on any of the slides so the first thing that we actually look on an look on any site is the autocomplete or the autosuggest and and the reason being this is the first interaction of visitors on your site makes with you in terms of looking for the right products right one thing that you are doing good on on the site is surely the the visual i've come across a lot of sites would do not have visuals on autosuggest. So you have that taken care of but with regards to the results if we notice that there are just four results for any queries that that we type in and and most of the times these results are probably not even relevant so I was looking for boots here and you would see all results were t-shirts. Then next I tried shoes got the same for t-shirts and then I tried to look for something from Adidas good you are showing me to Adidas products not sure if they are really very popular products on your website but those are the only two that came up the others were from Puma and UHS sport. Then what what we looked at was the error tolerance or the spellcheck on the website you and I both would agree that today the visitors intend to make mistakes right.,
