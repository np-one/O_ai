absolutely and the idea behind here this is a feature query Ken yeah yeah here is iPhone is the product and black is the colour attribute right or finish attribute you might have a material attribute very different about it I might use a double-door Refrigerator I still got to show you what refrigerators even though there might be cabinets that have double doors on them so it's not just a text pattern match which is what typicals out there who do I think is find the word black and the word iPhone and start showing you that I have to be able to understand that I'm looking for an iPhone and to show you that first and so that's the relevancy piece then you have the user behavior component the user behavior component is important because let's say you're you know iPhone blacks but iPhone 6s are more popular than say iPhone 6s plus and they might be the more current version of the iPhone may be iPhone 7 is coming out new newly coming out.,
