yes so it depends on the vertical if you are in the apparel vertical the the autocomplete suggestions either product keyword category etc as with about thirty to forty percent if you are in a big department store type setting like Target Newegg it has been closer to 75 to 80 percent in grocery which is also another vertical that we work in is also even higher you have seen almost 90 to 95 percent at least in our customer example cases where the autocomplete usage becomes extremely poor and I'll show you why that is the case also but it all depends on the vertical I don't want to say one statistic that works for all it's different for different verticals the bigger the catalogue more the in interaction with the autocomplete so we work with new egg just to give you a scale idea work with newegg dot com I'm sure you get a part of new egg it's a four billion dollar pure online play company and they have just shy of a hundred million products in their catalogue that is grounds for tremendous amounts of autocomplete opportunity of our customers just essentially start looking for autocomplete but if you now look at target dot com for example you're still experimenting with autocomplete with them but what we have seen so far is because target is a department store with so much cross categories not as big as a catalogue they don't have 100 million products they have a couple of million products but they have lots of different categories they have almost 500 different sets of categories and sub-categories autocomplete becomes very important in that case too now we have only thousand or two thousand products auto-completed is not as important in that instance the usage does go down any other questions on Type-ahead .,
