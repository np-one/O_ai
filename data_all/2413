so I guess what's next would be the question and slide ten captures that a little bit where you know we don't typically say hey if you're interested in X it costs you know how many thousand dollars but what I want to pick their brain on is you know based on what you're hearing in slides and seeing in slide nine is there something that is of more interest and if there is what I prefer to do is just have another call where you and I can connect or I'm happy to come up to you guys offices and just basically walk through what that solution is if it already exists or what could something look like based on you guys needs are because I would think it's impossible if I were in your shoes to say ask you the question of alright like which one you want to buy but it's more of what are you most interested in where's where's the most relevant and we could kind of you know I'm able to come up there I can understand kind of your business needs a bit as well I don't have to use it that's I mentioned it before I got on the call but but I didn't really get full visibility into and work another conversation is you know what are your KPIs for the year what are you within that mark within that larger format space what do you guys trying to be struggling with what you guys trying to solve.,
