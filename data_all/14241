we've actually done a lot of a/b test in fact when I show you the dashboard we actually give you the ability to actually run an a/b test look just having text versus having text and visuals on almost every a/b desk you've done before we go live with every retailer we've seen that imagery has shown double-digit improvement in conversions versus text but again it can be very different for your business for Bed Bath and Beyond we didn't do imagery that was probably the only use case where imagery did not make a significant difference and indexing became a huge problem because for having imagery you also need to have an image of the product in bed bath with over 5 million SKUs they decided not to go with image so they still if you go to Bed Bath & Beyond and look at the auto fill function it's still texture.,
