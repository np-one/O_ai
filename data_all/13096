okay so Colleen from our perspective I don't know what your timeline is in terms of when you are looking to move but I'm assuming at least a couple of months away at least few months if not couple from what I wanted to sort of give you two caveats on what I had mentioned to you last time regarding you know crossing the five million chasm the crossing the five million chasm what I wanted to clarify myself was seeing when you are in Shopify platform the what what you want to be absolutely absolutely sure is not necessarily the flexibility of what you can do but the presence of a particular feature so let me explain what I meant at that time with Shopify there are a lot of features that are sort of button down for you right there's a certain path created for you like if you were to compare and I don't know if you're an iPhone user an Android user but if you're an iPhone user you might have experienced that you know it's a very best path sort of figured out for you it's a closed system you can't do a lot of a lot of manoeuvre but the path that has been figured out it easy for you to use right versus on Android it's a very open system and you can do a lot of maneuvering you can build a lot of you know deep poking apps and stuff like that and you can do a lot of stuff a lot of flexibility but it makes it for a complicated usage so if you want a very straightforward path a simple user interface like Apple and I may not necessarily be the most appropriate system from that perspective however the key to know that Apple has not only figured out the best path but has also figured out a lot of features versus Android may not have figured out the best path but it might have overloaded you on features ok so if I am a person let's say I'm an individual who's not technology savvy I just want to use a smartphone for the purpose of using it but not lose out on features Apple is as good as anything else but if I'm very technology savvy I do a lot of integrated things because I want to make the best use out of the platform Android is the way to go so when I was talking about Shopify Shopify is your Apple platform now we've not spent as much time on B Collen to really understand and see and that is this is something I want you to sort of discover for yourself because you will have unique needs outside of what what unbox provides as a service you know in terms of full fillment shipping lot of other things what the big difference between B commerce and Shopify you want to really look for is one does it have the features and what's the flexibility does it have for those features that you can customize the crossing the 5000000 chasm means that you still for example you talk about Express or ancient Greg or Ashley Furniture okay these are some of our customers these guys are huge behemoths enterprises is billions of dollars in sales online and offline right they still have the same premise of what they need to do online they still need to have fascinating the still need to facet shipping etc what they try to do because the reason they go to IBM or ATG is because just doing that particular feature let's say it's shipping and fulfilling they have a unique process of their own that they want to introduce that differentiates themselves maybe it's cost-cutting maybe it's whatever it is and those platforms allow them to do that that's what you need to sort of figure out whether big commerce allows you to do something custom that is very specific for you to go from five million to 10 million what you have identified that you need to do as as far as customisation to imprint your differentiation as a business for example your business might need let's say you need to not only sell on your site but you also need to sell on different it's different commerce platforms right our marketplaces and stuff like that I'm not saying that that is the case I'm just saying that's an example does Shopify allow you to do that there's a very straightforward path to do that or it doesn't even allow you to do that which has BigCommerce as allows you to do that that's a very clear answer you have to go to liquid commerce it's Shopify does not allow you to do that right but if Shopify and becomes both allow you to do that and what Shopify does is it's a very prescribed path and it does not work for you but big commerce allows you to customize you have to go through it BigCommerce so that's where I feel that you want to really focus on because unless you know specific things and and I'm not saying you don't know I'm just saying unless you actually go through the exercise of figuring out specific things that you need to do to go from five to ten and which platforms allows you to be flexible enough because of the differentiation you need to imprint on process to grow your business that platform is that platform does not support you in that that was the wrong platform now Shopify IV all know is a very closed system so it may have the feature but it may be a very prescribed path if you just want to start the feature I would absolutely suggest go with the prescribed path because if you try to customise it without knowing what you need to customise you're gonna spend a lot of time and effort and a lot of heartache what we've heard about the commerce is that it has a lot of features just like Shopify a lot of them are closed also but it has some more flexibility then like I said we've not spend enough time to do that to really know the big differences between the two but as far as I know they're very similar in that sense with some differences in how it might be flexible so I just wanted to make sure I add those two cents of what I had said last time to clarify because I don't want the last thing I want you to do is evaluate a lot of platforms pick one doesn't work out for you and you blame that that point when moodle set this that idiot you know so I just want I absolutely am clear on what I was trying to say there.,
