and there you know we've looked at a bunch of them I can see that the price ranges from you know but maybe $100 a month for 250 or 500 dollars a month or something like that so yeah I mean I think that at this point it doesn't really seem to make sense for us to be paying you know $250 a month for a search because we're just not gonna uses that much and the other thing is that I know that a lot of the new search engines probably like Unbxd have a lot more capabilities than what would be included in Google Site Search but on the other hand because we're not a Magento site or something like that we're probably not going to be real able to take advantage of this I think so.,
