okay this is part warehouse we have two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance with their pieing the parts form so parts used to have two types of search boxes one for parts one for models and they could only optimise one at a time so we came in and said you obviously cannot have two search boxes one because you're putting the one of on the customer to what is the choose the wrong search box and three you can only optimise one at a time so we combine the two search boxes into one and this is what our autocomplete looks like for them we actually split it into two where left shows with parts right shows with models and in parts you see the part numbers and model with model operates all right I'll just type in Tyson here's another customer in apparel customer for them what we've figured out is that they have a very big catalogue and very deep catalogue so for them as soon as I type in my first lever and we want to try to guide the customer to the categories that you already have show some popular products based on that loose relevancy ever with one letter obviously but also show some keyword suggestions based on that and these are all obviously and syllabus also says that these are all dynamic butts or our stand in the nature that it's based on user behaviour and over time it changes based on learning from the system this is the last example I want to show you is a grocery customer for them it was in grocery world by the way customers buy a lot of products in a single transaction right I mean if you think of your own grocery run that you might have done that he you buy 12-15 products in a single transaction the problem this customer faced was it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these 15 products so we redesigned the autocomplete to look like this where we didn't shoot hearts to this the left hand side part is actually personalised to each user based on cookie data and based on their past behaviour so what will happen is under the assumption that in grocery most of the products that you buy are the same products that you might have bought last week or the week before or something in the past right so as soon as you start to type something in we show you the products that you bought in the past up front you allow you to change your quantity and Add to Cart from right here if you're looking to buy products that you normally don't buy we show you some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some category and that is what our reflection was in your search that if I was starting to type in headgear why is there no mention of a country right because I'm assuming since you put nation as the first thing I'm assuming folks come in looking for country bottom first is that correct assumption.,
