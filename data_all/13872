what Google will tell you is that that search session or that visit with Site Search had a conversion which is true but unfortunately misleading yes I searched in that session and I bought in that session but those two are not correlated what Unbxd does is we do a one-to-one correlation if I search and I don't buy from search that particular purchase does not get attributed to search so you can now actually tell that that query is not performing well right so based on that philosophy we give you a lot of reporting and analytics to to see and get the insights so .,
