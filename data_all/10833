it is exactly powered by us everything starting from sort by down is powered by us here.  okay cool that sounds perfect to me.  yep I understand what you talked about that so yes so that is absolutely doable now I'm assuming the only question that I have is what would we do so the one one trick we could use is let's say sort of the structural stuff stays the same but the colors and stuff can slightly be manipulated depending on the style sheet of each of the domain that is using here.  for example let's say structurally the block looks like this and you have choose options with a it's a green background or the price with the red color but let's say one of the site uses this pink predominantly then they could create a style sheet where that class can be with a colour pink and this will automatically show up as pink.  so we can rely on that customers class but that means that that customer needs to have that class in their stylesheet.,
