so I'm saying after user abandons the cart I'm sending an email and I'm waiting for one hour for the user to complete his check out either he'll complete the checkout if he completes the check out I can send another email saying okay giving him a summary of his cart or whatever he's purchased on time out I can send him a push notification on sending the push I can wait for some event and then on time out I can again send let's say a browser push and after that I can again introduce a wait time and I can go on creating this particular journey with multiple touch points.,
