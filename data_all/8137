They have two kinds of visitors on the side today one who knows exactly what part number to buy and others who know what model number right and before we came in they actually used To have two different search boxes that they used to use I'm just trying to see if I could I can find that link but yeah what what they had was two different search boxes and the onus was completely on the customer to choose the right search box may be by partner or by model number no we came in and we said what if customer chooses the wrong search they would not be guided to the right product this is obviously if you see mystery in search hence we came in and we built something like this the moment I start typing in the BIssel now on the left hand side you see all the parts for bissel on the right hand side you see all the models for bissel and some of the top searches for the same. Here is another customer of ours which is tactical they selll has the most popular brand some of the most popular categories within Nike Nike easy night vision night 9 line apparel of the other brands and their categories which are popular some of the top queries starting with NI on the right hand side start showing me some of the Nike popular products not just that say if this week this 4th black boot became more popular then this boot would go on top and others would come down the order depending on the popularity and that's that's where the machine learning kind of kicks in tries to understand the user behavior and then collects a lot of analytics across the site by every each and every visitor that comes onto the site per product per query and then and starts manipulating these results trying primarily promoting all the mooting Products based on the probability of them converting. Here is another example for express say the moment I start typing G shows me because for expresses A brand what was important was categories so say jeans for men women with rice blue in legging now here you see red jeans again based on popularity based on based on the crowd behavior on the site right last week when I was doing this demo it used to be a blue jeans but it looks like Christmas is bringing in red jean popularity on top and that's why Red jean on top fo men in slim in slim as what does showing up here right.,
