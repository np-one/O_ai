if you search for the GPS units and they were shown jackets in the same and to definitely abandon the search at this days or something if I did not have relevant results this is again how they react what words do they use to tell us so this is our interpretation of what they would actually do a field by that stuff now please big change to search for you to just GPS and we're showing relevant results the single word queries work but two word query seemed to have a problem seven remaining users who initially in site search switch to navigation no specific tasks here for site search for the above look anything one of the eight users wanting to look for motorcycle parts for his Honda CBR 600 R but the typing CBR space 600 RR and we're certainly shown irrelevant results here again change the query to cbr600rr one <> shown relevant results so there is a very lift tolerance in terms of again site search seems to be the one that comes up another wanted to look for gloves but missed eyes the corneas gloves and was shown the result got it okay another wanted to look for cheaper jackets on a search results page they wanted to sort the result page on price notify but was then shown irrelevant results but they just wanted to find cheaper jackets but it's gonna be sorted based on low to high and it was only not shown any jacket so that's again from a relevancy perspective it seems to be coming up and again and again okay next is product comparison stage so somehow they've actually narrowed down the specific set of results that they want to look at again any of these methods that they might of use any questions by the way Lauren I know I'm going very quickly and dumping data but any questions so far.,
