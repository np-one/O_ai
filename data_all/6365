now let's say you wanted to have different pricing say for example you wanted to have different pricing for different zip codes I know that you don't today but you want to have less cost pricing might be slightly different than East Coast in Northwest etc whatever the pricing might be you can have different pricing you can have different inventory for different locations like for Ashley Furniture they have 250 different pricing based on because their business model is they shift from store right so if that store does not have inventory and you are within that zip code you don't want to necessarily show those products that are not in inventory right.,
