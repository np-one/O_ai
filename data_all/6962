but if you look at how the idea of ranking works or the tf-idf is just basically the term frequency inverse document frequency this is how the scores up here right and that's why you find deserve and products when you have it by this technique right and the reason is because they only give you some values a popularity score a verity score there is no usefulness or the context of the in commerce actually being available and that is something that we add which we call it as a relevance game where for the same use cases women white and jeans we understand that jeans is the most popular product in the e-commerce context then it's women then it's jeans so we are actually adding something call us relevance game to be already available published idea of course and hence the essentially display products for in at stage one we push products which are not relevant towards the bottom and then we finally do exclusions of taking them away right.,
