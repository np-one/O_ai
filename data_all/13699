got it so you can see that you have tons of products where the idea is not all products will have exactly the same keywords but you want to make sure that when this is where the customer searches for it all the products show up rather they search using a belt or the word belts so in solar the only way to solve this problem Solar comes out of the box with some stemming solution but you have to essentially create synonyms on the back end so you'll have to create belt is equal to belts or belts is equal to belt in order to accommodate for something like this so when a customer is searching for Juli belt you then also have to create a synonym for Juli belts or belt and that's why but solar cannot differentiate a search query versus a synonym and that is why you see these types of search suggestions and also you can see if belts and jackets are the most popular search suggestions the products are only showing t-shirts okay the one on the right you can see here again and this is not a corner case that I found it shows up all over the place I started to search for security badges or security anything and security batons etc and you can see it shows me a lot of badges in the search suggestion again singular plural all over the place but again in the actual products there is no relevance to something like that if just showing some security related products but completely different set.,
