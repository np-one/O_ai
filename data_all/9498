Let me show this old site of parts warehouse so parts warehouse they actually sell I would say home appliance parts right and the kind of users they that visit this site they search in two ways. One either by the part number or by the model name or the model number of the appliance that they have and then they start looking for the parts right. And before we came in they used to actually have two different search boxes for these two different kind of visitors on the site. One to search by the part number and one by the model number we came in and this I could <> this is how it used to look like search by part and this was search by model and this is an old version of on their site.,
