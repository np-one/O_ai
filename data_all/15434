So let's take an example say dress as an example and this is what my search results for dress looks like on this demo site I go to the backend dashboard I create a rule I click on merchandise and will open up in a window that will show you exactly the same results that you see you saw on the website in a visual form right. So this way your merchandising team will have access to this visual merchandising tool now you can filter based on any attribute that you have shared with us in your catalog you can promote you can promote by sorting boosting or slotting so let's find boosting real quick okay let's categories you have very few products or for some search queries you have very few products you just want to move them around you can just drag and drop them and pin them so if you want specific set of products to show up in a specific set of order and just drag and drop and pin them. So now if you go to the site you'll see exactly what I curated on the back hand shows up on the website well the Eliza products up top and the two that I pinned in the first two positions. Now let's say you wanted to do something slightly different where you wanted to slot or organize a particular position of the product so let's say in the third position for some queries you always want to show different brands so let's say for the query shoes or cheap shoes or her fancy shoes or sports shoes whatever the maybe you want to show one adidas one Puma one Nike shoes okay you can then define each position or a range of positions and define a rule so let's say for position three I'll say I want brand that contains Ralph Lauren so now in this third position I'll always get a Ralph Lauren product so let's say this particular product goes out of stock goes out of inventory or becomes inactive the system will automatically find the next most probable out Ralph Lauren dress and replace it here so you can always define what particular block of product listing what type of brand or product or whatever rule that your merchant wants will show.,
