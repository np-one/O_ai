How how do you ensure what you want to show in the first fold because typically again more than I would say sixty percent of your visitors will not go across the the first fold on a search results page right. Whatever they see on the first fold is the most important set of results or more likeable to buy. So now here these set these I would say products are again based on popularity if this week this boot is more popular they start showing on top right sometimes you can override it through our merchandising dashboard and you can say that the first two products should always be my new products right. We can tune the system and we will give you the control the back end control also to do this and I'll I can maybe walk you through today or maybe on our next discussion through our back-end dashboard as well.,
