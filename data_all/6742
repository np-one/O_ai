Got it so I'll give you a couple of examples Chandra I think this was Chandra asking the question I'll give you a couple of examples of how we address a bad data because I mean obviously we can't address all types of bad data but I'll give you an example with US Patriots so US Patriots problem was that the products that they had it's you know three armed three divisions of the military Army Navy and Air Force and you can't combine some of these products when you're starting to show results the problem they used to have is they did not have good attribution data for example color was always in the title but never as an attribute some types of size some other types of attributions like installation etc what we were able to do was when we got there once we got there catalog if there was a very logical reasoning behind extracting attributes so they'll say oh these are the types of colors you can get these are the types of attributes from installation or weather resistant etc that you can get we were able to extract that and then create those attribution and give it back to them so now you we can now power the facets the filters the relevance is lot better etc so there's some extent to which how we can help improve the data and that there's obviously a third party's whose bread and butter is to do this like index I don't know if you guys have heard of them there's a couple of a couple of them out there and they do this as a professional services where you give them their catalog your catalog and they'll give you back an attribution based data that becomes if you have lots of problems but if there are some peripheral problems or some problems that can be logically solved we can certainly help you guys do that as well as a first level hopefully hopefully that answers your question Chandra.,
