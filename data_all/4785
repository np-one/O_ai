So this is the first interaction right someone looking for for products and you start guiding them from there very first few letters that they start type in but then post that or if you look at is the relevancy with regards to the way these different elements the first thing I looked at on your site was the error tolerance people tend to make a lot of spelling mistakes when they come from smaller screen tablets or even a laptop when we tend to type fast right people tend to make some mistakes and I try to I've assisted at the same behavior to see how relevant the results were and if the site was able to automatically correct and show me the right set of answers right so I misspelled mirrors with a single r it gave me zero results then I misspelled chandeliers and again it gave me zero results right with us what we have done is and and traditionally the way this is this is being solved is the the search companies expect you to create huge libraries go look at what are the most misspelled queries and create redirects or use libraries at the back end but we automate this experience we have built a solution that can automatically correct 85 to 90% of misspelled queries on any site right and and a search query of up to six word with one sorry two alphabets misspelled in each word can be automatically corrected by Unbxd right here is an example from Express black leather jacket all three misspelled with one alphabet missing not not only automatically corrected but we immediately start showing the relevant results for this query.,
