Okay so we're in a primarily an online retailer we have a physical store but this is more like a statement where we do sort of showcase our products currently we have only one physical store here in Copenhagen but we have existed online since yeah say early 2001 this will the journey where we started so we've been in the game for quite a while and slowly growing um we football specialty so our customers are primarily football players because like the most of the products we sell and by football I mean soccer in case you know so primarily young kids who actually play football so this is like football equipment and you know training gear we also have a lot of collectors people who like you know collect a limited edition kind of things if you know any people who like sneakers you also there there are a huge group of people who will just collect limited edition football boots. And we're quite lucky to be one of the few retailers who actually get to sell some of these products that's like the main driving point but overall our website is like more content driven we try to do things not like a traditional retailer website you would see like you could see like like we try to tell stories about about the products and we educate the users about okay this kind,
