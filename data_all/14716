Okay great so parts warehouse they sells vacuum cleaner parts or other home appliance parts online before we came in they used to have two different search boxes for two different kind of visitors on their site one who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the model of the home appliance and are looking for parts for those particular models right. We came in we said you can obviously not have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to select the right search box what if they select the wrong search box. And also at the back end you're doubling the problem of optimizing two different search boxes all together so instead what we built for them is something like this. The moment I start typing in the cell on the left hand side that you see all the parts for the cell on the right hand side all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for cell. Here is another customer US Patriot Tactical they sell military apparels to US citizens for that for their site brand is very important and you'll notice the moment I start typing in Ni it opens up Nike one of the most popular brand on their site starting with Ni some of the other some of the popular categories within Nike and then Nite ize or Nite Glow Gear some of the other brands which are equally as good as Nike. On the right-hand side start showing from the popular product this is dynamic based on the popularity the the order of the products would change so say if people are clicking on the fourth product more often the fourth product would come on top and the first one will go down based on the popularity.,
