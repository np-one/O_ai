Same thing I tried for filters right tried fitler interchange the T and L it automatically corrects it and starts showing me the right set of filters right now this is something that we solve out-of-the-box you do not have to do anything we can automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabet for misspelled in each word right that's the strength of the auto correction algorithm. Around 85 to 90 percent of your search query would be automatically corrected by the search algorithm without you having to do anything right here is an example black leather jacket all three misspelled right with a with an alphabet missing in all three we automatically corrected and start showing the results without waiting for the customer to click on something any any questions here.,
