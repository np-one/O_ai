one thing that celebra stood early on because we were coming from default Magento solar search which as you know is a complete joke it actually making hinder sales because I mean it does hinder sales but it might it might be like the reverse the antithesis of search it's so bad we were you know if you if you if you were on our site and one of our sort of marquee products or our antique guns specifically the martini-henry rifle so you could search the term martini and like the first four results would be the parts for them the two sort of like what you were doing and then the the thousand dollar rifles that are like what we're best you know the things we want to sell would be below the fold and so celeb rose and what we don't what I have a staff of 12 I'm one of the only people that works on the site and the last thing that I have any time to do is to go into Magento and manually weight rank of products for search I just did not want to do that I wanted user behavior to determine and plus my own knowledge my product catalog to say this is also what I want to feature first so celebra has made a rule where antique guns if they fit into the search query would be weighted more heavily than anything else which really helped us I'm imagining that type of we're going to do that with unboxed as well.,
