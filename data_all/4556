so the idea behind that now is how do we create these collaborative groups create these user groups to figure out what the buying patterns look like then there's content base this is your catalogue based stuff which products are actually selling well what geography do they sell well in now there's differences right you have t-shirts that could probably cross customers but then you have certain parts that can only be applied to certain models I mean there are certain parts that are universal also but you have to be able we have to be able to separate and segregate out the catalogue to understand when I'm looking at a spark plug for a particular car I'm not sure that Mercedes let's go bad but if there is something I'm looking for I can just suggest oh here's other spark plugs you might be interested in right it's it's not like that if I'm looking at a dress I can show you some other dresses but that's not the same with parts it has to be very very specific to that model.,
