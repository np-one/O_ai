okay all right awesome so let's get into the experience aspect of it so when we start talking about site search you can see here with the visual autocomplete as soon as I started searching for men's pants you can see what that experience looks like it very very textual very textual in nature we believe that this should be much more engaging especially in fashion and accessories you want to give your customers the ability to quickly engage with your products and so I'll show you an example so here's an example I express my comic search started to search first a jeans you can see how quickly we started to show jeans and then we also guide the customer so the function of the autocomplete is not just to put some text out there the function of the autocomplete is to engage the customer gives them a sense that they're on the right path so to quickly show them some products that you have that are best sellers best performing products but also guide them so if I'm looking for jeans for women if I'm looking for jeans for men first are looking for very blue jean jeans white jeans etc and experience can be so quick that I actually hover over any of these you can actually see other results would change depending on what I'm clicking on and this solution also needs to be machine learning it has to learn exactly from the catalogue from what the customers are using and try to predict what the customer might be getting into so when we look at jeans there were jeans for rent men and women but now when I'm looking at dress you can see the dress is only for women we're not necessarily coming in and hard-coding those types of elements for both men and women when it does may not exist so that's the visual autocomplete component.,
