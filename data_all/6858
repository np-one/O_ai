correct so you guys are Niva you have a Niva plug-in I don't know if you worked with Alex from Viking coders that Niva but they are the ones we work with where we built a plugin so the plugin pushes the catalog to us catalog feed and then depending on how you want to show the search results the category pages is set up we just hook into it from the back end where you're able to now render those results the calling Unbxd and either using Ajax or otherwise and for recommendations it's definitely an AJAX strategy where it's a it's a widget a div tag that you just put on the other site and that's it so it's a pretty straightforward fully six weeks roughly the time it takes depending on how much customisation you want us to do also obviously but we work with a lot of similar customers like fashionable panes cables dot com etc and so integration is straightforward because of the plugin.,
