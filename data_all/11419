so the majority of the work is done by my team not yours all you have to give us is the catalogue so you give us a dump of your catalog and you integrate our analytics which is probably less than one day's worth of work and the third thing you do is you give us this access to this page so we can configure this page and the results around it and so some back and forth would be might be the design so let's say you we come in and say this is what the autocomplete we did for Express if you want exactly the same kind then it shortens the time if you want some new design then there's that back and forth on design we'll design something you'll review it you'll come back and change it we'll do it again those are some of the times that takes and then we add some testing into it as well.,
