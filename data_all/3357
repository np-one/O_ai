okay so what we did was and I think unfortunately we we should have done this slightly differently we should have picked one of the subdomains because here there is no search box per se you have to go to a subdomain to actually pick one so we did actually do that I believe at some point so to make sure where did we go so there was that yeah I just want to make sure that we did a good job here because we then give our team a specific set of instructions to talk to the customers with or talk to this focus group with let me walk you through what we've done and if there seems to be some gaps here we'll run the test again but no please when I give you get to the feel for what this is and what we've done so far so what the premise of this is that we want to make sure we we figure out how your users or your customers are actually discovering products on the site right and and our strength is that that is what our expertise is to understand and decipher what the issues might being with product discovery .,
