I would recommend you to have a support email address which is the former option that you suggested because that will give you a platform to which you know all your customers can reach out but you also do have the option when you're added as an agent for from your agents email address if you forward any of your emails which you get from your customers to your support email which is lens craft and that will too create it ticket in freshdesk but with the original sender as the requester of that email and not yourself right so if you go this setup or with the former one which you suggested you'll have both the options of you know having accessing your gmail account to create tickets as well as you know your support address so I would suggest that set up Darren.,
