No problem sir no problem so now what I want to do is quickly show you how our dashboard looks like so this is like an overview of our dashboard here depending on the catalogue you send you can send us the your catalogue from either put it on an FTP location. Or you can actually send us the catalogue by a CSV by an XML or JSON once you send us the catalogue or we pick it up from the location that you've placed the catalogue we will show you all the products available. We will show you the feed size will show you whether it's indexed or not indexed we can manage all your sub-domains or if you have a testing site a QA site the production site everything you may manage right here right. Once we pull all the fields from the catalogue it will all be displayed here you can then enable disable the fields the way you want this is where you can we will show you all the filters that's available in your catalogue.,
