Okay awesome so stemming right I tried a few examples so I know that <> is one of the I think brands or kind of a product that you have right so I tried to type that without the space didn't work gave me a zero result page then I look for another product which was a polyester guzzler bag right I tried that with 60 inch as i n c h and then I tried it again with sixty double quotes alright. And you see the difference because the system is not able to understand that that's the double quotes in on this particular query actually refers to i n C H and that's why I'm seen in one case I see two products in the other case I see ten products right so we again automatically solve all of these stemmed issues. Could be singular plural words could be words like say game gaming center central could be some of these symbols or abbreviations or even slang that at times right system is automatically able to understand this without you and your merchants having to do anything at the back end.,
