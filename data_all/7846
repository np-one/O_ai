The specific function is the data analysis of the terms so okay you know my team is I run the SEO teams so what we do is we take our knowledge of understanding what the customer is trying to achieve via the search terms and then we work with the merchandisers and product management team by looking at each you know piece of data for the search terms and see in where we're not helping the customer meet those objectives it could be typos that are common and or it could be that there some things are searching for that are no longer available so we need to kind of redirect them to a destination where they can find an alternative product things like that.,
