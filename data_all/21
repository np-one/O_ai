yes yes that is interesting to me now one one one other question other thing I want to point out huh which you may or may not be aware of the we well we looks like we have traditional categories and we do the way in which our navigation works is every page as a search results page so if you if you navigate traditionally so go hover over militaria on the on the header and go to original antique guns hover over that and then go to clean and complete antique guns and okay so this is actually a search result page if you search clean and complete antique guns this is the same thing would come up.,
