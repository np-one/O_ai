available in there we actually show that image and not relativity and we do that because we have a colour synonym corpus builted in back end it understand which are the primary parent colours you also understand all the child colours associated with that. so we built it because you have a lot of these cosmetic brands to work with us and for them attributions like rose and Arctic and sky and may be very very important so we have to resolve for these specific child colors or we don't have a rose color at least show them a cherry and red which is more relevant for me than for them show them blue and black. okay .,
