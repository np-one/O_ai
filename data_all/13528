correct it is in the search resul ts engine so if I search for the one Alexander way yes next is dynamic filters so you have a lot of different categories of products you have from electronics to apparel to cell phones etcetera so for different categories of products different filters will make more sense and from that perspective you want to make sure that you optimise the customer experience by showing them the right set of filters for the right sort of category so Unboxd also gives you the ability to do that if you want to define a specific set of filters for shoes you can define that and the search system will automatically show that if you define driving for shirts defined at once third system will automatically show that.,
