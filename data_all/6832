yep exactly so if you look if you look at the original reporting that we did so let's say either it's a query or category I have here we were using a grocery example but you can see how we were able to track the funnel how many times did somebody go to that category page how many times somebody clicked on that category page what was that click number look like how many add to cars happen from that funnel how many actually ordered from that Add to Cart both that conversion rate look like and what was that actual revenue in dollars from that category page so we create that one-to-one correlation to actually see how the customer went from top of the funnel to the end of the funnel from start to finish so that you're now able to correlate that so let's say and when we talk about product recommendations Mary it's not that we are talking about I want to make sure I'm clear it's not that we're saying somebody comes to maxi dresses and we show like four recommendations at the top this entire page is RRe-sorted so right now you have 11 product there is a restoring of these products all 11 of them based on what we seeing is the best performing product that should show up up top.,
