obviously with all the with like six and a half years of maturity that the algorithm has seen in right it's it's gone so over 200 million products it gets about two and a half billion search queries every month so we are algorithm has become smarter and smarter and it knows almost every permutation and combination that happens when some word is misspelled in every vertical so it cannot come auto correct itself like even things like if you look at say a t-shirt I could spell it as T- shirt or T space shirt and somebody else can probably a youngster might come and say look for tees the intent of the user is not changing ultimately they both want to go and look for t-shirt so you see about 500 results now I go and look for tees essentially a similar number will show up that's because the algorithm has seen enough iterations of t-shirts and tees and multiple ways people will be looking for that information it can recognise that and it just not does this it can also solve complex natural language things like when you look for a dress on sale right,
