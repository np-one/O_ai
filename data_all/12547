our recommendations as well as the search I think the best way of approaching this would be we get your team to do the recommendations because that's something which is very straightforward and all you need to do is you know add an analytics integrate our Shopify module get the recommendation up and running and just put in some of the bibtex snippets to actually get the recommendations live on your site and post-trial any of the design changes and all of that can be taken care by your team or through our recommendation that's what it says but I hope you'll follow these steps in a bit as well but in search it's going to be a little I think if best if our team gets involved and gets the search up and running because for Shopify the plugin that we have automatically takes care of the data feed which we need to get but some of the other elements for search like the facets and the filter is the way the search testing page should come up you know getting in our autosuggest and all of that it's best that we actually get our team to interpret or the search piece for this so I think we just walk you through the recommendation step first and then move on to the search.,
