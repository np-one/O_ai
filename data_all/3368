say I attained an aggregate around 50000 but on a per store basis I mean they could be it vary wildly so I don't know not sure.
 but then gone in and AT&T have some significant number of products like a few hundred.
 oh yeah absolutely.
 G dot and ATT dot all right so let me just give you overview as to what we did here so task one was highly specific me give you a specific task let me look at the customer response and then we give you task 2 say noise cancelling headphones then we look at customer response and the customer response is essentially looking at it and saying did the customers search or did the customers use navigation or did the customers click on some banners and stuff like that and then if task three is low specific look for anything on this on the site for your choice right so what do most customers do in that case and then the idea is that once they get started on this journey how how do they follow through or the interruptions that they get so that's where the selection stage comes in here for highly specific where we said expresso coffee maker you can see from a navigation perspective what will the reaction be then four or some okay and then then we'll have the medium specific task we'll have the navigation for it again and then we'll also have search and then whether in super see here even for navigation it seems like there was some issues like over Plantronics may not necessarily sell headphones but they do sell headphones do they.,
