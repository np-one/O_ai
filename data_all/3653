something like you know inserting scanned responses or you know a certain things like that so those who are the extra ones that you wouldn't be able to do but then if you're looking to maybe update the ticket properties or reply back to the customer forward that ticket all that is definitely possible and of course you you also have this option with the phone channel to accept the calls via IMobi in case you're off the cubes or on the field and not available to take calls on the browser you could definitely go ahead and do that too.,
