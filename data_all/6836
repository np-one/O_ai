exactly so let's exactly so let's say if I'm a first-time user on the site I have no history on the site then we use some implicit signals like we're where are they coming from what time of the year are they coming care what time of the day they are coming in what are other users where similar signals what have they done and what other products might be trending in general to combine those data signals to show the best performing product in front of them now if I start interacting as that individual I start interacting with the results batch so if I look at this results and I say you know what I want to look at I mean you only have 11 products on here so they can just quickly look at them but if I wanted to just look at a colour if I use filters on colours are useful for some price maybe I sort based on something every single click that you do starts to build a user persona for us and we start then using that persona to make sure that no matter where they go on the site we start showing products pay for that.,
