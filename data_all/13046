no I just wanted to here the two parts a column that we had prepared was one was we understood that the storefront catalogue was incomplete but at least from the structure perspective you wanted to give you an idea that what does it need to look like for us to be able to provide the faceting for you and which may also necessarily be true for BigCommerce by the way so that step may still have to be done the second part is and how we can help you with that the second part was we actually found some articles on Shopify to walk you through to say once we do this exercise for you from processing your catalog and building up the attribute columns how you can take that and put it into the Shopify app to make the faceted navigation possible so as I said faceted search faceted I'm sorry and the other piece last piece I just want to add is while BigCommerce search may seem out of the box there's a lot of limitations around how it actually behaves which is what US Patriot actually wanted to use somebody for this particular function because out of the box it's not very not very intuitive it makes it a naked enables it but the look and feel a lot of the other functionality are still very limited in that sense which is not necessarily any e-commerce platform strength by the way you goes with Magento you go to BigCommerce you go to ATG everybody out of the box is pretty if they're the more they have the breath right they don't have the depth in a particular vertical which is why we've ATG you have products like Endeca or with IBM web commerce you have products like unbox again there or with big commerce so let us walk you through the Shopify piece and then if it is the same thing as possible in becomes at least you now know so if there are other benefits to the commerce that you are more interested in that doesn't have anything to do with unbox you can make that independent choice and know that no matter what direction you go what's available and what's not.,
