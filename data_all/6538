so that's where personalization is moving that's absolutely true but what we realise is that when we put the extreme personalization components in front of the merchants and say this will all be taken care of by the algorithm the merchants I like I don't trust the algorithms I will never trust the algorithm because how can the algorithm know what my business needs are I'll give you an example and express every month they have some amount of code out of sales that they have to hit right so in that instance what their challenge becomes is that if they're on a 20th of the month and they know that they're running behind their sale quota they're gonna run tremendous amount of campaign for the next ten days and in that in order to do that they might have to do some sales they must on clearance they might also have inventory quota that they have to get rid of how can a algorithm know that a certain business requirement like that come in you can give it to say you always make this sale quota and then start figuring out if you need to start dumping inventory dumping price changes right the Louie Vuitton when they sell on some website they actually don't want when a customer searches for some dress Louie Vuitton does not want their dresses to show up unless and until customers search for Louie Vuitton dresses. see this is this type of control for business requirements business needs we believe the two have to be there we want the algorithm to get better and better.,
