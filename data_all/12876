yeah I mean we've struggled with that ourselves we used to do a little hash tag that would or a little description thing available more colors because we weren't able to show the more colors we wanted people to know that I mean what if we said we displayed up to four or five colors anything more than that meaning it's okay they capped at four or five whatever whatever works the right way and then we just assume they're gonna click on it if they want to see the more colors .,
