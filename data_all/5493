I'm sorry what was that no okay all right product comparison states so here users were happy with the product details and reviews shared by other users so that was very positive they found this information useful in defining a lot of the product 10 out of 20 on users were looking for similar products at this page the site shouldn't mix suggestion which further confuse the users so if I'm looking at a harness slight plus against this is a source of armor protection the suggestions may be more complementary rather than alternative so the idea here is if a customer is on a product detail page they're showing an intent because they're interested about something about that product but a customer could be in two stages on that product detail things one they may just be evaluating or second they're very interested in that product if they're evaluating you want to give them the opportunity to evaluate other alternatives in case you have not decided on it because otherwise what the experience really looks like Lauren is with me let's say force will harness so let me just so here I'm starting to go into the particular product and I may have an intent to buy it I may not have how can I get other products that may be similar in this nature may not be from that same brand but similar in nature so that I can evaluate alternatives because otherwise my alternative is either I go back or I restart the interaction either by navigating or by searching again I hope that made sense I in terms of an experience perspective so the reason you don't want that to do you want you don't want that customer to do that is because if a customer is creating any unnecessary extra clicks the probability of them converting on the site decreases by 10% with every click so if they have to do four or five clicks certainly the probabilities half in half and it's been very hard to come back out of that aspect so giving the customer and more alternatives to continue their journey on it's also very important okay check out page so here on the check out page customers did want to see some complimentary products so and that is again depending on the business that you're in now if for example today if I'm buying a 350 dollar product they feel remind me you don't want to truly describe the customer by giving them any kind of recommendation on this page let them just finish the conversion right and then maybe on the Thank You page you can tell them oh by the way here's some other additional accessories or anything complimentary that you can buy this is that the theory Lauren to the two natural recommendations of the checkout page.,
