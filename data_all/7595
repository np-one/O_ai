So I'm sure you understand the importance of search but one of the things that I wanted to highlight on this slide was that One of the researcher by Jupiter says 80% of your visitors will abandon a site after a poor search experience and the reason is they are so habitual of searching products on Google or Amazon finding the right set of products that they expect all e-commerce site also to behave in the similar way and hence if you are not able to show them the right products for a search query they would just believe that you don't carry it and then they will just ignore or again slide back to Google or maybe a competitor.,
