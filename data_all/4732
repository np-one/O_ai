another thing that I wanted to show is all these spell checks and relevancy that I showed you that was not working on the site so what what we've tried doing this since the engine is context-aware we want to auto correct most of these aspects instead of depending on your team to correct it manually so that we reduce the effort in your team like say the word but black leather jacket if I misspelled all the three words I could say B-L-C-K-L-E-T-H-R-J-A-K-T misspelled all the three words incorrectly one of the key things we do is one way with auto corrected if it's misspelled and we'll show you results from the word code and you don't have to do this manually.,
