if I let's say do camisoles works with Cammy very different sets of results if I do error correction if I search for fragrance and made a typo I see very few results compared to what is actually available and again on mobile I don't think that there is anything in particular that is being done on mobile in terms of the experience today I have to click on the search box to open this so this magnifying lens to open the search box but even when I search it's not guiding me to quickly get me to where I really want to go so what are the different components in terms of why should we be considering this type of experience second I'm gonna switch back here okay so to summarise this is not a query problem right you have hundreds of thousands of unique products you have lots of queries each month it's not possible to correct every single one of them and the behaviour is very distinct based on different variances so so personification for example different geographies different devices customers buy very differently how are we going to show the right set of products for right to the query on different variances so that's what Unbxd really brings to the table.,
