however some of the ideas that we have found are definitely applicable in mobile as well okay now there are five different stages that we measured customers on discovery stage selection comparison check out and return the caveat here Lauren is we are not experienced in the entire e-commerce what you might call an ecosystem what our expertise is and our experiences is in product discovery and when I say product discovery is how do customers buying navigate discover products on the site two different stages so where why we say the checkout stage it's not a question of did the channel take too long or it had too many steps it's more about were they able to find product during the checkout stage okay so that's what our expertise in and that's where our experience can actually come in and come in handy and say okay this will the experience from the customers perspective was it right or wrong a wall we couldn't tell you even if it took a very long time to check out we don't have the expertise or the experience to really make a comment we may comment as a customer but that doesn't mean anything right so I just want to make sure that did that caveat you were okay with it but that's what we've done actually.,
