first I started looking some relevancy perspective one of the things which we tried doing here and when we were building our products other things you try doing differently there's most traditional systems including solar if you look at that background of all being primarily for document search not necessarily for an e-commerce product search and what we have tried doing with our relevancy the algorithms is to make the algorithm a little more ecommerce context aware and we've actually passed the algorithm with over 200 million products so that it actually understands when you look for the cells to point to 1997 vacuum cleaner in a parts industry versus a 2% on site dairy milk in a Las Colinas yes - what is the search string actually mean and how do you actually identify products in that search going so that slightly differently as we've actually approached building out the search platform itself . right so I found some common use cases from our relevancy perspective I started looking for motors on the side this is essentially your navigation page where it essentially gives me and guides me through what exactly I want to find within motors and this is how the search shows up right and then similarly I look for accent cabinets you obviously have this within your navigation section and producing a bunch of options to choose from in terms of manufacturers and type and model but again when I search for it it's probably not giving me any option all right then I'll start looking for some specific products on the site look for the surface mount amplifier you have about 700 odd products actually available on this site but from a search perspective probably what it's doing is it's either doing an ending or a or-ing or a minimal match so it's either returning too many products or too few products so from a search perspective it looks like it's a little bit broken overall then look for some non-rechargeable batteries you obviously have under batteries non-rechargeable ones more than 100 of them but again I searched further to the search box I don't find many there could be multiple ways why we the search is not showing these kinds of results a it could be there is probably only mortal number searches that actually happen on your site and you probably don't have feature based searches that actually keep Keitan so that is something that foggy I can understand from you but I just tried three to four different variants within search just to this to see if there is an opportunity for us to work together.,
