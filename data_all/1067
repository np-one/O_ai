what we mean by that is we make the whole data injection process automated we try to make sure what factors go into the models we try to make that more transparent if there are data science teams within the organization we give them some power with our tools for them to be able to play around with some of these things - the predictors and the variables which are going into the model some choice of what kind of models to be selected and if it's purely business users we kind of hide all these complexities from them but what we give them is the power of simulation right to be able to do certain kind of what-if scenario kind of analysis.,
