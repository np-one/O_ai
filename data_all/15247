You can drag and drop and then pin product in particular position and it's as it's that simple and then this is still more of a product level pinning now say if I was to do a very high level pinning meaning in position 5 & 6 I want dresses by say Ralph.  Now the 5th and 6th position will always have the Ralph Lauren dresses even if this dress by Ralph Lauren goes out of inventory this will be replaced by another Ralph and and on the live website you will notice that these changes occur in real time right.,
