you don't have to do anything even then it would perform better than your existing system that's what I meant because see what error tolerance comes default you don't have to create synonyms you don't have to create synonyms for stemmed words it'll autocorrect right. and the relevancy itself is built so strong that you will automatically start seeing results then as it learns as it as you also understand and become more comfortable with the system then you can start probably making these smaller minuter new two changes where you can probably define a specific set of attributes for a filter facet all that can be done along the way in the next twelve months. you don't have to do it today but just the foundation of the system is so strong that even without doing anything you start seeing increasing conversions.,
