okay from our end you know the way the implementations are a lot easier in Shopify and it's very easy you know whenever you're trying something new it's a lot easier to get those things implemented within Shopify than it is on a big commerce the same thing for field upload a lot of the times when people are using big commerce they are using a lot of other third parties to get their catalogues sorted out and you know then they try and slowly build across within BigCommerce whenever but ya more from this is more from the implementation perspective because I know that the big commerce dashboard also has a lot of different things which may excite you from the perspective of adding new products there and so on but what we've seen it's a lot easier to maintain a Shopify site just because of the way they handled having different templates you can always have a copy of the live template make your you know technical changes there and then make sure that you actually take that life you don't lose any data it's pretty easy to switch from one snapshot of your production site to another without really losing much data so everything is a lot more seamless on Shopify than it's on bigcommerce.,
