next is if I went to search for gloves and then filtered it by men's as a category I get about 114 results but if I search for men's gloves I only get four results so this is the difference in relevancy is to how a customer might search they might use a keyword and use filter they might not use the filter and use that filter in the key word itself the search queries context is going to change tremendously if I search for t-shirts with - t-shirts without a knife and completely different sets of results and all of these by the way can only be solved by creating synonyms on the back end and solar next is spell check so here I search for shorts with the dropping an o and head wear by dropping an A and you can see does not give me any search results again you have eight thousand products 100000 SKUs there is no way this is a scalable solution where in solar the only way to solve this by the way in solar is again to create synonyms for every permutation and combination that's available okay so you'll have to do shorts without a know without an R without a t without a light all the different types of permutations and combinations and you'll have to do the same thing for shirts because shirts you might drop an eye then how do you decide do you do shorts or do you do shirts spell check do actually show to the customer or Jewish or both and it's not a scalable solution I don't know how large the team is in terms of who manages the catalog or solar but even with 8000 products and the descriptions that I've seen and the categories that have seen I'm assuming that that is not a scalable and which is why some of these simple single word misspelling mistakes are not corrected today okay so Type-ahead we talked about search results we talked about any questions Christine and gentlemen okay I just want to make sure am i talking about relevant stuff things that you guys are experiencing today am I talking about the right kind of opportunity I just want to make sure I'm.,
