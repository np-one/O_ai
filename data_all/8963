What is it that people are clicking more what is it that people are buying more we are able to understand that and change the order of products in real time based on that popularity not just popularity but also Geo-location say there is a particular boot which is more popular in New York versus California right. So obviously someone coming from New York would want to make sure you show them the boot which is more popular there versus someone coming from California you want to show them a particular boot that's much more popular in California right so it also brings in Geo-location any typical festivities in in those particular regions right. And then we start showing the relevant results and this is all dynamic and in real-time and that's why I said right the more time the system spends on your site the better the conversions get right so if within the first 90 days say you might see 10%. But within within 180 days you might be looking at a 20% increase in conversion right and then at the end of the year we're still looking at at an increase in conversion on a monthly basis right so that's the kind of technology that has been built with regards to solving relevancy.,
