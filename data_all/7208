You can right okay so one of the core focuses of this call was to essentially give you a quick background who we are I know you would have heard about us in the webinar as well but then very very specific and focused on Willowtree look at the product discovery experience on Willowtree today and also share some common use cases of what we've done for other customer so that there's something for you to take back to your team. And then we could definitely spend some time on showing you how we can do merchandising again you might have gotten a high level snapshot on how we do merchandising in the webinar but we can probably dig dive a little bit deeper and speak to you about that.,
