So we also have a product recommendation solution which is again automated right which is again on machine learning popularity primarily on four things popularity wisdom of crowd on turn based personalized it's a 10 widget strategy right so with the search what we do is we implement these two widgets just for your zero results pages but if you're interested in a recommendation solution we can also implement 10 different widgets across the site starting from homepage your category pages search results pages add to carts check out at your PDP pages and to primarily upsell or cross-sell products. To primarily upsell or cross-sell products. And this is again something which is automated this is not a hard-coded solution we do give you some controls at the back end so you might want to come in and say for anyone looking for a product from category a I want to start showing them products from category B right but which products will be shown is again something that's automated which is based on the analytics in terms of what people usually buy together what what people usually view together right within the site and and based on that we'd start recommending the products on the site I can show you some examples and then again the UI will be very in sync with your site but then the idea is hand pick just for you maybe we were able to gather information this is a repeat customer we know what they looked at in the past on the home page itself we can start showing some of the products very similar to what Amazon does today on their home page. Popular items these products could have been popular this today or maybe for the week for the month we can tune the duration the idea is to start showing popular products on the site for first-time visitors on the side who don't know what what they should probably looking at on the site what are the kind of products they should they should probably buy on the on the site right. They start showing some of the popular products PDP page someone looking at this bracelet $65 this particular style color we are able to start recommending the products which are in the same styling which are probably the same color same designers could be at this at some times right you give you some new controls in this could be say someone looking at a $65 obviously you would not want to start recommending products which are $200 and which are say 5 or $10 which is a huge difference but you can come in and define that start showing products which are plus or minus of 10% in price or plus or minus of 20% in the price point. This way you you start showing them products which are maybe within the price range but from a styling perspective and then from a category perspective pretty much is something that's that's automated you will not have to do anything you can you nearly start showing some of the similar products on PDP page.,
