But with Unbxd it starts getting resolved automatically right but if you have if you are in a specific industry where you have to still build something which is like an industry jargon. Like we have a customer who sells weightlifting gear and in their world shoes are called lifters right there's no way Unbxd can recognise that. So if there are any specific jargons on your site we still let you build synonyms you can build a unidirectional synonym you can build a bi-directional synonym or a replacement synonym. I'll show you the example on dashboard as to how easy to build these synonyms right but apart from these specific cardinal cases generally you don't have to build any synonyms or stemmed words or spelling mistakes which will resolve automatically on the platform.,
