Got it okay so I didn't think it's coming up a little bit muted so I probably caught some of the words okay so I'll keep up the pace and try to show you everything that we wanted to show you today so let's get into the business section we talked about the technology at a high level let's get into the business piece I want to give you guys a little bit of a preview as to how do we come up with the user experience from different verticals just give you the idea on the capabilities that we have so here's an example of a customer parts warehouse a huge a huge success story out of Texas you know so they used to have a very specific requirement they sell parts to appliances and they started out by only selling vacuum cleaner parts now they're selling parts for all different appliances that you can find inside a home so they have two different ways or two different types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have right so if I let's say start to search for say this side as a vacuum cleaner what we did was we actually split the search results in the autocomplete to show parts on the left and models on the right so depending on which user they might be they can go either left or right it's a very different way of implementing stuff here's an apparel customer US Patriot tactical or even if you go to express dot com which is one of our large customers we have a very unique way in terms of how apparel customers need to be engaged where if I start typing in say just ni for example how I want to make sure I start showing some of the most popular categories or products and provide different subcategories within that but also expose them to some products that they might have not thought about that are also available and sold on the site some top queries and some popular products that match the query string and all of this is driven by a machine learning algorithm that actually learns over time and starts to provide better results and here's another example of a grocery I know this is not necessarily strictly to your vertical but I wanted to show this because there might be a lot of repeat purchases on your site customers are coming in just to replenish maybe food or maybe medicine etc so this might might ring up ring true to you what your requirements are so what I wanted to show here is let's say if I started to search for say a chicken or this is what I typically buy from this site and if I am constantly buying let's say this chicken nuggets that is the first thing I'll start to see at top now specifically for grocery what we found that a lot of customers were searching going to the search results clicking on the product detail page and adding a product to cart right so what we found that if you bring those three components right here in the autocomplete we can show you what the weight of the product is the price give you the ability to change the quantity and Add to Cart from right here we can cut down on the number of clicks it would take for the customer to buy and by doing this design we were able to bring the clicks from 60 clicks it took to buy 15 products down to 20 but in case you're coming to buy products that you normally don't buy we also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories okay and this is just the autocomplete thats it okay next is the 12 the query types of relevance we showed you the example of how from a technology perspective we solve the the query relevance issue but what we've also done is we've written a master algorithm that actually understands the type of queries because different customers have different concentration of types of queries that we get so you might have a exact query or query spectrum that essentially defines what is the range of the product that you're looking at are you looking at a very specific product or a type of product or not even a product a query qualifier has keywords in it but actually ascertain a specific definition of that product say for example I'm looking for a blue collar for dogs right so it's blue is the feature that is defining for the collar that I'm looking for and query structure defines does it contain keywords that are used for natural language are there some linguistic shortcuts like I'm looking for a 60-inch TV let's say an electronics world etc that inch I could define as double quotes in inch etc right next is our spellcheck so Unbxd has actually figured out to solve up to six keywords being misspelled in a single query and we do three things we obviously autocorrect it so here a black leather jacket for example is misspelled we correct it to the correct spelling of black leather jacket but and we will automatically will start showing results for black leather jacket in case black leather jacket had multiple Auto Corrections we'll also start showing those the third thing that we do is let's say we thought that black leather jacket has the first option for auto correction is what the most obvious is but customers start clicking on the second option over time the second option will automatically become the first option our machine learning system will learn and figure out that most customers are looking for the second option and that will become the primary option next by the way this is solved out of the box you do not insulate today I'm assuming Conner from a business perspective and for the tech guys you constantly have to create synonyms for all the different variations of misspelling you do not have to do that with the Unbxd solution Unbxd solves 85 to 90 percent of spelling mistakes out of the box without you having to create any synonyms only when the customer really <butchers> the spelling where we have to actually create a synonym on the backend for that same thing with stemming today I'm assuming that for a lot of cases you have to create synonyms on the back end you do not have to create synonyms to solve stemming problems with Unbxd it is automatically solved out of the box and but we also give you the ability to create synonyms so if you have plural stemming issues spellcheck all of that is automatically solves but you have some synonyms that you want we can also built in and give you the ability to create the synonyms and we give you the ability to create three types of synonyms bi-directional synonyms where you want to make sure that any keyword being searched you search for both keywords you need to replace synonyms and we'll show you some examples of that and some replacement synonyms automated redirect if you give us your taxonomy if a customer searches for something that matches exactly to a taxonomy you can automatically redirect that customer to that category page you do not have to create redirect rules manually within the system Any questions gentleman.,
