yeah exactly and knowing these product it's not like a paralytic you can say  dress his address on the top of the top resistor is not a resistor if one from the other and so understanding that will take a little bit of time so the owners is more on us with your guidance but from a technology perspective I'm pretty confident Tim will come back and say this is this is pretty easy to do now even if he comes back with something that says it's gonna take longer we understand it will respect that and we'll work through whatever the timeframe is I'm assuming that as long as I can get this price point it's in this range there $500 if that's an acceptable range then I think that we should be we should be okay as far as whatever we try to deploy it I will.,
