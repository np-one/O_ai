Yep and I'll also send you an implementation approach document we can do implementation in two ways because if today you're using SOLR or Elastic search we can mimic the same response that your SOLR is given today to your application or your Elastic search is giving to your application so that it will be a very simple integration. It's a simple API that we will build out we'll give you the API you will have to just integrate that or we can also do an in page Ajax kind of a model where you create a page and give us your header footer and an empty div tag and we can do a HTML injection. And we can build all the conflicts in our end so irrespective of in each of these cases either of these cases actually we can go live in four weeks and then you would have two months to test the product out to see if you're actually getting a business impact out of this.,
