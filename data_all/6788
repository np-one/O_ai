right so we can't guarantee on a fluctuating fluctuating basis Mary because let's say Q and I increases prices or you have some inventory issues whatever either all of our control what we guarantee you do a POC you do a test 60 days or 90 day POC within that time frame which we demonstrate this off sick so that establishes the price point and after that you can continually evaluate us but the price point does not change because there might be certain instances where it's out of our control so we can't guarantee it obviously but we can guarantee within a 60 day time period because we can estimate that there won't be tremendous variations around it and within 60 days or 90 days we could guarantee that time frame I did something and during that time frame.,
