Okay so I'll tell you a drawback with Google Analytics or any similar system it's right so I was to come onto your website start searching something didn't find it then I start navigating through your website and eventually buy it but when you go back to your Google Analytics it will tell you that this was a search conversion.  The reason because it started as a search but in reality it was not a search conversion because customer could not find anything through search right and it was actually a navigation conversion so those are the kind of challenges that we overcome with our reporting.,
