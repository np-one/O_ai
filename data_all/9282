Right so it for us to be able to run the test what what we'll have to do is ultimately we'll have to implement the solution so we'll have to implement the solution on your staging site you test it internally first in terms of how these search results are coming up right and then if you want to put the live traffic on Unbxd that's when they'll have to start looking at using optimize basically you need to split the traffic that's the idea of using optimizing . But prior to that Unbxd has to undergo the complete implementation of site search on the site and so I can send you a quick guide in terms of how how easy our implementation is and then we do the complete implementation work right I would say 90% of the work is done by our team ten percent of the work done it at your end . Mostly with regards to testing and some of the accesses like a Nivo merchant access and some of the business decisions in terms of designing those auto suggest pieces and stuff. So that's where you would need the help of your team but then complete development work is done at our end designing work is done at our and then we implement the solution on your staging environment and when we are ready to take it to live that's when we would run that through an a/b testing platform something like Optimizing then you can decide how much traffic you want to push on on Unbxd. And I can send you some more details or an email as well.,
