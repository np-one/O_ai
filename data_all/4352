So the first thing we looked at was autosuggest autosuggest if I would say is really good today it starts guiding the customer to certain suggestions to start showing some of the products right it's visual which is really good the one thing that it that can also be added to this start guiding the customers to maybe some of the categories if someone's looking for my for say Nikon is that a camera that someone is looking for is that a lens or is that a maybe a case right or some of the other accessories right so next level in terms of how you can start guiding the customers I did notice for camcorders you were doing that you are showing categories but then again you might want to start guiding them per brand as well there are various different brands of camcorders that you would have you can also start guiding them across brands right so that's that's only another way of guiding the customers or exposing the maximum number of products that that helps them get to the right product as quickly as possible and let me not bore you with these slides and show you a couple of examples of our live customers in terms of how we approach the auto suggests piece.,
