So we have like from the month one the POC fees would be applicable that's the only fee that's applicable I think I mentioned to you the overalls for the first three months will be half your monthly fees or actually we'll be looking at a costing of about fifteen hundred dollars a month for the first three months. I can calculate that and send that to you you're looking at an overall expenses about five thousand dollars in the first three months that includes the setup includes the first two months and then by end of March you can take a call whether it's actually making sense to you.,
