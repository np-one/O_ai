Well the way we work is the daily sign of the contract or kickoff the project right even if you sign today and we kick off the project on the 1st of November see the billing starts on 1st of November we start the implementation the implementation typically is 6 to 8 weeks right so though you are still paying for the six to eight weeks on a monthly basis and that kind of takes care of your implementation in cost the 1750s I mean is this kind of for the first month in the second month which includes the implementation cleaning of the system taking the sight live from the the moment we go live right we do not take care of your we do not count your search traffic on so but you will still continue to pay 1750 we will not look at your search queries or search sessions how many are getting even if you get say in instead of 25000 for that particular month even if you've got 50000 sessions you're not being billed for it right. The post 90 to 120 days which is something you control all right you can come back and say 19 years or say 120 days of us having kick get started the project if you are happy then we get into the one-year contract if you are not you can walk out or if you want to extend it by another one month you can also choose to do that so then we kind of their kind of flexible. But to answer your first question the implementation cost the six to eight weeks you pay the monthly fee that kind of takes care of the implementation.,
