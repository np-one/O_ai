Got it so Chris one aspect of it and I'm just trying to Strategies in place to to improve this on top of Endeca I don't know what the timeframe that is I'm assuming it's the next step next quarter or so assuming that things worked out good for talk quarterly is there an opportunity one after that quarter to reassess and say okay if you've done this let's see the improvement any because that's new benchmark right if you are able to do some improvement yourself that becomes a new benchmark that you can base off of any any comparative technology. The second piece is because you are not going to go through the spellcheck piece yet is there an opportunity maybe sooner to come in and say okay we we make an API call to Endeca you get zero results and maybe at the same time you make an API call to Unbxd with our index of catalog that we can give them and we do get results we get zero results for Endeca let's show Unbxd results we really show something and try to overcome the the spell check piece or maybe the stemming piece any time you get a no good results or you have low performing queries. Let's say for example the longtail stuff your freaky three words or four words etc so very something very specific to leverage that aspect of it with your existing catalog and then maybe in the meantime you are still continuing to improve your system could that be some sort of an opportunity for Unbxd to come in and help where you know you're not gonna be able to spend time for the next quarter or two.,
