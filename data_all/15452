Looks good I mean so so far I really like what I've seen it's it's quite interesting and some of the challenges that we we know we have and we would like to solve it elegantly but you know we in e-commerce which we cover a lot so there's a lot of things that's going on and it's not always that you have the terms like really focus on two things alone and and realize all the potential there isn't in things like making the search work really well looks like you guys took your time and actually internet so I like that a lot. But I'm one of them curious about is like how so what is your product exactly so is this like a hosted solution of some sort or is this something that I can install or is it is it you guys helping us build this on Solr or Elasticsearch how yeah what is the product.,
