thank you I hope I took enough time to answer that question but I just wanted to make sure that while all of these other things are quite possible the reason I focused on site search was primarily because I saw that you probably were using a vendor for recommendations so maybe you were not so interested in switching you probably were doing certain things for navigational I wasn't sure what the back end platform was so I thought what I couldn't tell looking outside in it's definitely an opportunity and I understand you're not looking to switch that either but that's what I felt had the most most opportunity in terms of and what are the other things I wanted to also share with you guys just in case it is we have composition and how we do prices are very competitive and very affordable pricing one of the big is the ability to test this right so let's say you've obviously put in a lot of effort time and effort in to the solution that you have today but the question is how can we make sure that you're not just all all talk we can actually walk the talk as well the question then comes in is how how can we test this so we would come in there's two pieces that we do one is if you we can sign an NDA for this if that's what's required we will come in and do a discovery analysis to come up and figure out a way to give you guys an idea of what is possible as an opportunity there it is so here I can show you this example and this is just random number so please don't read into it okay so let's say your current site statistics might be 250000 visits per month that search etc right and you have three percent conversion rate let's say your average of the value is $100 and that's what your current revenue is we would come in based on the analysis if you get access to some analytical data I'm assuming you guys use Google Analytics is that correct assumption.,
