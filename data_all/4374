So to show you an example Canon SLR cameras right when I look for Canon SLR cameras shows me good set of results on the first fold as a customer maybe I want to look at the cheapest Canon SLR camera and that's where I come here sort the results by price low to high and immediately I start seeing some of the parts or some of the cables for the SLR cameras so ensuring that now this by doing this way I as a customer will never be able to find the cheapest Canon SLR cameras right or I will not be be able to find this easily but I might have to put in an effort to now go through all the set of results and understand which Canon SLR camera would fall into my budget same thing for say Canon SLR cameras if I was to do price high too low looking for the most expensive Canon SLR cameras again start showing me some of the lenses and not the cameras by themselves.,
