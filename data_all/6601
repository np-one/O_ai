Got it so the there's two components to that our machine learning algorithm has been trained on what we call is the world catalog so we we have created an index of almost 250 million products to train our machine learning algorithm however once that machine learning that algorithm is deployed on Petco it gets trained on the Petco catalog and then over time it is learning based on the Petco analytics and clickstream data and any variations to the Petco catalog we do not and this is a big no-no in the retail world we do not take your data and mix and match with any other retailers data to train the algorithm it is definitely based on your data and your data alone.,
