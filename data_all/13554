there it is one you Sado up anyways so I mean obviously there's there's some issue in here picking up the Spanish language but let's say it was showing that Spanish sentence so wherever it's picking up that data from today right there's probably a Spanish version and an English version of the catalogue we're always picking up that data from if that's what it's going to send you the data so Magento can then choose and say oh it's in Spanish I'm going to Spanish column or <> it's an English it's in English column.,
