Alright so the next thing is let's jump back to my website so go to the home page or are you are on the home page now okay all right great alright. So when the customer comes to our site they're not not logged in or they're brand-new customers they're looking at this page but if they come back to our site and previously logged in and they have a cookie they actually go to a specific page for their industry. So I'll give you an example if you go back up scroll back up move up okay and click on providers and click on podiatry p o d okay so in my business it's all medical supplies but there are different type of doctors. And so sometimes the recommendations are universal it doesn't matter which doctor type of doctor you are you'll be able to use the same products but sometimes the recommendations really need to be specific to the type of doctor you are.,
