absolutely.. great great just let me walk you through the journeys piece I think because I I was not aware that we have less time in hand let me just show you so that we don't we don't miss out on the most important feature that we have.. so this is a journey designer so there are four modules here okay triggers actions conditions and flow control.. triggers would is anything anything in any of these particular options here would allow would would start a workflow for a user it can be user doing a event that is clicking on a button viewing a product page checkout started added to cart and so on or it can be user entering a segment or exiting a segment okay.. so I can say user when enters a particular segment okay yes or I can create a segment on the fly where I can say create new segment and I can specify the option here.,
