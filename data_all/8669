Yeah my I guess the the answer would be that to do it in English on corner case the amount of work it would take for us to set it up you know that call sounds simple for you but for us we have to go through a bunch of middleware or another thing that it does become quite a complicated case And unless that is a significant amount of money quite frankly just not worth doing I mean we've even looked at translation the same way where we we've had companies come to us say well your site is Japanese but it's in English and we'll do it for you and it'll just be one call but I'll tell you to set that up and get it working in a business environment which is already overloaded unless it is worth a ton of money it's just not going to happen you're not even gonna make that priority but there's too many others too many bigger things in front of it.,
