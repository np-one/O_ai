So sometime between the 11th of November is when that integration will be complete now we've got the we're selecting a vendor to do the design and development of this site you know there are some things that we we have two other sister sites that we want to use or that we are using like for like look and feel for H org and 4-h center . They both built on WordPress and certain things like the header and the trays and things like that are our items we want to mimic for our new site. Right as well as things like you know making three pages and product pages all look like they're part of this cohesive brand . So that's what the the developers were working on realistically we we have a budget for that which I'm not able to disclose to you but all of the proposals came back well above our budget and largely because I think we over scoped the user experience side of things we really just want someone we're gonna kind of do mostly UX stuff in-house when it comes to basically when it comes to information architecture . And then we're going to utilize the the agency for you know design and development and QA realistically given the change in scope that we're dealing with we probably wouldn't have the design agency start working on something until the first week of October so like sometime between the 3rd and the 7th of October because they need to we need to adjust the scope then the vendors need to come back with their revised presentations and slash proposals and then we'll be able to decide from there and also find out if we need to request more money from our capital stuff . So so those are the mean realistically that's our timeline and that's kind of the long vision is we've got the design work starting maybe the 1st of October the integration work completing that second week of November and I don't know when the best time to start up with Unbxd is given those different things.,
