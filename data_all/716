all right so this is based on acquisition source you can filter users so this was user section in segmentation now coming to behaviors this is where you will play around with most of the permutation combinations and you will create very filtered segments so any any user landing on your site would be a part of your funnel okay so first would be users who have let's say signed up successfully and who have not yet made a purchase all right.. signed up successfully not yet made a purchase or you can sign up successfully but not yet added anything to the cart okay or you can say added to cart but not completed checkout now in add to cart you can add a filter where whatever product is added to the cart its attributes will be listed here so I can say a model or category is equal to and whatever other product categories listed on the site would be available in this drop-down here.,
