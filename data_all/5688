so parts warehouse has two types of users one who does exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have so they used to have two search boxes one for parts and one for models we obviously came in and said you cannot have two search boxes because one you're putting the onus on the customer to what is they pick the wrong search box and three you can only optimize one search box at a time so we designed one search box for them now if I'd start to type in Dyson you can see that the left hand side shows hearts and right hand side shows models for Dyson okay so that's how we design the autocomplete to look for them this is US Patriot tactical by the way they're also on big commerce and you can see here if I now start just type in Nike let's say Nike banking products you can see how I quickly start showing what Nike products are available in tactical shirts tops undergarment etc boots some top queries and also some popular products to give the customer a quick idea of all the different products than 90 might have if I'm searching for boots you can also see a lot of different ways how we actually find boots now the interesting thing that I wanted to show you was is that the filters that we talked about Cal if you remember on the navigation the left hand side filters were only departments and price right so us patriot it were had also same problem the problem was they did not have any kind of faceting information available all of these facets that you see the toe type I J and their width shirt shoe size etc was all created in collaboration with their team by Unboxd so we actually help you extract some of these values to create good and good filters for search results now it's important to know why should we create that is because a customer when they're searching for certain products might see hundreds of them filters not only help them narrow the results down but it also gives them a quick overview of exactly how and what is it that they met the results contain right so they can quickly see ok all the price ranges this all the colours are this this is what I have in my search results this is what I may be able to narrow the results down by okay,
