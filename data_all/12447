yeah exactly that's why I wanted to sort of figure out is if we and it's okay that we don't do it before the holidays and we do it after that's totally fair I just want to make sure that if not that you're making a commitment that if you have interest will you be able to move quickly enough will or so that I can move quickly enough with you guys and if there is an anticipation before the holidays that's all I was looking for if there's not if they're still up in the air we can take play by ear whenever we get to that point I'm sure there's a cut-off time we can or can't do it and we'll take the decision accordingly but we're more than happy to do it either way just wanted to get a heads-up from you guys so that's all.,
