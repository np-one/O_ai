got it okay fantastic so deborah lippmann is out of New York where purses out of Texas shindigs out of Indianapolis pura-vida out of California sylveon out of Georgia these are all pure online customers but let's get into the specific five phases of site search so let me just show you first what are we talking about when we talk about site search okay so the number one thing we talk about site search is the ability to show the customers a type-ahead so let's see if I start to type in screen protectors you'll see that I see some options here like for product options I'm not sure why any of these four are coming up because I was trying to type in screen and you can see trying to show me some other products maybe the screen protector right here might make sense however the idea of the type-ahead is not just to show some products okay the idea of the type of head is to actually guide the customer to a lot of different sets of products to categories that they might not have otherwise looked at and for also to try to figure out what is the most optimised path that a customer can take in order to make sure that we can guide them to an actual conversion okay so that's what a type-ahead does and today the type-ahead from your perspective is not necessarily it's not necessarily taking that particular path and I'll show you some examples of what I mean by that okay so that's number one number two is these search results so let's say screen protector let's search for that now you might have more than two screen protectors by the way so I just want to make sure what a hits third if .,
