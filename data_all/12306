and you know there there is a it's interesting I saw what's powering the category pages I think that there is some JavaScript and there's a sequel view that's being used it's it's one of the frustrations that I have with this height that I edited that so we'll see how that affects what it is you're trying to do if we have to make some adjustments there we'll talk about it that may may be a development thing but yeah I'm just I noticed your question about how the categories were being created and it's so it's still pretty much straight out of Magento but I've seen a couple anomalies in our site in the code so.,
