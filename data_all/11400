okay got it so by the way Express is also an ATG and we want to give you an idea of why this is not necessarily the best option because in apparel customers evaluated a lot of products when I come to see these particular earrings I didn't really like them or I may not be so sure about them let's see if I really like them you actually want to show some other suggestions then go with that earring so maybe a necklace might be a good idea maybe a certain top or in jacket might be a good idea but what if I was not interested or I didn't assume you like these and I wanted to now evaluate the next one that I that you have in stock I now have to go back because I don't see any other option and to hide it again and then click here again and you can now see the challenge is it takes me three clicks to just evaluate in C2 products where is the experience you want to have is there continuously in the loop they come here they see other accessories or other group hearings or completing the look sort of the look book style or giving them other options there are similar to this one so other earrings and so they can continuously stay in that loop and you have the same truth in terms of tops so let's say if I am looking at this particular sleeve t-shirt you know what else am I looking at am I going to look at a dress am i right and I think this is probably a legging so maybe there's complementary products that you are showing but you also want to give them the option to see other similar products.,
