so we actually solve for both English and Latin based languages obviously a relevancy is much more matured for English it is picking up a lot for Spanish French in German but latin based languages the algorithm sill identifies so we don't have anything for two byte characteristics with this Chinese Japanese and all of actually still don't have anything on that but I would say we are extremely good on english we are about 80% therefore Latin based languages.,
