got it so as you can see there are specific queries that aren't working and the second piece that we also started to get into is the auto suggests so here you can see when I start to search for say draw a dog treat so even when I was starting to let's say go and just search for say bird you can see here I I see birds and then bird baths right now this is a problem because you have so many bird products and what is it not giving the customer is the ability and the feedback to go forward so here you want to tell the customer that hey you know what we have all these products but all these categories you are on the right path and I'll show you some examples of how we do it with others of some other customers .,
