Very similar order of of these facets right now here are a few examples in terms of how customized the facets layout can be but not only that from a technology perspective we can also make them very dynamic. And I'll explain you this with an example so say on an apparel site shoes versus shirts right they'll have different set of filters on shoes you would want size ankle height width casual shoe type fastening right various different attributes which might not be applicable to shirts. With us we can define that for shoes these are the filters that should show now in respect of how someone searches for shoes could be men's casual shoes shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even look for shoes they might come and say men's Nike men's Adidas as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category that being showed here the shoes filters would automatically kick in . On the same side if someone was looking for shirts the shirts filters would automatically click in right. That's one level of dynamicness. S now the second one is that within these filters say width became more popular this week people are clicking more often on width as a filter you would want width filter to be on top and that happens again automatically right whatever is your popular filter automatically starts coming on top and me the reason is say for printers the category filter might be very important but for ID card maybe the material of maybe the thickness might be more popular or maybe the price might be a more important filter.,
