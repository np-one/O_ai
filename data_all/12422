let's start with this okay so here's just to give you an idea from a business perspective how we really think differently for different businesses and verticals to give you an idea of the word totality of our approach so here's parts warehouse almost a thirty million dollar company annual revenue pure online they sell parts for different appliances they used to have two search boxes one for parts one for models we obviously came in and questioned that because you're putting the onus on the customer they could pick the wrong search box or you can only optimize one search box at a time so now you can see here just within the autocomplete as soon as I start to type in we split the autocomplete into two parts one for parts and one for models and this way we are able to cover both bases in terms of their customer behavior here's apparel world very simple very different catalog customers are more looking to engage in what they're trying to do so we need to guide them very quickly to category subcategory or specific set of products or help them with some keyword suggestions next is a grocery customer so here we had this customer who has users buying 15 products in a single transaction okay and the problem obviously was that it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these products so under the theory that in grocery you typically buy the same products that you normally buy to replenish your pantry every week or review of the week you redesign the autocomplete to look like this where every single customer gets a personalized experience based on what they've bought in the past so if I've bought if I bought chicken boneless breasts I'll see that up top if you've bought chicken without skin you'll see that up top and you can add two cards from right here and you also get to see commonly searched terms popular brands and categories to help you with products that you don't normally buy so this hopefully gives you an idea of how we try to solve different problems that customers face it's not a one solution that's designed for every single one of them very different solutions for different customers we also have from a relevancy perspective solve 12 different types of queries every single type of query requires a different algorithm to solve them next is spellcheck so we have automated spellcheck 85 to 90% of spell check spell check queries are automatically solved in today I am assuming Dan that Murrah marketing or merchandising has to create a lot of synonyms on the back end to accommodate for something like this all right yeah yep you do not have to do that with us in fact let me just quickly show you something okay here's all the reasons why you don't have to do synonyms and if you do need synonyms what is capable to our system so any kind of plural you do not have to create synonyms it's automatically taking care of any kind of stemming gaming game central center run running automatically done by our spell check automatic by us however you do want to create synonyms to create certain kind of business rules you do get the ability to add three kinds bi-directional unidirectional replacements and ends and we can get into some of these details in a longer conversation from a experience perspective we also find ways to guide the customer two different sets of products so here I search for mobile crosses a lot of different categories how do I find all the subcategories show them in the order of importance will also always show some products another interpretation I searched for Alexander Wang so here let me show you quick I searched for Alexander Wang who is it designer makes a lot of different categories of products which could also be the case where a customer is looking for an author who may have jaw on different genres of books so how do I show the results neatly bucketed into different categories but still all show all the products that that query matches so I show here all the tote bags made by Alexander Wang all the shoulder bags made by Alexander Wang then I can scroll down dresses sandals pants etc so a unique way to neatly bucket all the products in two categories or genres in your case four that are relevant to what the customer is searching for.,
