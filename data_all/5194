what unbox is coming in and replacing is just the database you're not replacing PHP so if the PHP slow we have no better you're no better than with unbox or otherwise if your database is well we are definitely going to help and it's a database is and I slow and I and my guess is PHP is not usually slow unless you're doing some crazy manipulation and even with crazy manipulations I have seen PHP is pretty fast so if your database is slow I would say tested with unboxd before you do the html5 because html5 is a lot of work tested with unboxd very quickly it should have it tremendous improvement in the number of seconds that you're gonna save which take in seven seconds today if it doesn't go to a second I'd be very surprised if it is the database.,
