But here customers doesn't shop that way she doesn't she's not as concerned about that level of detail she likes because I when I was started to analyze purchasing behavior and what she's purchasing there's really no pattern to what she's purchasing it's she cuz in one month she may only buy you know based on what we're offering her in that month collection. And I think because we put out new products every month she gravitates towards those very quickly so it's not like she shops for one button Blazers or two button Blazers or military-style Blazers it's just the overall aesthetic of what she likes it's a unique anomaly to this how she shops this brand.,
