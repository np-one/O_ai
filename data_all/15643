So to give an example why this is important say now someone wants to come and filter they can come and filter using any of the attribute of your brand of your catalog field or they want to run promotions sorting boosting slotting and let me show you say boost and let's boost a particular brand contains Eliza. So you see now all the aligned products are on top these are still dresses but all Eliza dresses are on top even within Eliza dress maybe this dress is going out of season and you want to get rid of the inventory and all you want to show it on top you can drag and drop and pin product . My internet is actually a little slow here you might see a delay. Okay just drag and drop and then pin product okay now this was a particular product that was pinned now what if I want to pin based on a product catalog attribute level and and we call it a slotting so. For example in position 5 & 6 I want a particular brand let me say now the 5th and the 6th products are the Ralph Lauren dresses even if this dress goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next best Ralph Lauren dress. All of these changes on the site in real time.,
