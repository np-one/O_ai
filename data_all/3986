All these products has red coloured as a part of their inventory but they're only showing the popular images and not the red dress that I am looking for. But with Unbxd what will happen is we've already built a colour synonym corpus at the back end and hence we automatically start resolving a specific colour automatically. Any questions so far sir.,
