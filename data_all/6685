Okay so Chandra this does sound straightforward obviously but let's say there might let's say for example the solar response that you guys get maybe there's some configuration change that you're doing to the solar response so the application is getting a slightly different response and we might not know that but once we provide our response you might say oh you know this is something you might have to do that's one second is the design stuff like I mentioned from a business perspective a third is any kind of work that we need to do from Unbxd standpoint to run the algorithms to run the processing of the catalog etc that takes a little bit of time a setting of the relevancy etc testing and then the last piece is the analytics so this gives you the integration to get us the catalog this gives us the integration for the search results but we also need to integrate the analytics and for analytics we do we take slightly one step further where we actually like to track every single click that the customer makes so there's there the deployment is straight for the testing does increase a little bit in terms of time.,
