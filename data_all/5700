so providing this kind of an autocomplete does not necessarily help endings what really becomes important for shindigs and this is what we are coming up with new for shindigs just to give you an idea it's something like this so here this is how we're trying to define the autocomplete so we are figuring out a way to shape show quick get them to quickly go to a certain area based on the time of the year so what we've noticed is that a lot of times certain months like graduation graduation is very important in May and June so when somebody starting to type in graduation or or anything along those lines so celebrations etc we want to make sure we show graduation up top during holiday season we want to show holiday seasons types that stuff up top so that's what the idea is in terms of how do we quickly get a customer to see certain things very quickly but it is not a question of giving them the ability to buy right from here because these products require a little bit of engagement the customer wants to see what this really looks like all the different elements of what the products should be they want to actually see and figure out before they actually make a decision to buy so that's why the experience is not the same as the grocery .,
