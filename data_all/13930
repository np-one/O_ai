so I Nik and I we talked sometime last week and we gave making overview of you know where we are coming from who we are what we do and looking from the outside in what could be the potential opportunity for us to and maybe come and help you guys Group Chenoweth and Nick what we were what I was planning to do today is maybe take a little bit of a deeper dive I'll do the introduction of who we are take 60 seconds for for the two folks for the new tuna folks and the then we can get into the specifics of the product the technology the features and some other components and I'll also quickly walk through some of the examples that we shared last time in terms of the customer experience study so I set the stage of exactly what we were talking about so that sound like a plan is there something I should do differently anything in particular you're short of it.,
