let's get into some of the examples okay so when I search for say lingerie on the site you obviously have lingerie inner ware etc but when I search for it it doesn't give us any result if I let's say search for men's pullovers you clearly have meant pullovers it's probably pulling in one man's pullovers the rest of them are women if I do a feature query let's say a white top it doesn't always give us a white top it sometimes being some white top but not all white top and I was looking at it just this morning preparing for this call you have t-shirts so let's see if I go to look at looks a and you have t-shirts and long sleeves but let's see if I search for t-shirts you'll see that I don't see any results now typically you might think and say well search is very small percentage of our traffic which is usually two for fashion maybe 10 20 percent of the traffic is going to be.,
