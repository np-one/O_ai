so yeah just just gotta show you a couple of examples around that piece let's say if I were to type in White tees so if you notice I get up 165 results and what we're able to do is we understand that t-shirts and tees to mean the same thing from an e-commerce context so let's say I go back I can type in four white t-shirts you'd see that the same set of products show up again and let's say I look for I misspell a query here so we can correct up to four four words in a search query so let's say here's an instance where I misspelled black leather jacket for instance l-e-a-t-h-e j-k-t so I've misspelled all the three words but the technology is able to identify the query and it's able to show the relevant results right from the word go.,
