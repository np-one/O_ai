no that's okay you currently know primarily sell shoes right it's not like you're selling accessories like say belts or it's only shoes yeah what do you see in the catalog errors all over so we have a category from women's and kids so you know when it comes to these product recommendations I'd like you know the system to identify you know if the user is only on kids shoes the only popular kids products for them and same thing for adults and that also a hybrid so you know that family customer that we have who will look for shoes for their kid and then also for themselves so how do how do you approach that I guess there's a question.,
