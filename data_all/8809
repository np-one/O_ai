Sure I can quickly walk you through one of the example I'm just Making sure I cover all of this so this is also the mobile piece right some of the elements on mobile very specific to mobile the fragile body the so on error tolerance right what you have also built is like I know you have fuzzy logic but then see a say on mobile what is also important is the key proximity errors I people typing O or interchanging the alphabets right the algorithm is also able to understand that ability to have multi select filters on a small mobile screen. Even the enterprises have not been able to build something like this but we give this by default on mobile. Then scope suggestions and recent searches which are highly personalized for each user on mobile here are a few UI element to kind of quickly show the alternative products a I like this product more like this I click click on that opens up a modal window here with some of the similar products I like the products i click on it i don't i close the motive and then go back onto the search results page. And then category refinement similar to mobile experience that i showed you in the for desktop say someone looking for shoes then within shoes could be men women boys and they can refine into each of these categories to see a limited set of results on the site. Now with regards to the implementation question that you have let me show you an example soUSPatriot Tacticle here so we don't go with a sub-domain approach right if i was to do a search for Nike on USPatriot Tacticle you see the domain doesn't change right the customer still owns the domain it is the same domain hosted by the customer.,
