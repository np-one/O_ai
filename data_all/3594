all right so that's typically how you could go about the shooter and in case you could be scenarios if you have multiple agents in the system and I understand that you are looking to have something between three to five you also have this option to add the other agents as what the those tickets so what this basically does is you know they could be scenarios where one agent has assigned himself to this ticket but it may be some other agent to who would like to know what's happening with respect to this ticket or with what's happening or what are the various actions that are taking place with respect to this ticket so in that suit scenarios they can come and add themselves as let's say watch us to this ticket and once we do that all the actions that are taking place with like to this specific ticket even they would be notified on that.,
