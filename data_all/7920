So that that is the home-improvement example like you can even even in apparel right there's so much of localization that you need from a personalization perspective because I'll give you an example so if you go and look for jackets on a on an apparel site so if if you're from say Chicago and I'm from say Tampa right A it should show you a thicker jacket B it should show you a show me a lighter jacket right and secondly you might have 50 thicker jackets in your inventory to show so what do you show it to you versus somebody else coming in from the same location so that's where again a lot of localization will be required.,
