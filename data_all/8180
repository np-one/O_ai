Okay. Got it so with us you can't surely do that you can get Set filters you can also set filters per category like meaning say for <> and the category you can set a particular set of filters now irrespective of how someone searches for grommets could be metal grommets wooden grommets just grommets and they might come and misspelled grommets which might get autocorrect it as far as there's 75% on more results are from a particular category that being fake or omits the grommets filters automatically kick in and that's what we call dynamic first facets that's one the second thing in your cases it makes more interesting is not sure what what filters you would want to show and in which order you would want to slow so we make the make the filters again dynamic to the next level then even say within grommets you would have five filters right here in this case they agenda size type fit availability right it's the right order for for this particular filter we are not sure right so we leave it on machine learning say this is how you have it on day one but but on day ten people are clicking more often on price as  filter right. The machine learning algorithm is able to understand that and automatically boost the price filter and bring it up on top Way to figure out the best way some . Some companies want to do that some companies don't so Express has their own own way of you know like as a foreign enterprise they have their own way of presenting this so they do not have a dynamic filter in terms of the ordering of this particular filter side and even even for the sub filters they have it based on the count on the product counter and a lot of times they want the most product count to be on top and that's how they typically show but then we have the ability to even say within the flame casual or or or say modern right why would you want this in this order so we leave this up to machine learning if people are clicking more on more often on the straight we bring that on top automatically and then others down the order so even within the filter right even first filters we can do that it is typically used for brands when you have multiple brands you have 100 brands that you carry which brand you would want to show on.,
