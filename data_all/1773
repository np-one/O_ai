one of them which I will talk about specifically in the data area and in a few of those in other application rapid application development areas and testing and so on and so forth and what we've also done is we've filed in infamy showed cadence we filed a significant number of patents in the last two two and half years of which nine has been already issued across definitiveness and primarily in the you know the new areas like mobility and wearables and IOT and so on and so forth and one of the things that we also decided when we started those journeys that we would start focusing our services primarily in the new areas right and in the areas that are causing disruption in the world digital destruction of the world you know anything that is digital lightweight mobility or variables or IOT or you know analytics or or cloud you know where we affect a lot of a customer's adopt cloud platforms to to enhance they're in a business value to their customers that's that's who we are as an organization and if you look at what we do you basically broken our you know our view of how we want to service our customers in four different hours the first of the towers it's on the leftmost is recall the imagine tower where we have come up with our you know set of services service offerings which is a combination of frameworks templates and ready to use platforms that help our customers have imagined the art of possibility right and you know kind of help them explore ideas explore new thoughts and kind of crystallize it and come up with some quick point you know solutions that can prove to the business the value of the certain idea right so we can help them building some that you know doing some rapid prototyping building in or doing some consulting or coming up with the digital strategy and certificate in that that's what we call our imagine tower our imagine line of business the ones and typically we nail in the long term engagement we we kind of go through this journey with the customers that we we ideally want our customers to start here so that we also can appreciate and empathize with the customer on some of the ideas or some of the thoughts that they may have and once we we kind of crystallized that we helped them you know kind of build the digital experiences or you know where but it could mean anything to do with building some IOT or we're in a solutions or variables or you know putting together some mobile mobile solutions and stuff like that or for that matter the last point in which i think is an imperial vintage interest for you which is around content and collaboration right so I have build those solutions and then at the back end also strengthen it with our with our engineering you know capabilities as well as our big data analytics capabilities right so that's how we operate as an organization primarily focused on enabling our customers to be digital right I mean if there are there are customers or doing business in the traditional form of a as we call it we kind of help them move to the digital world meet the new challenges the digital world and also help them you know strengthen their engineering abilities in the digital space okay that's how we are overnight any questions on that no I mean I'm looking over on the right-hand side to see I don't know if this is an example of and let's hold this to the end but of the kinds of companies that you're working with because I'm specifically I'm going to be looking at you know media type companies I see consumer technology slant media let's talk more about that when you going through the other two verticals absolutely absolutely love it about the work to be doing for this mean which may be of interest for you and the work that you've done in the India market with the one of you know with with a company called star which is part of which is in a part of networks you know Empire yes yeah.,
