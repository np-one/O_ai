If this works for your team right what I would request is if there are any slots available next week for us to have an implementation kickoff call ideally we need about 45 minutes <within> and I will send you what are the things that I need before that call primarily like I'll give you email ids two email ids for which read-only access to GA with your catalog files you can send this to us with XML JSON or even a CSV. Our team can start looking at the data and then we can get things started and I also on the fabula of the business side I'll put everything all the pricing details and a contract and send it to you like it clearly define what is your price for the POC and if you decide to continue with us from April 1st what is that will be your monthly charge and I can include all of them.,
