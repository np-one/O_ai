Yeah I think it's great I think that well we run into a snag but we're gonna have to do is because it's gonna cost ya you know if we start off with even just the site search that's a thousand dollars a month and because we're spending more than ten thousand dollars over the course of a year we would have to put this out to bid which is just not fun at all so we need to find three other you know two other people I think you look at home next topia and one other one here's we have to do it it's just part of our processes so the sooner we start that the better because that can take a long time as I have recently found out. So we'll do that I think that will probably if we were to do one or the other I think we'd probably do the site search,
