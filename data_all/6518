sort of I think if you're selling us that region matters and that mobile device matters then you should be able to take those other users purely with those intent signals and personalise it and I'm not saying that impact will be so huge but it's a lot easier for the algorithm to say oh look people from mobile who are into your here's our recommendation of what the product should be so now we're like two-factor personalization that it is for us to manually go in and set up oh look New York people really like this jacket in California people don't and then create all these other rules so I get what you're driving we know a lot about them but I'm still like pining for the machine learning to pick up and say these are true intent signals and to be testing and optimising in real time .,
