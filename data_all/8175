I think this I misses spellcheck that's Another thing that I wanted here was the spellcheck element. So I try to make you few mistakes while typing with typically use a behavior when they're coming from smaller screens or when they're trying to type fast and then then to make these simple mistakes a spelling mistake so say grommet with signal M gives me a few words person leather handles because I misspelled leather it still shows me some handles obviously the first one is not andle but shows me some other handles these two handles but not the leather handles you have a good section or a subcategory for leather handles wich would have been I would say showed here for this particular query then I misspelled brackets in panel brackets some of them are brackets but they're coming up because of the word match of panel and the others are surely not brackets right these are these are grommets sort of. So with us what we've Built is a spellcheck algorithm which can automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word and that's that's the strength of the spellcheck algorithm.,
