got it yeah we can start with the standard and then we can figure out once we get because also looking up from the outside and I don't know how much how much of that is possible so I just wanted to throw that out there.  that as a phase two maybe we can look at that and say okay can we what now that we understand what it is what can we do and what's possible or not possible and it may not be possible but it may be possible I just wanted to throw that out there.  so the hopefully that answers the second question from an integration perspective.,
