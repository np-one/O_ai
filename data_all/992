probably what I would say the one area where I just think think we're not lacking I mean I have a vendor I work with but I'm candidly I've inherited them they're not likely one of my first choice or anything but is to actually do the analytics and the one thing I've seen and it's not just them I looked at many other firms including the monsters like an IBM or something mmm-hmm is there's lots of smart guys there's lots of people with PhDs and statistics and so forth they can do you know run through an analytical exercise but kind of it's the really deep knowledge in a specific industry from a business perspective like the cadence of the business the structure the type of data that like the syndicated providers are offering good a typical output from a transactional system so they can understand the flow of information from supply chain perspective show them to the channel.,
