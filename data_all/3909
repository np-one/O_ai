yeah and once bulk email has been sent I can also bulk update all those fields let's say maybe comments I could add a comment saying you know I have sent an email I could have a comment field and saying campaign has been run on this particular date and automatically the system automatically does when you've last contacted also so that reduces the manual operation of when you've actually contacted so if you go to my leads or contacts page you would actually see when was the last time I contacted a particular lead or contact so this was.,
