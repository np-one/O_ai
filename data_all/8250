okay great so yeah this is to reiterate the autocomplete which is the first feature of search I wanted to share with you on the second feature I want to talk about is the entire relevancy aspect right because relevancy is a very very tough term and a problem to resolve. so what we did is before we started building out the platform we we went through a lot of stuff especially on how people search for products on any e-commerce site and a common trend came across and I would send you a white paper on this as well basically if you look at any kind of search query on any retail site it will kind of fall into one of these 12 buckets right. people would go onto an e-commerce site and probably search by a part number they might search by a model name they might search by an exact product type and I'd go and search by a theme like say a party shoes or a formal trouser or they might actually go and search by natural language if I'm naive when I don't know what to look for your site I'll probably just randomly go and say lights at $100 right. I mean people put them when they put any random stuff on Google they actually get some fairly relevant results and they expect every retail site to perform in the same way but it's it's a classic spoilt for choice problem right.,
