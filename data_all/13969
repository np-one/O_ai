got it perfect the next component is using this four-step technology what are the different types of queries that we've actually solved so we have seen up to 12 different types of queries that an e-commerce site could see now not all of them might be applicable to you but this is what we've seen across our 1200 customers or 1200 website as to what are the different types of query you can see and we've grouped them and written an algorithm to solve every single one of them now we don't solve it how 100% and I want to say this upfront because relevancy is something Google is also struggling with so I don't want to come in and say that we solve all queries at 100% but we move the needle very close to hundred percent.,
