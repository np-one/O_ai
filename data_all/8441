Parts warehouse they they primarily sell I would say vacuum cleaner and other home appliance parts online okay before we came in they used to have two different search boxes here for two different kind of visitors on their site. One who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the name of the model that they're looking parts for right we came in we said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box. So instead what we built for them is something like this the moment I start typing in this cell on the left hand side you see all the parts for the cell on the right hand side you see all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for the set rights very specific to parts warehouse let me show you another example say express dot com. For express as a brand for them what was important was the categories now the moment I start typing in jeans you'll see jeans for all the various different categories not just that when I browse through these the products on the left hand side actually start changing in real time right start showing the popular products for each each of these categories. Not just that when I was doing this demo yesterday or I would say not yesterday actually last week this red jeans wasn't there it was actually blue jeans that was coming up here but today this is red jeans this shows that in in last I would say 48 to 72 hours red jeans has become more popular on their site and that's what people are more buying or looking at and then that's where this comes in right. So this is highly personalized in in real time based on user behaviour the user intent on the site and on popularity that these results come up here is another example big basket I know this is not from your vertical but wanted to show you the breadth of the customization of the solution specific to your needs right and some of the elements might be important for you here.,
