So yes we have the ability to make content searches yes it is again considered as a SKU and we can obviously define that now here is an example if you're still seeing my screen tell you about their business the way they started their business was they have a huge library of articles on various different crystals right so people search about these crystals on Google and land up on their site mostly reading about them reading those articles so they have a huge library of these articles for these crystals and they wanted to make sure that that is also made searchable but still giving more priority to the products because products is what fetches then the the revenue at the end of the day. So here you see this example amethyst right these are all products these are all products but then here's something somewhere here yeah amethyst meaning and users this is not a product now if I was to click on amethyst meaning and uses these are all articles on top guides and resources and then these are the products. So we made the content also searchable for them so if you have content that you want to make searchable and want to make it an integral part of the of the oral search results we can do that and it could also be tuned with regards to how you are positioning it at what positions you want to put that content.,
