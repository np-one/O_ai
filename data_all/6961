thank you Kayl that and then if you want to just do a quick deep lavender how we actually do it this is essentially from a technology standpoint how we resolve it at our back end we do five things for every query start with semantic relevance which is the entire contextual awareness then we do something called the search results exclusion then we add the machine learning on top of it then we let then we look for any merchandising rule set and then we do any specific personalization or segmenting targeting that we need to do and this is something that we do for every single query and the reason we do this today is if you look at this query right I'm sorry it's a parallel context women white jeans most search systems are including so that they essentially use tf-idf where essentially they're looking for some kind of a text pattern match it could be in terms of anding or it could be a in terms of coughing or it could be in terms of minimum match in each of these three use cases what you would end up seeing is either two little products or way too many products or a whole group of irrelevant products which is not aware from a contextual sense because in the e-commerce context in especially in a apparel jeans probably is the most popular product and then it's women and probably then it's white right.,
