so I've just taken an example I know its in the apparel space but to give you some context right say there's a query like women's white jeans this is essentially how it'll show up because most systems use this rule called tf-idf which either gives your popularity score or a rarity score what we have done is we've added something called as usefulness score because as per TF/IDF if you look at the score it designs for women white and jeans it gives the maximum score to white then to women then to jeans.,
