Now even if you want to say run a clearance say May clearance right obviously I'll not find anything on the site because there's no words here called May clearance. All I have to do is go back here and merchandise a specific rule create a rule called May clearance merchandise no products will show. Convert this into a landing page the moment you convert this into a landing page all the products in your catalogue will be available and you can basically drag drop products pin products across. You can bring some products right on top pin them the way you want and then use the same filtering options use the same kind of promotions where you want to boost a specific thing.,
