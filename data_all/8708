From a platform perspective we can implement or we can integrate with any e-commerce platform being NetSuite or a homegrown Ecommerce platform as well and what sets us apart especially on NetSuite is that none of the other traditional site search vendors they can only do a hosted domain approach of implementation and I can I can dive deeper into that doing the implementation conversation but on high-level what what they are doing is they are creating a a sub domain on C name for your site so say instead of Wisteria dot com it would be searched dot wisteria dot com every every time someone is trying to search on the site they get redirected to searched dot wisteria dot com and and and they start serving the results. And that's the typical approach in its suite because of the limitations that NetSuite has by itself which is ideally not right for an e-commerce site because it negatively impacts your SEO. Whereas we have the ability to come in and do a NetSuite implementation through in page Ajax and then most of our customers are currently today on in pages Ajax which does not impact your SEO negatively at all. And I will show you what what what that also looks like the Ajax implementation.,
