So Faysal why can't we why can't you continue using elastic search for your category pages because that's more of a control system anyways but for search which requires a bit of semantics and and a little bit more technology use us and I understand that everything is searched today but essentially if you demarcated that way that the true search query results you use Unbxd and start there and see what it actually brings benefit to your team so you can actually see that ok this is actually working for us now you can put more control on it because you didn't go in and write elasticsearch right you obviously it's an open source you manipulated it so the same thing is available through Unbxd you can take the API you can define it how you want to but also freeze your team up from doing this merchandising pieces which is not something your team wants to do anyways right I mean it's not there's no challenge in that there's no challenging moving a product from fifth position to first position give it to the merchants use our dashboard and the more challenging pieces would be really trying to figure out to say what is actually happening with the data. So search can still be powered through us your category pages can still be powered through elasticsearch once you feel that ok this is this is a good happy medium you can then decide to say do we want to continue to invest in elasticsearch or we can use Unbxd to do the category pages also in the future if you want it to and and invest it through restful API and now you are actually doing more than what just elasticsearch is allowing you to write because create solving spell check by creating synonyms is not the most healthiest way to solve problems. And want to bring in a technology that really solves it so that's what we're trying to really say bring your happy medium try us out you're not saying that Replace everything on day one but at least see to bring in because ultimately the goal is no matter what you do is to increase conversions right that's what we'll be the bread and butter for everybody.,
