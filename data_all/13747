we have we have some limited a be testing capabilities that the developers have coded for us and I'm just I'm not that familiar with some of the Google Analytics a/b testing and and some of the limitations we might have with that we may actually be able to do more with that but I just I'm not that familiar with some of the some of the things and in attempts that we've made to use Google Analytics for the a/b testing I've kind of stopped me in the tracks because of the way that the testing has to be set up and I'm not real sure how to kind of get through that so I don't know if that's an opportunity or not if we could do some testing through analytics or not .,
