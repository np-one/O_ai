Okay yeah I think um there's a lot of information you guys provided I think we'll just need to take a second look and kind of derive out all the important information that we can present to both our director and a senior management and we'll just have to see if we can get this proposal approved.  So right now the balls on our court and we just need to see if this is something that we can acquire whether it be for q4 or starting on 2017 in q1 so um if we have any questions we'll definitely keep in touch with you guys this project we actually have another project kind of higher in priority so this will be the runner-up.,
