okay so let's just say I will go into one of those deals so this is a contact that isn't currently in the one stage so I have these are all the deals that are associated with the contact and I will go into one of those deals in the one stage where you know I have the one stage and I have a bunch of information associated with the one as well so it's pretty much you know corresponding to the business or the company itself as to what to do with the one stage so some companies might go ahead and create another pipeline and create a support process as well so they might be using freshdesk to follow up with the tickets and you know receive inquiries from the support portal and answer them and they might also have a support team who might work on the support pipeline as well so they might have a pipe follow-up one or a follow up 2 as well after the one.,
