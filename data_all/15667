Complete infrastructure on Amazon is on AWS we also use the Amazon CloudFront as our  CDN insuring also we have our disaster recovery we have as our systems as well so we have a concrete disaster recovery solution what's the worst case now time I think couple of years ago during the holiday season in December of we were new and there was a very high cliff we saw a downtime up to three minutes we have very high checkpoints the moment something goes down everyone's gets an alert on the system and so 2 to 3 minutes downtime is what we saw during the Thanksgiving period that was around I would say two and half three years I think three years from now this is yeah not the last one but the one before that but after that we haven't seen any any major downtime.,
