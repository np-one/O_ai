Okay cool again non products are something again that's that's very important to understand I look for this shipping policy on your site I look for returns on the site understanding what what those those would be for your site it gives me zero results page. There are various different ways you can handle non product queries you can create various different links but the idea is that unbox has the ability to even I would say make the non product query searchable at times we also make content searchable if you have any articles you have any any blogs or any other content materials that's available on the site we can also make that piece searchable.,
