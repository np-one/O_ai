So and what's really popular and trending will start to show up that up top if you have some history in terms of what you might have searched for if you before you start typing you move and show you recent searches. So the autocomplete this design is slightly different than what a desktop design would really look like next is from a UI perspective how do we guide and do category refinements within search this is some sort of a UI component. Like I search for shoes I now we have shoes in men's women's boy's girl's how do I show those specific blocks but also show products so that I am not forcing the customer down a particular path if they don't want to go down that path. Filters again the whole dynamic filter aspect of it completely translates to mobile and we have a mobile specific experience also I mean this is just an example it it can easily look like what your mobile experience looks like. It's just that we enable multi-select with an apply button to optimize for a mobile experience next is zero results page so today you might have a zero results page. And let's say I'll just force that so today what happens is I don't get any search results obviously and but you do show me some recently viewed products right which is fantastic what we believe that you do want to do two things.,
