Similarly stemming battery versus batteries you see the experience is totally different right the intent of the customer does not change whether they type battery or the type batteries right singular plural. I saw one of the product on your site fuel tubing versus fuel tube you call it as fuel tubing as a customer I might come and call it as fuel tube again the intent of the customer is not changing. But the experience is different the search results are not relevant so again all of these words typically the singular plural words like game gaming center central.,
