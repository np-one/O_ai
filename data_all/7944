So you know and this again I know we're running short of time one thing I also want to show you is despite all the analytics we also have this dashboard I showed you the merchandising section of the dashboard but we also made a fairly comprehensive dashboard for all our products for search for your product recommendations and for your category navigation where you A get a quick executive summary of the entire revenues through that specific channel it could be through search or through category pages where you get high level metrics you essentially can manage your different domains or production site staging site from a single console and you also have access to a fairly comprehensive reporting to some final elements of search and category pages which you might not find on an Omniture or a Google Analytics.,
