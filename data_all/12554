and we're talking filters we are talking facets and we are also talking about implementing a spell check algorithm to take like you know ensure that in case someone typed in something wrong I'm boss can actually go ahead and start showing in the results for the right query so implementing all this could be a bit cumbersome if you get your team to do because there'll be a lot of concentration required from our end to get this up and running at your end so I think it's best that we actually get it done at the Unboxd in itself and apart from this because the autosuggest the type-ahead that you'll see when you go to any of the sites when you start typing in the search box so this is something pretty simple pretty straightforward we'll be showing you a few of the design layouts that we do and it's just going to be a Java Script which needs to be put in all the pages and you know getting the search up and running over there so any questions on this aren't otherwise I can just quickly run you through a few things within the autosuggest as well.,
