Yeah yeah I agree that's when is filter by size but say for dresses maybe that is another attribute on the product which is material I'm just just making the stuff but maybe you have another attribute there which is important for dresses which could be material or which could be the fit type so what if you were to add those filters or to ensure that for your search results and purchase processes the start seeing filters which are very specific to dresses versus say for shoes they start seeing filters which are very specific to shoes and you can also have set up filters now here I know that you had skirts with like.,
