So we generally put everything as a package so because it's more convenient to have a contract executed overall because in case you see the right results and you want to continue you don't have to do renegotiation of the contract at the end of three months We essentially put everything into place now may be clearly call out the first 90 days as an evaluation period but basically you can exit at any time without any notice to Unbxd and we will have a small fee associated for the POC phase as well which is generally fifty percent of whatever is the actual monthly fee Say if your monthly fee for the site that we had discussed about was three thousand dollars you will probably only pay half of that amount once you fully go live that is after your test period and once we actually start serving live traffic on Unbxd dot com And then whenever you choose to go ahead with the contract either before the end of 90s or at the 90th day is only when the actual monthly fees would be applicable,
