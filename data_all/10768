So the debate is some people some retailers say that the customer has already made up his mind he wants to buy this bag right so let him just go and check out I don't want to divert his attention whereas some of the others come in and say that he's yet not checked out right so I would still not want to lose the opportunity of showing him some more bags if he's yet not sure of buying this he might want to go any <bag for> so there is we meet a lot of retailers and there is always a debate about that so we leave it up to them what you feel is right for the business you could do that.,
