okay so uh there are as Mona was saying two three ways of doing this implementation maybe we'll get to that later but let me just talk about some of the initial things that you'd need you know to figure out some of the other elements before we start the implementation so the first thing I guess the most important piece would be how do we go about carrying a product catalogue from you is there a standardized product catalog file that we can already use or can there be an API that can be exposed to us or should be we be pulling this data directly from some database at your end so I just wanted to understand how you do this currently and are you sharing this data with some of the other third parties is that something that we could also use on the unboxd end .,
