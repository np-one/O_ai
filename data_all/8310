hey guys I just wanted to jump in here just kind of reiterate Michael that the other benefit from our point of views from Viking coders point of views so you'll have Unbxd and they'll help on that end but we will also always be here so you'll always have a second point of contact and you know we've been doing integrations with them for a while now so we're well versed in it so for an example something goes on Saturday you need help you want to figure something out you know Viking coders will always be a second point of contact that will always be accessible as well so. I'm just you know I I appreciate that man you know the things that are I mean there's there's there's so much here I would love absolutely love to be able to drive my search results faster than search suggestions product page category page and put everything together so that it is a seamless experience with you know up-selling and cross-selling and suggestions. but I I just don't I mean I don't know I don't know anything about this stuff you know on the other than what I've been doing with search spring for the past four or five years and I on the flip side of that unless I you know unless the results were I don't want to say overwhelming.,
