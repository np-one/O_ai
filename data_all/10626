Yeah so it'll actually comprised of both the phases David so one we once we set up everything we will put it on your QA you can test it on your QA for about a week's time run multiple test cases and once your test cases are all satisfied then it can actually take it live and see it on the live site as well So you can do both because if you have to since you're also looking at the entire business value proposition right I think having it run on the live site also and monitoring whether this is actually resulting in increasing conversion might make even more sense to you so that is why we thought of this thing,
