is a parts company and for them the use case was people either come in search by a part number or by model name like either people know exactly what they want or they don't know what they want so they actually had to search boxes before they came to us that kind of amplified the problem on relevancy and the results got really solved so there were two things with it for it so one was we built them apart finder from a browser experience so that they can find any part in three clicks and from search we had a unified search experience where if I say pick up this name the cell I start searching for the cell so on one side you see parts the other side you see model names and then you have the third box which essentially shows all the top searches starting with the ISS right and then if you click on anything and go into a PDP page versus an apparel space like Express right that high fashion they want segmentation because people's buying behaviour changes even on the city that they're actually coming from today if I go and look for something like jeans the way they want is to give an experience to a customer even going into a retail store of Express where first you will go into an AI then you will go into a category and then you'll go into a product right similar on online they wanted a similar experience so jeans is it for women am i buying it for myself what am i buying it for my spouse or am i looking at four genes in a specific style and then we introduced a segmentation block where depending on the location that the user was coming in from what is the most popular at locations for New York City probably Gray's most popular show the segmentation block for New York City which actually drill this down to us of course we can differentiate Upper Manhattan versus Bronx vs Harlem versus New Jersey which might be relevant for you in a grocery use case where things or products might change project code and then we saw the popular product and vision as you keep holding around the images actually change so from a apparel fashion landscape but actually make sense versus what are you going .,
