The popular products might change based on the Geo-location depending on where the customers are coming from a particular boot might be more popular in New York versus in California so we understand the Geo-location of every visitor on the site and start showing popular products based on their location right and this is what improves the prob or I would say increases the probability of the end-user buying a particular product on the site and that's where we are confident of also you know showing that minimum ten percent increase right within the first 60 to 90 days of going live on any e-commerce site. So some of the examples that I looked at on the site so here here are a few very you know interesting used cases that I want to walk you through I searched for canon 70-2000 mm right on Google BH photo video is on top on Google for this particular query I click on the link I get the right product here right this is this is exactly the product you would want to show to your customer but when I try and search for the same thing on your site what I'm getting are some some sort of I would say the covers or skins for lenses and not the lenses by themselves right so not the not the right experience of not the right set of product that the customer might be looking at. Same thing I look for say DSLR external video recorder again when I do this on Google BH photo video is on top I click on it the right products that that I might be interested in but the moment I start searching for the same thing on the site the experience is totally different a lot of these products are also non relevant then Leica m9 then I look for Leica m9 start showing me some of the parts for Leica m9 and not Leica m9 by itself but when I navigate on the site you surely have the Leica m9 Leica m cameras out there price sort one of the feature that lots of sites have and kind of tent to I would say lose importance in terms of how it is being optimized on the site today and primarily because of the relevancy not being right on the site.,
