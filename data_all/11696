Where a customer has bought a product in his previous transaction he's returned and we tracked user behavior for six months we can also change it to one year or three month the way your requirement is for them the requirement is for six months. So depending on what he had bought in the previous transaction so the moment he lands in the site this is the first thing he sees he sees something this name can be changed for them since it's bracelets they said it's hand-picked just for you. And you show him specific set of bracelets that he could probably he or she could only be interested right from the word go right.
