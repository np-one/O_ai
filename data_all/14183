well I mean right now probably the two big ones are ease of implementation and cost so I mean as I said we're we weren't necessarily looking I mean I can see that your product is a good one in that it performs well I think that's one that we I can't remember exactly I've looked at a bunch of these now so it's kind of a blurry you know but I do remember looking at yours and thinking this you know this looks really good even though I had never heard of it before so that's why I contacted you so but the thing is is that at the same time you know we're also saying we're just we're not big enough to be able to pay a lot of money for search and we're also or to pay a lot of money for implementation you know we have a very small staff but we do everything ourselves so we you know we don't have a big crew of tech people and you know so further we don't really have a budget to hire consultants to implement so so that's those are our two big criteria you know I mean and I think obviously we wanted to work well but we're not we're not expecting you know for that kind of a for the limitations we have to have something that's you know the greatest search in the world. we need something totally that you're basically does you know I mean I think that you know it's a we've been using Google Site Search in it you know it's okay it's not great but it's okay you know and but it's also just pause very much so it is sudden demand much of us you know if we had a better one and it gave us better sales and yeah we would like that you know and if it was you know possible to do that within a you know budget that we could you know afford initially and then you know if it what you know as the process grew and as I mean we're we're also as you know as I said we're in the process of changing over the whole design all the templates to <> it all everything has to kind of be working with that process as well so there's a lot going on all at once here which which I guess probably complicates matters time.,
