So well most of our what we do and most of our competitors do is create their own taxonomy and then what we've done in the last couple of year is to look at the keywords the customer search and to start building the taxonomy around the keywords so whether they put in indicators blue to mobile that the most relevant terms are are matched so we start activating things like type-ahead what we're doing now is beginning to match in a couple of different ways so we're taking you know neon indicators is actually a great example because you're right you can find it a number of ways and there's there's probably two things we need to do one is a better grouping of you know neon indicators you correctly pointed out or in lighting products and they're probably in a couple other categories we need to reduce those number of categories and then give the customer an abbreviated list so that whether they search for indicators neon indicators LCD indicators that you know it aligns with keywords that they most frequently use and the choices are display where we're going below that you'll probably get to and you started discuss is really the attribution which both is an internal and external search so we are looking at the long tail of how they search and you're right 125 volts is the survival do not happen first attribute so when Google searches we're going to change our URL structure so that whether it's the category and attribute or a brand that we can differentiate it and this will help  further kind of slice up that the different functions that'll make it the site easier to svroll and easier to search for different values so yeah I think we're we're saying the same things but it's just a long path of how to get that.,
