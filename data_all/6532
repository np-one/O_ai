Got it so there's two parts to this question Barrien I think that where you're coming from is absolutely these are the holy grail of where everybody wants to right nobody wants to do the manual work to figure out and if you could find this holy grail of algorithm that always keeps my conversions up but also somehow make sure that you know optimising my inventory also that would be the best of the brief you would not believe Amazon today with best of the engineers that they have spends almost 15 million dollars in just product discovery on their site for technology with people with merchants with everything else that they have available they are still sitting there and merchandising their product and here's the reason why the biggest reason for this is there is no ability to sort of predict to that degree what an individual customer is going to like even when you have historical derive I mean as you showed you the slide where I know that about these jeans I know this is the price range they're looking to buy in but how would we know that that particular customer is not going to spend a lot more money on shoes.,
