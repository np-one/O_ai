Yes exactly and the challenge is someone is to sit and see this right and And we and we are so swamped with some of the other projects some of the other priorities that that we don't realize that we might be losing customers right the end up spending a lot in marketing in increasing the traffic but are we converting them and and we come in and say with your current marketing spend with no additional marketing spend with your current traffic that you bring onto the side we will take your revenues up by say 10% other conversion rates up by 10% right. And and that's where you will be able to optimize all your marketing spend by increasing the conversions right because there is a there is there is a limit to how much you can you can spend in terms of marketing to bring more traffic right and if you are not converting the traffic it actually doesn't make sense to add that any more traffic on the other site and then and that's that's the most important. Here are some more examples and I looked at aluminum knob these are some of them are not even knobs they're probably aluminum products somewhere in the product description it would say aluminium and that just pulls out right the system today is not able to understand that knob is actually a product and aluminum is the material for that particular product and you'll notice that on Express how we have saw that full sleeve office ware for women I would say black v-neck for women right and the system is able to automatically understand that women is the gender a v-neck is the style black is the color. And that's what is looking for we understand the intent of the customer here is another example from IB supply I I notice that you do not have a sorting option on the site times you would want to give the customer the ability to sort products right especially when when a search results page returns say 100 products if I'm looking for grommets and you have hundreds of grommets and now I want to look for the cheapest grommet or the cheapest metal grommet you would you would want the customer to be able to filter that sort that especially through the price option. It would be low to high or high to low that is another functionality that you can add on your site.,
