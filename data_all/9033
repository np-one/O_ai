All right thank you so hopefully you guys can see my screen yeah okay perfect so just like a Jestin Sharath explained Gary and SSB the plant the idea behind when you talk about site search is not just One aspect of site search there are two different components and we want to surf it open up opportunity and a parody to understand that this is the opportunity be both talking about and what is it that you want to come in and help with so and it's good to know that you know large percentage of our cuts of your customers are using Site Search and in grocery me that is typically true what we've seen is in grocery with other customers that have bee work with the basket size is roughly 30 to 40 products maybe in some cases 45 as well. So customers are buying a lot of products in a single transaction which is why they want to just get in and get out so they want to quickly do the shopping they don't have the time to do five clicks for every single product whereas they would take 200 clicks so let's get into the specifics of the relevancy and you know we obviously wanted to start showing in terms of what is it that we need by relevancy so starting with the product type query at least we basically we're searching for butter and I'm sure you probably won't run into this problem also you're searching for apples space juice they're looking for apple juice right but it'll start showing apples looking for blueberry something ice cream or blueberry yogurt it will start showing blueberry. So this is what the idea behind relevancy is that I'm looking for a particular product and I'm not necessarily seeing that specific product. However when I go through the navigation so here I search for butter and I get a lot of the vegetable oil and not the butter but when I go through the navigation I actually do see butter. Same I want to look at fresh vegetable versus there's a complete category called fresh vegetable and this is where it takes us to go to produce if I then wanted to get gluten-free bread you can see that from a lot of perspectives two sets of problems one you are obviously not seeing with gluten-free bread but you're also seeing sold out items online first now that a problem also cannot you want to show out of stock products up top.,
