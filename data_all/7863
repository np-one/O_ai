But search is what we started with and we believe enterprise search is probably the most difficult problem to solve A because there is a lot more complexity and you've very little control on how an individual might look for the same product in in very very different ways so it's very difficult to build and manage it manually hence we actually ended up building an AI platform and today the AI platform has automated most of the manual functions that would happen while you manage any enterprise search functionality right starting with things like your spell checks your synonym detection different variances of relevancy including natural language which is probably one thing that we're really really good at we've essentially tried automating most of the experiences which was probably a challenge till now Plus at the same time we've built this merchandising tool because your merchants know your business better than anybody else so we also wanted to give them all the flexibility to also run campaigns as well so that's the whole gamut we've built.,
