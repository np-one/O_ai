so if I start your implementation now the first day I started I implement a tracking algorithm and we start collecting data on you user like for somebody like Newegg just to give you an example. they have close to 100 million products like truckloads of traffic the amount of data transfer that happens between our devices just as a learning tool is roughly about 20 gigs a day that's the amount of data that gets passed on to our big data system with the learnings you have had in one single day right. and these learnings is helpful for us so that we can show where to show a widget for a top-rated product what to showing that widget and what to show in that widget can also encompass off where the user is actually coming from right the second widget we built as a theme was wisdom of your crowd where we said let's let's use collaborative behavior. because this will help us build out widgets which is like a cross sell widget or an up-sell widget because here we look at the buying pattern of the user on the site okay if a user has bought product X what else he is likely to buy with product X does he buy Y does he buy A does he buy E does he buy F right.,
