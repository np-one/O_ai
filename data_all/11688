So then when we started figuring out these things so what we looked at was on any retail site so one theme that is very important to capture user metrics is popularity right so when we say popularity what Unbxd does is we go back up to six months of user data that we collect it would be a new user or it could be a repeat user. And then popularity theme we primarily start packing is the day we start doing our implementation we enable the tracking on your site and what we start tracking is a what is the product being bought on the site what categories of product are being bought what are the locations that these <P> products are being bought so say Musil drops is being bought from people in Midwest versus flu shorts in LA and so those informations starts getting tracked. And based on the specific popularity associated either with the category or with a product or from a location these popularity theme starts getting populated for your top ranked products and we also determine as to where they should appear on the site as well right so that's the first theme we started building an algorithm for our back end. The second theme was something called as wisdom of the crowd so here what we did was we looked at collaborative behaviour A we look at the entire popular trend on the site as to what product is hot and what is not selling really well. And second we also started looking at what the users are specifically buying from a specific location to start determining what could be the right product to upsell to a specific user and what is the right product to cross-sell. Like this is where our user groupings where ten people who bought say flu shots also bought three of them also what nasal drops right ten of them who bought say a band-aid also bought cotton rolls right.,
