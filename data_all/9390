Okay alright awesome next is the a user experience base so this is more a combination of Technology and user experience what we we're trying to do here I'm searching for say mobile and mobile could mean a lot of things that could mean smart phones headphones cases covers etc. In this customer's case what we wanted to do was guide a customer because it's it's not a race to show products to a customer right it's a race to guide the customer to the right set of products the faster you do that the better that funnel for transaction and conversions would look like. So when you say customer searches for mobile and I think you guys do that too and I don't know whether you guys do that manually or is it dynamic and if it has any machine learning to it but I at least wanted to demonstrate this to you. So I search for mobile and I know that mobile could mean smart phones headphones etc the technology will find these subcategories and show them in the order of popularity. We know that smart phones are most popular and then headphones that's how that's the order it will start to show up in and if mobile screens start to become more popular over time it will start automatically percolate up top as well. Another example we have it slightly different UI is here I search for Alexander Wang and Alexander Wang makes dresses tote bags etc I want to make sure and maybe I will we start this UI.,
