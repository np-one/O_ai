so we can basically mimic the response of InBecka or a solar so that your application will technically not know from where it's coming from so you can do all the logic of if you have four specific city you have a specific pricing which probably she has even if you have some complex logic on your application and if you're worried as to how a new system will integrate with it we can technically mimic the entire response that you're a solar as InBecka is doing today just so that you could you don't have to do too much of work at your end so you could still see how the system could work in the environment that you have and and see how we can take it up from that.,
