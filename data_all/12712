okay okay and maybe I ought to show you one more thing I think you already must be having a few sort options alright so so if here if you just see this so by default we can also provide some specific sort options now it could be based on relevancy or it could be based on price or it could be based on some custom attributes based on your product catalogue so and this is something you should definitely be adding but I just want to understand which would be some of these custom fields that you would want us to add this feature so as an example it could be relevance which is something we give by default it could be price  it could be new arrivals and any other field custom field that you like.,
