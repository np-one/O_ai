I think this is what we do right so I think if you look at the whole spectrum given the nature of the space right you need to have a very very strong focus on the whole ideation and the whole creation thought process right because it's not it's not run-of-the-mill kind of what we're trying to do is I'm trying to think new is trying to come up with new use cases is trying to come up with advance analytic scenarios for our customer right that's where the magic comes to play and this is where lot of collaboration and I think joint thinking and ideation happens with a customer where we kind of take an idea put some thoughts around it fail fast learn fast and kind of come up with something that is a very tangible use case that can impact your business right.,
