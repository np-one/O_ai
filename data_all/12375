and let me see how this works for you currently so once a filter is selected what we do is we also add over here on the top what are the filters which have been selected and we provide a way for the user to directly clear all the viewers or you know clear any individual filter directly from one you know somewhere on top over here so those are the facets tags that's something we can provide to you by default at least in those pages you <> so.,
