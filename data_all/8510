One is the high level executive reporting or top search queries top products added to cart top zero results queries on top clicked products right these are some of the high level executive reporting and this is this is not say top 200 queries or two to top 200 products but you can see all the data available based on particular time frame right then you can define the time could be one month one week one quarter one year and that you want to look the data for. Then the next is a detailed query level reporting right each and every query on your site with the metrics with regards to what their hits are CDRs conversions Add to Cart and orders now if I look at this particular query gives me a trendline a sales trendline how this query has been performing and what are the products associated with this query which are converting or not converting. On the flip side we give you each and every product level reporting right every product listed on the site gives your product views added to add to carts if I click on this particular product it now shows me a sales trend line for this particular product and what are the queries that this product is associated. Any any questions on reporting.,
