we would you just need to cover a certain threshold of traffic and I believe that that amount of traffic should be covered within a couple of days so but let me double-check with my team well I'll definitely let them know that surgical data is available but based on the traffic that you guys have if if you collect all this data going forward do we need to create work because I don't want to create work for your team either I know you already have the data and you might have the process ready to go but I just want to not necessarily get into something where just by deploying analytics and just by waiting for two days we can get what we need that should be good enough for us.,
