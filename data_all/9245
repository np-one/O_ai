Right right hand side I have the snapshot of that that page I click on software I get various different classifications various different software's that I could be interested in and I you also have classification by brand when I search for software the experience is not same that two ways to handle it one is obviously you can always take the users someone looking for something exactly on your category page you can take them to the category page or here is an example . On an electronic side say I was looking for mobile I'm not my intent is not yet clear and I'm looking for mobile mobile headphones cases and covers we the technology that can identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity. Not just that but you also immediately starts showing products for the most popular category that being mobiles here you immediately start showing Mobile's. But then the customer can still choose between mobile headphones cases headsets right and not only that but say if mobile cases and covers was more popular than headphones then cases and covers would come on position 2 and headphones go on position 3. Same thing for outnet we built this as a demo if I was to look for Alexander Wang who's a designer and in your case it could be a brand light the intent is not clear Alexander Wang makes a lot of different products could be todes shoulder bags shoes we can start showing these products by Alexander Wang neatly bucketed into each category on a single page I'm giving the customer and ability to browse through these products horizontally or vertically. Facets of filters it's it's good to see that you have various different facets on the field on the site today on your I would say search results  page but one of the things that I notice well they're pretty static right in nature irrespective of what I'm searching for printers or ID cards I get a category on top subcategory then maybe printing have the capability printing technology right lamination capable.,
