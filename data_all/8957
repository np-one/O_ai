I'm sorry I had on mute no I I don't have any questions I guess the big question is you know once we determine what platform that we're moving to is if you can't integrate with that and like you said most of the more popular once you can but I'm not sure one of the more popular ones. So I would have to look into that I'm she I saw a demo of one that had a great search function built into it but it would be interesting to see if it does what your your technology does so I'm not sure until I get there and dive into it.,
