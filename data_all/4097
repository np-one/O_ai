Same thing I look for sneaker versus sneakers singular and plural the set of results were totally different this time they were sneakers but very different results then I made a spelling mistake helmets with wherein I interchanged L and M right typical when when people start typing in fast or they are coming from smaller screens like say mobile phone tablet and they tend to make these mistakes with this for helmets you have over 647 products on on the website but when I when I misspell it it does identify it starts showing you some hel helmets but just four helmets and and not all.,
