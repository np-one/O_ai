This one I can okay I can do that I can send it especially the deck that I presented to you now and the another Doc's mean that I would want to actually share with you is more about the the the implementation we should also give you an high level understanding in terms of the implementation so this is the document if I still see my screen right there three is to to search implementation hosted such we still do this hosted such but we do not recommend this right most of the traditional search vendors do or hosted and hence we have this here but this negatively impacts your search the only reason people do this is when they don't have enough IT resources internally or say companies don't want to look into it right so come please come in and say you picture. But then the most recommended is Ajax even some of the larger customers like Express are still on Ajax they have yet not gone on to a a API implementation so most of our customers are currently on an AJAX implementation another third way is the restful api that we can do so this has a kind of high-level overview in terms of how we can do the the implementation for each of these okay I'll also share doc.,
