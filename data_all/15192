So I would say that with hosted versus in page Ajax the the expense really doesn't change much it will pretty much remember same except the API based which is a little more expensive and not very expensive I would say.  The difference would be hardly forty to fifty percent in terms of the implementation or the set of API but with hosted and in page Ajax both will remain same we would still recommend an in page Ajax way of integrations so that you have the control you own the URL it does not impact your SEO and other marketing credibility basically right.,
