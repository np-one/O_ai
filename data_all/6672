Correct so the way we did this I am assuming this is Connor because I'm starting to make the sound voices tied to the names so I'll give you a a apparel example just in parallel so let's see if I go to express we've not turned this on for express what I wanted to give you a parallel just to simplify the answer let's say I started to navigate on men's products okay and then if I search for the tops or t-shirts or shirts I want to make sure that I actually show men's shirts right now there's an assumption an inherent assumption that because I navigated through men's category I might be a male and I want to show men's shirt what we do is we don't blanket these search results with men's shirts because we may be wrong it's possible that a woman came in was searching for men's products for her husband for her boyfriend whatever and now wants to buy something for herself and she just happened to search something so we we do take that into consideration to say that the experience in real time was on men's products so we show a little bit more men's products we but we also mix in women's products in there now let's say I was looking at 10 men's products instead of just one that's a very strong signal that I'm really interested in men's products in that instance if I now search for shirts or tops or t-shirts we will actually show a lot more men's product than women's products so it's a it's a progressive scale depending on how much attribution or or the activity that the customer has done can strongly suggest one direction one particular type of customer versus the other because you don't you know you don't want to assume and be wrong because I might look at one dog product and if we assume that you are dog customer and we show all dog products and no cat products and certainly I might be on the side to give it as a gift to somebody possibly you know I mean I know dog lovers and cat lovers can't mingle but let's assume they can and so we try to mix it up a little we don't try to do all guns blazing but if I saw ten dog products I might show a lot more dog products than cat products versus if I just shopped one dog product.,
