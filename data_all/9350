We don't necessarily just give you the solution we understand your business and how customers interact with your business and we try to customize the solution for your business we have tremendous amount of infrastructure scale like I said we serve almost 1 point 5 billion interactions but every single interaction is backed by a sub 300 millisecond SLA. And we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery because we know we have a very differentiated product so let me get into what is it that we were able to find in few instances. And I want to get the conversation so started so you guys can tell me where the challenges might be so excuse me the most the biggest challenge that I first found obviously is one of our most mature products is with site search. So let's say if I started to search for say accent chair or accent table okay what I found is if you can see here the autosuggest. Which is the or you might call it auto complete auto fill type ahead I don't know how many different ways we could just come back every year somebody else comes up with a new way to call it so we call it Auto suggest and but or the type-ahead. And the that is the first interaction a customer has with your website site search experience right and you can see here I starting to search for even let's say your accent chair or table.,
