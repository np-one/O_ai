So the approach that we've tried to do is for the single word terms which take up the majority of them the results are fairly to the challenge for us and what we're currently working on would be these sorts of multiple word terms were a customers looking for an indicator what an indicator could be something which is either in a piece of equipment it could be on a printed circuit board it could be you know an industrial warning light I mean there's there are a bunch of different ways but someone could use the same thing so you end up having to display a few categories to help them navigate the search and one then one of the things that you will see on our website in an next couple of months will be some refinement so you search for neon indicators and here are some potential categories that you want to choose from.,
