let me do this so just and I'll share this report with you with some of my findings but one of the things I wanted to do is actually take you to some websites and actually show you what we've tried doing and how you fight addressing some of the issues and I'll take you through some three four different examples just to give you some perspective of how we have solved it in each vertical starting with autosuggestion itself like if it's a fashion retailer the way we have tried doing this actually adding a lot more Geo segments to what the user could be looking for if I want to go and look for sale something like jeans we want to guide the customer where you're looking for jeans for women jeans for men is it jeans of a specific style and then also introduce a colour segment where depending on the location that the user is coming in from actually show them jeans of a specific colour as well.,
