okay so on the home page we generally go with recently viewed and the top sentence now obviously in the beginning we will not have any top set of data coming in from your end but going through your geo data we know what our top four or five top-selling products and as on how we go live but the next couple of days if we actually start throwing in the top sellers based on the real-time analytics data that unbox captures so these are the two that go on to the homepage and you can go for well more like this on the product description pages because this lets do you know show some of the other similar items from the specific categories and subcategories that people may want to buy so this is this goes on your PDP and later on once we have enough data we can pick up one of these two widgets on the product description pages as well we've also viewed all the bottles you bought which takes into account some of the other similar users with very similar click history and buying history animation that we try and recommend products that those are the users have been buying on the side so these can all be done in a phase two and then you have the recommended for you now this is personalized for every user I would suggest you to put this on the zero result page you know whenever someone is coming onto the side and for some reason they are not able to find any results for a search query instead of redirecting them to a blank page we actually take them to a page where they can actually see these recommendations were personalised for them vision what they have been clicking on and in case it's a new user we try and show those products which are trending on your site at any one point so so these are the ones I would suggest starting off with and in due course we can then go ahead and add the cart recommendations and a view also of viewed or a bought also bought on the product of description pages.,
