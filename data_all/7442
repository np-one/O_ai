so what we did was we kind of added another layer on top of the tf-idf algorithm which is called a relevancy gain which essentially let me let me go it's that's cranials will essentially adds another weight-age or assigned to certain weighted to each of that product so if you see typically on a search vendor using a tf-idf algorithm the highest weight-age is for womens then is for white and then it's with jeans and we know that you know somebody looking for women's white jeans the first thing is you want to show the relevant product which is the jeans so we assign the second weighted to it where we assign highest rated genes so that ways we exclude all of the non relevant products which are women's in white and so once we've got the product jeans we also understand that the attributes of the consumer is looking for is women's in white and and we were able to you know assign appropriate adjust to it and enter relevant results so that's essentially have we solved for relevancy and like most other search vendors .,
