Alright awesome well thank you again I I could just sent a mail Allen just mentioned given us the opportunity here for presenting our solutions so here's a quick rundown of what our agenda looks like today so we'll share maybe 60 seconds tell you a little bit more about us we'll then dive straight into the elements of site search and how we see site search and how we break it down into five different components we'll share a little bit of the analysis that we did on your site just to establish that clarity of what is the opportunity that you really want to talk about and why Unbxd and what is our approach okay Allen is there a particular piece that you wanted to cover or you want me to continue. Yeah I just wanted to cover some of the things that Connor and I spoke about and just kind of drive just to make sure that we're on the same page so Connor when we last spoke about how things are today in terms of your implementation you have so and how about working for you guys and what you're looking to really solve is around the zero results also being able to have the ability to have analytics that are going to drive the ability to do pivots and understand where the data is coming from in terms of zero result or which queries are working which queries are not working and be able to make changes appropriately also in terms of merchandising being able to have a tool that allows you through a UI to make pinning and slotting and kind of changing things around at your discretion based on you and your partnerships with different brands and right now that's not something that you guys are able to do don't have any recommendations or anything like that really what you're really trying to do at the end of the day is trying to improve that user experience and guide them through the buying cycle so they know which products you guys have as well as exposing them to other products that you might not have and that's through having a better spelling system a stemming system that allows those capabilities to drive that better user experience and that's kind of a high level of what we covered in what I've gathered for the team is there anything that I missed or is that I'm pretty accurate in terms of what we spoke now.,
