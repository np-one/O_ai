yeah I know we've kind of not gone through merchandising or any of those sections so what we can do this next steps go through what I will do is then send you this document I had prepared and also send you an implementation approach document you can review that so next call we could answer any questions on implementation we can take you through our merchandising dashboard I think that's a huge feature that we offer as to how well you can actually merchandise at our solution and then before that next call if there's an NDA we have to sign I'm happy to do that and then if you can share some of the metrics probably we can also have a quick call on how the pricing structure might work because I want to make sure it makes sense for you guys and then we can discuss like steps and look at you the POC sometime this quater.,
