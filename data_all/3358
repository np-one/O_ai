so we hired 425 focus group participants we gave them the site and we gave them three tasks we didn't tell them how to perform those tasks but they then judge themselves and then we measured what they did based on that now the measurement was either positive or negative if it was negative we've distributed into three levels severe moderate or mild and negative been it was it's some sort of an interruption right so severe was a enough to disrupt the flow and mild was it was an annoyance but they could still proceed through that annoyance and here's the five stages that we analyzed the customer on so discovery stage selection comparison check out and return stage now the caveat here is it will it says checkout if we are not saying the how long it takes for somebody to check out it is still in the context of product discovery because that is the only place where we have expertise even if we thought that it took a long time for somebody to checkout me couldn't tell me why or what alright what is it that you're gonna do about it but what we have talked about is if somebody is checking out can they discover the right set of products at that time based on what your business requirements are and then the return stage is not returning products for the customer coming back to the site does that work for you does that make sense.,
