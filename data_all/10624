Okay great so here's the approach we were thinking of taking so we have proposed a 90 days evaluation period as well right so we were thinking you have two websites we will start integrating with the first website we go live with website one for about two weeks see the initial results If you're seeing the right trends then we start integration website two and then you roughly on an average our implementation cycles will be between three and four weeks once we get the first set first site live if there is not this check in site is not way too different from the first site probably the integration can be done even in two two half weeks as well So the way we were thinking is so the first four weeks we go live with site one then you test it for two weeks see the results then we start integrating site two between six to seven weeks with where both your sites are live on Unbxd platform and you can start monitoring all the conversion rates and all the other business metrics that you would want to look at and finally at the end of 90 days you can essentially take a call whether from a overall business perspective is this making sense to you or it's not making sense to you,
