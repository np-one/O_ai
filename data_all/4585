so to start the catalogue will only be a couple hundred SKUs i within 12 within 12 to 24 months it may only be 5000 SKUs so it's gonna be a slow ramp up for us as we add products and you know we we may only do one order a week within the first six to twelve months so it's gonna be very very limited and I don't mind paying more as the volume is there but I need something that's affordable to get in the door when we have a low SKU counts to then improve the value for later on so how do we get it down to the thousand dollars .,
