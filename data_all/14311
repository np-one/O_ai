right this is much easier because you don't have to put any load on your development team we are building all the concepts on our end we take your inputs on how the auto suggest template should look like the only three things we need from you is the catalogue feed in any format you have we request you to install our analytics on day 1 and then you give us a page with a head there in the filter footer and impede of time so that's the only three things we need so this is much faster since the work is done by our team it's more predictable we can take things live in like a three week window the other approaches you want to do an API and open integration so we'll give you all the api's so your team would have to your development team needs to get involved on how do you actually call out these api is for all the calls that you have to make so that generally we've seen takes between four and five weeks because there is back-and-forth involved and hence it takes a little more time but we generally see nothing goes beyond six weeks including probably giving it a week for testing also so six weeks should be the maximum time to integrate.,
