sure no problem let me you know get you that piece of information because typically what I do is like I said post this call I can also subs send you certain solution articles summarizing on these couple of things that we discussed today so that you know you can refer to them to go up with the set up and alternatively what we could also do is something maybe when you had when you think you've had enough time to play around with the system we can you can also go out and shoot us an email where we can maybe go ahead and schedule a setup call which could be maybe again for an odd time where I we can discuss your specific workflows and I can you know help you set up your system and have it up and running in no time.,
