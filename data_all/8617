Perfect so if I were to do this And clearly it finds the perfect product right here one another idea that we've tried and this is something comes from the grocery world and I'll give you the context as to how we sort of come across came across this in grocery and I don't know if this is the same behavior in your world also or not but in B2B we've seen typically the same behavior will see that customers come in and buy a lot of products in a single transaction <> or some that I might be hosting this weekend I need to buy something normally that I don't buy so we also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands even though it does not contain bread and I remind you and categories okay and sorry just clicked on something and this we believe has turned out to be a much more richer experience and by the way is something like a merchandising messaging there might be important something that you guys are trying to get rid of inventory or just want to get people to know of a particular brand new product you also have that messaging available right here and I thought that something similar if I were to even obviously if I know exactly what I want to buy and I've bought this from you before I will come in and type in that same number you know why do I have to click here go to that results page find it maybe I need to find the quantity and stuff like that maybe there's that experience that I need to go to change that we can bring all of those different elements into the autocomplete also so the one also another way Chris to look at it is that the autocomplete is not just a necessarily narrow down of how the customer is behaving yes it is if I am typing indicators you do want to make sure and get them to an indicator category quickly but also when I'm typing for a very specific set of product set is it possible for me to start showing that product and be able to order right there from the auto complete rather than having to go through the experience of the PDP and then come here change the quantity and a add to cart all set. And all of this information we can certainly we can come up with some certain UI elements that can give you the same experience right there in the auto complete because the because and you know I mean if I just start to type in that number I know that it's that's the only product that I need to show repeating this experience is not that big a deal. But it still has to be extremely fast and efficient so.,
