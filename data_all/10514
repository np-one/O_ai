but next step is to actually get the catalogue upload to us so there's a couple of ways to be done method one which is faster and less effort for you guys is you just have any feed any food at all that you currently have today either it's going to your current provider some other vendor whatever may have you just give us a copy of that however easy that is if you have if you put it on an FTP site we can pick it up from there I don't know what that looks like but we will take the owners of converting that into an unboxed and standard format okay the second obviously method is a little bit more work for you guys there is a rest of API that you can call and upload the feed directly into our system okay so hopefully method one will be easier step two or step one point three is the analytics integration so this is this pretty straightforward do you guys use tag managers.,
