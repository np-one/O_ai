so for example I have a marketing team so inside the marketing team and have a Jay and Bob Monica Raghav sandy so any ticket thats coming that's coming into the marketing team is going to go to these six people and I've also set up automatic ticket assignment in a round-robin way which not between nothing but you know let's say I have eight tickets coming in the first one will go to a Jay to anther to Bob for to Monica you know six to sandy and the seventh one and again go back to a Jay.,
