Yeah so it based on add to cart or any action any call to action is basically captured when we actually show the recommendation widget it could be<>. And we can define those call to actions as well so do you want to look at recommendations based on the clicks that the product gets do you want to start doing recommendations with the sales orders that the product actually receives or do you want to do it as a combination of the two. There is something that we can work towards when we initially built out in your cases that are actually too many of such products we can probably give a higher weightage to clicks and a slightly lower voltage to the actual <incident> we can probably say 60-40 <ratio> so we can we can work it out.,
