further every call or every email that you're starting to do from within the system will be tracked in your recent activities and I was also seeing your website earlier when Balaji was on the call as well so just like you have a support forum on your website where you you know you can enter all the information and you know take this information regarding the support query to freshdesk you can also do a similar thing from your contact us page to fresh sales so all your sales related questions are brought into the system directly so let's say a client is interested in your service or product this is enter all the information and click send as soon as send is clicked the system starts tracking their activities the system starts tracking all their activities right from when they viewed the webpage so this is one of our test accounts on our website so he's come out come up on our website to the apps page he's landed on that page and then he's moved on to the signup page and then he's filled up the form and gone to the signup Thank You page and then the system automatically creates in lead under his name and then it assigns to one of our sales representatives and further a few in-app activity is tracking is done where you know you can configure the system to track what is happening after a date download so let's say you have a download brochure form on your website you can see if they're actually downloading a brochure you can you can track activities that are happening inside your application as well and then you know your sales reps outgoing calls are tracked further you know the lead stage movement there's their activities on your website again and depending upon every activity of the contact or the lead with the system their lead score is automatically increased so the number that you see right next to the contact is actually his lead score on a zero to ninety nine basis so with every conversation or every phone call or every activity of the contact on the website his lead score continuously increases so in this way you will actually be able to differentiate between a junk and the genuine lead and focus more on the more important clients yes yes and regarding the website tracking once the form is filled even activities of the client prior to the filling up of the form will also be noted so all that we have to do is just make the point fill up the form so that you know is cookies from his side or activated and we have all the information of his activities on our website.,
