actually I would like a bar I think that just provides better without changing screens or so probably a bar and I got to figure out it's just above or just below the current menu bar 
 so I was looking at pure <> bracelet today with my marketing team and we were just kind of reviewing some of those questions and I don't know that we're decided but I definitely want a bar on the home screen .,
