Okay and then some of these techniques diversification etc are very popular for apparel maybe that's what applicable to grocery But I since it is part of our sort of offering what we also do is try to mix in the result set that so you know a lot of times in apparel world showing the same types of product do results in higher get rates so let's say I came to a category called dress I already saw those dresses that I saw up top the first time I came in and in that same session I again come back to the dresses category showing me the same product is not going to help. So we started to diversify the products based on what that customer might have clicked on if there was some brand affinity etc some pricing filtering that they might have applied or color etc we try to create some diversity then there's some new arrival products found variety in terms of style to Sara so we do that as well . And then the comes in the freshness piece this is where more heavily trending on the definitely have attending on the apparel because every eight weeks you will get new style so how do we make sure that we start to sprinkle in because otherwise new products will never get to see the light of day right only the best performing products will always be up top so this is where these freshness component also brings in and the ways some of the clicks on the fresh of the new arrival product heavily to give them a little bit better boosting because they don't have as much history behind them . And then the comes in the freshness piece this is where more heavily trending on the definitely have attending on the apparel because every eight weeks you will get new style so how do we make sure that we start to sprinkle in because otherwise new products will never get to see the light Well .,
