It will definitely be a different cookie so the idea is if you're if don't log in on either devices then we may not be there's some fuzzy match that we do based on IP addresses but then again if it's a residential IP address it's a little bit more accurate versus if it's a corporate IP address it's not really so much so there's some fuzziness to is that we apply but if you're not a logged in user it becomes a little fuzzy in terms of tracking you from device to device and but if you are a logged in user then based on that exchange of that anonymous ID we would be able to track you from one device to the other.,
