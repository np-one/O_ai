No but yeah with us this is automatically taken care of multiple spellcheck don't have to do anything on it we do provide an automated stemming say bench benches as an example that I showed last glass glasses other stemmed word could be knife knives game gaming center central system is able to understand all of these and start showing the results Differentiator that we bring to the table is also filters so it's it's important again to show the right set of filters when the customers are looking at say hundred products or 200 products as as an end result of the search screen for them to narrow down to the right set of products based on their priorities. Now here with filters the way we approach it is say for shoes as a category you would want particular set of filters size ankle height width casual shoe type. Now with us irrespective of how the customer search is speed shoes casual shoes for my shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes and they might come in and say men's adidas as far as 75% or more results are from a category shoes the shoes filters would automatically kick in right that's taken care of. Now we take it to the next level by making them more dynamic meaning say over a period of time people were clicking customers working more on width as a filter then size then width filter would come on top and size would would come down. Variances I I started to carry a few products in variances if I'm not wrong but then the the onus on the customer to find the right variance image so say here for an example red dress start showing you all of the dresses which are red but still showing the primary images which are black blue gray giving me the first feel that these are these are not the red dresses available but this is the eighth one this is the only dress that's that's available in red.,
