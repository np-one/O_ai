Yes. Charles so if all your products right have it in the same way right just like this one so if all your batteries have 14 have their capacity as number one right and their voltage in position two and then how many cells in position three we can use the machine learning to make these as facets right. So we can come in and say now these values are actually the capacity of the of the battery right and it automatically becomes a filter. Now the challenge would be in this product you have it here but in say the other product it is it the center or it's towards the end then that would need some sort of data cleansing.,
