okay okay and the second thing actually looks what is the auto suggestion itself there was there was two things I observed one is when I look for a product or the feature I actually have a guided Auto feeder that actually comes up which is textual but then I've also seen when I start looking for a specific model number I do some imagery as well so that way it's pretty decent but what I also wanted to do was a understand from when people are actually buying products on your site I'm assuming that people don't come to buy just one single product they probably buy more than one product so I just wanted to share some layouts with you as to what we've tried doing for some of our customers and Tommy you might find some of them helpful but overall some on auto suggest in the UI perspective I don't think there's a lot of issues on the side today then look for the current synonym detection and correction and and also how do you manage stem the words today like thermal management somebody could look for heat management obviously those synonyms in one case did not show me any results while thermal management actually showed me 32 results then I look for switch versus switches right one takes me directly to a navigation page but one actually gets me to a search results page which has way to many options which is because the intent of the customer is probably not changing too much by a switch or the switches but the experience is drastically different .,
