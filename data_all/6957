the one thing we've tried doing this create dynamic filter faceting so we're a for every product or a category we allow you to define facets say for casual shoes you can define all the facets relevant to casual shoes and then the user can come and look for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes you not have the word shoes it it would be mens Nike vs Adidas the results will appear in the same order of attribution and then it's dynamic where if we figure that good is a more click filter than size then width automatically moves up on top right and the similar use case could be on shirts where you define specific attributes or shirts you can search for casual shirts formal shirts t-shirts and it will appear in the same order and then if we figure out that probably a sleeve or a fit is more popular than size and they automatically show up on top.,
