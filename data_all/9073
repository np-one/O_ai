Sure so let's say let's go back a little bit there we go so the way the segments are Is here we are showing four segments but you can create custom segments also so the first segment is user type I can have a new user or so repeat visitor then device I can have desktop tablet mobile based on a device based on geography our geography segment can be down to the city level and then the next is the channel you can have it through email channel SEO PPC direct organic social media etc so you can have it by channel also and there is a technique that we have also introduced where you can have custom channels let's say you have figured some DMA data or you have your loyalty customers and you want to talk to your loyalty customers to email differently then your non loyalty customers to email. Then we give you the ability to create custom campaigns or custom segments as well. Okay and that's the go ahead.,
