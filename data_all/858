and a few things that we've I doing differently especially in the product discovery landscape we have solutions to cover the entire gamut a Site Search has been a bread and butter it's been our first product a core product but over the last six years we've also innovated to the entire spectrum today we so product recommendations we help you power category pages we have a recent product that we've launched late last year called segment and target where you can essentially personalised products for your end users based on various segmentation logic as well I can take you through that and we have a visual merchandising tool if you used InBecka experience manager something very similar but a lot more comprehensive and a lot mostly curvy why to actually use it and all our products are under driven because we understand early as in landscape this is fairly important and what might work for a similar retailer might not work for you right so we understand that it is very impressive so what we do is we have a POC model where we can actually come in do in Page Ajax methodology where we don't have to deploy any of your resources but we can still take your site up and running in four weeks with our solution you can either test it offline and a staging configuration or you can probably test it we'll say five of traffic and what we can also prove to you is in a eight week window what level is your baseline metrics is for search rate conversions we can prove it to you that we at least will know 10% or better so that even before you actually use our product you can actually test it out so that there is actually value to what we are actually talking about.,
