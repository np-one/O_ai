no problem and look this one last edition that in a test we sometimes do a non-inclusive test which we called us in page Ajaxt essentially you give us your header and footer NTDF tagging we do the head HTML induction so in this way we're not doing API base we know don't consume your engineering sources most of the development work is actually done at our end and then once we put it together we can even run a three-month test well for for an extended period of time we can do an a/b test versus an existing platform so that you could see if we're actually doing much significant higher conversion number which could probably prompt you to take a decision moving as well so we could make that feasible but again I leave it to you I understand in stringent timelines but I told I just want to let you know that this is an option available.,
