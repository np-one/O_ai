So this is something that we do by default for so if there are if there is any case that a customer lands in a zero results page on your site instead of showing him a bad page what we do is we add these two recommendation widgets. And the intent of these two widgets is this actually we just recently viewed gives an option to a customer to go back and this is your top seller widget this gives an options to a customer to go forward and this is completely customized again depending on the user. In recently viewed what we do is we looked at the products seen by that user in that session I could have spent say 10 minutes on your site before actually ran into the zero results page so the products that I have viewed in the last 10 minutes the and any call for actions are performed in those 10 minutes. It could be adding a product to my wishlist reading through product details of that product all those actions are actually captured before these products are actually shown to me so that it's more personal to me that I would actually go back and re-look at these products. And then the top sellers uses the same popularity theme that we spoke about and shows the four products which are most relevant for me so that I could actually click on them and move forward and this is primarily done so that there is some engagement available even if a user accidentally lands on a zero results page. So this is another example I just wanna show uses again more than from a UI perspective so that for a user who is say looking for something or navigating to a specific set of products he doesn't have to be taken into a new browser window.,
