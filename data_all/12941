yeah I I think I appreciate that kind of high-level talks because I was concerned that we're you're gonna want to jump right into everything I'm like oh my gosh I don't know that I'm ready for that but like I told you previously it is a priority for 2016 I feel like I told you I'm with Forktail I don't feel like the value I'm getting in return is worth what I'm spending I feel like you guys offer a better value proposition when I just compared you to foretell I'm going a politican I get search and and recommendation and so I do look at that as a great combination and so we have a lot what you're exactly right we did come up with our list of priorities we did that over just right after New Year's we met together as a leadership team and we have our long list of priorities and I'll be honest with you we did search on one of them but I feel like it is part of the website experience which is what we're trying to provide a premium website experience but that's a sub kind of a detail within that and so.,
