yeah I'm split on that because so much of our stuff is is I candy for customers and again my challenge with search and I guess it's everybody's challenge but unlike some sites where people maybe with groceries they know they know what they like and they want to get it you know they're in they're looking for something specific we have a lot of casual browsers who may not understand what they're looking for they know it's a helmet they don't know that it was used you know they know is may be used in World War two they don't know if it was American or German you know what I mean so it's it's in a way taking a vast knowledge and trying to spoon-feed it to people who don't have as much experience with it we certainly have plenty of experience collectors who buy from us but now as we're expanding and growing it's more guy in his you know thirty two who watched him Private Ryan and goes hey that was a really cool movie I love that you know that that hat that guy wore when he she can buy that somewhere you know what type of thing but he doesn't know what it's called he doesn't know what's called an officer's peaked cap you know uh he just goes World War two hat and so it's making that experience really easy so sometimes thumbnails are really good because that's how they recognise.,
