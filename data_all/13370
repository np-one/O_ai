absolutely so let's do on the search piece I want to show you some examples one I want to show you our back-end dashboard obviously but also the search I want to show you some examples of how we actually evaluate search now because you don't have because we don't have search today it's hard to sort of evaluate it but the way you can evaluate search is five distinct elements that you need in search one is the type a head right that is the first thing a customer with Boolean records when they start using search and so what I want to show you is different verticals to give you an idea of how we design search and how should we think about approaching the solution for search that differentiates you from your competitors right so here's parts warehouse obviously they're not from your vertical but this is a parts warehouse where they sell parts for appliances and they have two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the vacuum cleaner they have so what parts warehouse did was they had to search boxes to accommodate for two different types of users one for parts and one for models so we obviously came in and said you can't do that you're putting the onus on the customer and number two what if the customer picked the wrong search box in that case we designed one search box and as soon as I start to type in Dyson you can see on the left you have parts with part numbers and on the right you have models with model numbers here's another customer which is apparel customer very different kind of catalog and obviously very different verticals so here we want to make sure that the customer gets to engage with the product and with the categories so we show all the different types of categories and sub-categories show popular products and also show some keyword suggestions.,
