rep,oh yeah exactly still yeah i know so that's fair so alex what i'll do is i know you got a balance i'll send you the proposal i've also put everything in writing and i'll tell you what page is they are n so it will be like an agreement right to review it let me know if you have any questions and we'll take it from there.,
prospect,um this week yeah you want a good good question you're not gonna hear from me this week because i have an event coming on thursday that last thursday friday saturday here so let's say next tuesday you're back with me.,
rep,so i will send you a thank you note my email and details you can see i am i'm going to be a contact do you think we want to kind of set up a follow-up in two to three weeks to just kind of go over if there are any questions anything for that matter to plan the next steps around us.,
prospect,yeah possibly go ahead and send me that that email and i'll get back to you after i have some time to sort of absorb this and maybe talk to the other folks.,
rep,great thank you john i will send you the details and we'll connect in a couple of weeks.,
rep,yeah yeah so we call it and we use it in this particular email this is a search abandonment email for one of the travel companies one of the biggest travel companies in india so if a user has searched for a flight and he has not booked the flight in 30 minutes a very personalised hyper personalized email is sent to the user we have a case study on this which is published on our site i can share it with you.,
rep,there is a one time integration cost and there is account management and services these three are the moving pieces that define a particular pricing what i'll do is post this call i'll send it across to you i'll send it across a few questions and post that if you if you can just provide me with those you know values in terms of your monthly active users and your contacts registered base i will be able to give you an approximate pricing around it.,
prospect,and give me a pricing based on if you exceeded the number of events.,
rep,okay okay understood so the next steps for us would be i'll send it ac- send across those questions to you and manpreet also will be sending across few collaterals post that what we can do is if at all we can have a you know short call scheduled this week just for a 10 to 15 minutes where we can discuss the pricing and move ahead then.,
prospect,so send me the email.,
rep,sure i'll i'll send across the email by today itself and then we'll await to hear back from you and take this forward we are more than excited to you know have this engagement and association with you started do let us know if you have any queries from us.,
prospect,gotcha so that makes that make sense you know i know we're running out of time but i'm so i'm interested in digestion can you share at least whether it's this version or another version of the deck that actually has some of this information so that i can i can dig into a little bit more as well as i want to get in and i wanted to spend some time with rick and then the shank head of what his what his thought process was based on the conversations they had with you guys and see whether there's some other other avenues that we might be able to kind of play around with and as well do you also have anything about your merchandising workbench.,
rep,sure and i'll definitely take you through the that whenever you have time i'll probably need about an hour to do that effectively and simply reporting both for your autofill for your search and your category pages where you can go and drill down by every query by every product type and see how each query and product is actually performing and you will get some fairly comprehensive report like this is a high-level overview of all your top searches top clip products top order products and zero results and then you also can go and deep dive into every single query and see how every query is actually performing for you like you can go and look for okay a jacket is a query you have high-level business metrics here but then you can drill down to see what is this query associated to from a product standpoint so that suddenly one week this conversion drops from three point seven eight four to three point two eight you know what products went out of stock which is why this query actually dropped its performance so you can do some fairly comprehensive analysis with the reporting we give you and .,
prospect,sure sure that's  what i plan to do i'm gonna i'm gonna introduce you folks to to the folks in our purchasing group and our procurement group that's over supply chain and they'll they'll reach out to their their specialists in those areas.,
rep,this interesting i appreciate the all that context i know we're going a little bit at the time yeah what i might do is i'll send over some additional thoughts whether today or tomorrow especially touching the ecom space.,
rep,i'll send that over and then i'll follow up with you probably in three weeks we can get time on the calendar in four weeks and then we can just go back.,
rep,all right sure so what i'll do darren is right after this call i'll summarize on a couple of things that we discussed now and send you maybe a couple of links which is nothing but certain solution articles that you could always refer to you know maybe during the set up or let me also share certain sets of training documents because once maybe charles has helped you set up with the system you could make use of these training links to you know get yourself accustomed with the system to.,
prospect,okay that sounds like a great next step and a route i don't know if you want to keep the either contact between us and they will figure out you know how to pull off that meeting in the 11.,
rep,you too and pleasure.,
rep,sure i think we can speak to our core engineering team that works with aws to you know kind of come up with a way to you know have archived it or you know even delete it from the aws servers.,
rep,perfect sounds good so so so when can me touch base with you again.,
rep,alright alright perfect so me and jeku will touch base.,
rep,so so yeah so so what i mean so i think the best next steps would be is you know so probably just let us know a good time where we can you know go ahead and schedule a call you know with the rest of your team.,
rep,got it's perfect so if that works and that's fantastic i do apologize alex not only was i late we did a terrible job in the study here so sorry about that not not usually an unlock styles i wanna assure you that so if you're ok we'll send you a calendar invite for the same time on thursday and we'll do a study on g dot and at&t dot as a punishment will do twice top of the sites and and will give you the same report again what i also want to do in that meeting is also walk you through once we've done the analysis and the study that gives you an idea maybe it validates maybe you maybe you don't know or learn anything new but if it validates independently of what the thing that you already might be you might be already aware of what i want to then do is also give you an idea of how we solve some of these problems what does the approach look like from unboxd perspective and what also do we do in terms of technology and the differentiator so i can walk you through all of that as well.,
rep,sure absolutely john so what i can do is i can give you the procurement point of contact you know with whom we are working as well as you know i can give some some names of the stakeholders with whom we are working currently so we already have the msa in place  so there is nothing that stops us from to work with honeywell so honeywell is already a customer for us and i can i can share more details you know with you.,
rep,yeah you know what that sounds like a plan jesse so when would you like me to you know schedule this setup call for you.,
rep,i think the best thing we would be to follow up like i said i'll be brief as a team here and then work with amanda to follow up with a next step son working with gotham coming up how can also you noticed any other further questions on the fresh sales side quick that's always. enough so i will probably send an email as well soon after the call okay good and so i i will send an email soon after our call in which you know you can always come back if you think you have any queries you can also probably you know go on to the signup form on fresh sales and just try out the system to see how it's coming along to your requirements and then you can always come back to me if you need any assistance.,
rep,so what we'll do is after this call we will send you the same presentation i used for this call as an email plus i'll also send you an implementation document. you can go and review all the information and if you have any questions you can let us know and then we can probably get on a call again next week if you i can get an engineer on the call as well. and if you have any more technical questions you can ask that person and then we can go ahead accordingly.,
rep,absolutely pranil we will be in touch with you and the last thing is what we also do with customers in similar situations where and they are in contract even if they share their existing numbers is we run an a/b test right in parallel with whatever the solution they have and let them choose which is better right which which completely comes from the conversion rate if you see enough in conversion rate while running a parallel a/b test against whatever your existing solution is you choose us you don't like it or you don't see enough conversion increase there's there is no contractual binding with unbxd.,
rep,okay great i'll send you a follow up email pranil.,
rep,so we have a lot of other elements from that as well if that's what you're interested in is that more closer to your team's purview and not that easy search we can set up another 15 to 20 minutes of your time maybe next week or the week after to see if you will be interested in something like that for your category pages not search but for your category pages for example.,
prospect,we'll go review it and then if if and then we'll look to if we're interested set up more time with you and i think that's.,
rep,okay no problem so what we'll do is we will send you the decks that we showed and again this is just for us to let you know what the opportunities are and we will await your feedback.,
rep,so yeah so what we can do is we can send you this deck do review that if you have any questions we can set up a follow-up call i'm actually based in new york so in case you want us to meet any of your other team members and do a demo in person i'm happy to do that as well and then we can discuss next steps also.,
rep,okay thanks again mark thanks a lot for your time ashish will send you this deck and we look forward to hear from you next steps.,
prospect,yeah that's what i do it that one oh but the av testing has one so listen i really do call this a new discovery call that i'm doing and if you don't mind following up with some opening clips in order to set up poc what you required for me a little bit of breakdown the implementation time for us in an email it can help me start carrying the conversation internally .,
rep,so what i'll do is i send out the support we have prepared for you you can obviously share this internally and let us know and if there are certain customers and you are industry you want you want to quickly talk to just to figure out how their experience has been with us we can arrange for some references as well and then you could let us know what could be a good time period for you guys to probably take this up as a project and i'll also do one thing i'll probably send you some comparison between solar and us essentially what solar gives you by default what is that you could do with solar and what are the challenges of working with solar and how we can help you overcome those challenges so when somebody in it looks at it poc will probably be going through that day in and day out they can quickly relate to some of the use cases we are talking about and and it's yeah if it makes sense to them if they want us to do a more deep technical call happy to engage with them and talk to them about the back end technology because everyone talks about relevancy and machine learning it's more of a bad word out there but we can probably break it down and help them understand as to what exactly are the use cases we're solving for.,
rep,yeah absolutely i probably the same document that we sent over you can review that passed on with the team and and then we can reconnect whenever you think the time is right.,
prospect,if i could just interrupt in one second here for you um i see great great opportunity at what and what you're sharing with me and i appreciate really what you've put together i know we've got we've got kind of a hard stuff here a check required  a little bit beyond do you have any do a send us the summary that you put have together and b i'd like to set up a time to call you back to kind of discuss what your what your model is what your what plans do you have you.,
rep,we can do that i'll send you this deck and maybe you can you can suggest me on the timings whats best you've with you answer just couple of slots for tomorrow and day after and we can do that.,
rep,cleveland ohio okay i can i can maybe see if any of my representative is in the area and also maybe sort of something face to face but obviously we can surely set up something telephonic and we can continue this discussion because i would still need another half an hour to 45 minutes to complete the remaining part of the piece of the presentation.,
rep,10 o'clock your time great i will send an invite.,
rep,half an hour okay okay we'll set as half an hour thats fine i will do that.,
rep,yes i will send you the doc and i'll also send your data requesting if you can share some site statistics then i'll also like to present some numbers in terms of what is the kind of revenue increase that you can see post unbxd.,
rep,so that is typically what we wanted to talk about in the cs report then what we've also done is we've kind of documented all the feedbacks and suggestions that various users gave us some of them we already spoke about the entire guided autocomplete feature the the showing those relevant basically the relevancy when it comes to longer tail queries and all of that have come we've kind of compiled here we'll share this report with you so that you can review this and.,
rep,it delight to hear so any and hopefully you liked what you see i'll email you this report. yeah <> who is basically get a time from you probably i mean anytime early next week that george would be available so that all the three of you can on a call and we can then deeper dive through and and explore the product explore the analytics we'll go explore the reporting and the other <> that's what.,
rep,absolutely sir worries at all thank you so much for that what's for that great well i'll have course you like of a and look forward a talk about next week.,
prospect,yeah i would say like ah tuesday wednesday's better actually i think.,
rep,wednesday is better okay let's okay i filed instead of something first half of wednesday and we take it up from there .,
prospect,we're we're in vancouver pacific western pacific concert pacific standard they're based out of vancouver.,
prospect,alright cool yeah i mean like i said just i'm super busy right now but why don't we keep talking about this via email there were any info you have for me i'm gonna listen to my searchspring contracts and find out what's going on.,
rep,i just want to make sure that you answer all your questions if you have any i can answer them i understand you want to figure this out first before you take the next step so take your time don't worry about it let's just figure this out so we know we're else at least helping you some part and then we know if it's search and recommendations we're definitely helping you so will at least know to do that the right way anyways .,
rep,got it perfect so i'll wait for your email come leash and we'll piggyback off of that email we'll reach out to nilesh based on that and help you test out this navigation quadrant hopefully we are the solution will be very excited to help you on that then i can charge you a million dollars right.,
rep,see all right awesome so maybe we'll speak next week and try to reach out back the following week or the blue  you can see the face behind the voice it's not pretty but if you can. touch paper or either way lauren louie shouts and just let us know give us guidance we want to make sure we put respect to your time and availability but just give us some guidance some advice so we're not wasting your time and optimising your time.,
rep,and so next week might be a little tricky can we do the following week we go march 20 or february 29 . oh yeah.
can we do wednesday march 2nd is that a good day to do this.,
rep,2:30 so can you do three by any chance 3:00 pm.,
rep,and hopefully we'll connect again on march 2nd and there's any question in the meantime obviously please don't hesitate to reach out.,
prospect,if if you're the point of contact in terms of information can you just send me an email soft put them beside so in case anything our staff has with the particulars and i could get back to you .,
prospect,yeah you know so i'm so i mean if you have some examples of the platform or any presentation maybe that you came forward that would be useful understand also how the platform but i mean it's pretty straightforward so i mean you just have to i just have to copy basically your your code .,
prospect,so yeah i'll be just waiting for for yeah for some links.,
rep,okay and i'll talk to the technical team in terms of trial we can probably try you know and see if we get some more more conversions also i'd be happy to use it on them on the email side.,
rep,okay all right awesome let me know if you have any questions if anything else comes up and we'll be more than happy to walk you through that and if i don't if you don't hear from you we'll try to reach out to you again thursday or friday of next week.,
rep,absolutely my pleasure and you know if let's say you want to kind of schedule a follow-up call with a broader team once you have a chance to discuss this we were open to setting up you know an hour an hour again to kind of maybe go through the similar things that we spoke about and also answer any questions they might have both from a technical standpoint and also in terms of some of the implementation details and poc etc.,
prospect,no um i think this has been really helpful and helpfully and you can set up another caller soon with a wider team i'm sure that they'll be just as interested in it as i am so thank you.,
prospect,i know it's like i think so yes i think that that would be the next step i would like to see a little it like i said if you can send me some of the deck i have two or actually get some of you know the cost do we have that in the budget right now i mean we are doing a big upgrade on the site to really make it more commerce focused so there's a lot of projects in the works right now.,
rep,absolutely and i think in the meantime i met what we can do is before the end of may we can do a a full-fledged demo of the product so you can see exactly what the details are we can talk about the cost piece we can get that ironed out you can talk about the technology the integrations or talk to the technical folks etc.,
prospect,yes probably next week would be good.,
rep,alright perfect so we'll send you a calendar invite for friday the 21st at 11 am pacific.,
rep,i see so andrew and i can certainly do that we can add to this analysis some more elements around mobile and more of our ideas around what mobile should look like both on the category pages perspective and search and also from our recommendations piece as well what is me let's say you do like this what are the next steps in your mind how would this work i know you have to get approval from a lot of people but i'm assuming we also have to come out and talk to a lot of people maybe present this against larger group.,
rep,okay and if you can send me that information that i sent over that way i can get an idea that roi model for you and talk about and how we will take along those ways as well and what that means from our from a revenue impact perspective and a conversion perspective that i think that will help under the dialogue move it forward as well because i know that the roi is something that was important too to see as well.,
prospect,just give her a heads up so she has some requirements on it so she can also participate in the meeting and come forward with those questions.,
rep,perfect so if monday tuesday of next week is possible or thursday friday of next week i have much more availability and and and if it is also possible can we do that next meeting in person so that we can also you know put those faces behind the voices.,
rep,i just gonna add that the collar piece whatever business pieces that connor wants to sort of go over we can certainly cover any questions he has and more stuff that we want to show and early next week or late next week when we are there in person get more than me more than happy to cover those.,
rep,alright we could back with you i look for that information as well and then to lock down a time for early next week for us to come down and present on the business side and to meet all the folks in person so we're looking forward to that and again appreciate the time i know we went over so definitely appreciate your time and i look forward to speaking with you guys shortly.,
rep,absolutely so in the meantime what we'll do mary's efendi the roi sheet so you have it i also send you a templated customer agreement so you can go through and see what what we talked about today is in writing it's absolutely clear and if you don't mind maybe in a couple of weeks we'll just reach out to see if you have any questions we won't bother you to answer any questions you might have and after a .,
prospect,yes i mean i think a month is fine like i said we're not in a position to make a move and we're not gonna do anything this year so i mean even if you follow up i'm not going to be answering any any alternatives right now i mean the test is interesting but we have a lot of stuff going on internally to be able to fit that into our road map this year it's probably not realistic but you know will will at least look at it and give you give you our feedback.,
rep,and yeah so i'll send you this deck thanks so much for everybody for your time and we'll follow up probably in a month's time but if there is anything in between you want us to connect upon after you do that.,
rep,we could come in and integrate the solution in four to six weeks and then generally we keep it a very low cost for the poc usually under ten thousand dollars. so that you and this is primarily the actual cost we would incur in integration and you could test the product out for three months see if it makes sense and as i told you we guarantee you a 10% uptake in conversions you don't see that uptake you can walk away no questions asked.,
rep,yep and i'll also send you an implementation approach document we can do implementation in two ways because if today you're using solr or elastic search we can mimic the same response that your solr is given today to your application or your elastic search is giving to your application so that it will be a very simple integration. it's a simple api that we will build out we'll give you the api you will have to just integrate that or we can also do an in page ajax kind of a model where you create a page and give us your header footer and an empty div tag and we can do a html injection. and we can build all the conflicts in our end so irrespective of in each of these cases either of these cases actually we can go live in four weeks and then you would have two months to test the product out to see if you're actually getting a business impact out of this.,
rep,so yeah i'll i'll just send you all the information end of day today you could take a look at it feel free to ping us if you have any questions and we will wait for the next steps from you.,
rep,okay so maybe you know post a call something that i can do for you is maybe set sent out an email with the study that we put together i don't know abhishek already shared it but i'll i'll do it and and and as a next step you know maybe i'll you know send out some of those questions that we need to share you know that we need the details for so we can put together some ballpark pricing for you as well . and and the other question i had justin is also what is the time line look like i know you're migrating to a new platform and then you said it somewhere early summer you know how soon are you looking to implement a search solution if at all.,
prospect,yeah so our time line is which we hope to have the site running you know towards the end of the summer so july august and we don't necessarily need to because it is it's a fairly large conversion to us because the legacy system that we're coming off of getting off of it is clearly it's a lot more complicated than we had originally anticipated so the search can either follow that or you know if we tagged down to at the end of the conversion before their lives ideally it would be done you know after the new site is is up and running so i would imagine it would be sometime in august so in your mind.,
prospect,yeah i think for you i mean if you let me you know i probably just might be interested in the ro i mean even if we you know just give you numbers for even like let's say a three month period or something that would be kind of most interesting and making that decision and outside of that i guess i can also send you i mean in terms of scrutinizing the data that that would be coming out of our system is that kind of where you have banks.,
rep,perfect so i know the email like we discussed with some of those questions and and yeah maybe i'll reach out to you sometime next week to see what our next steps should be and you know if we can jump on a call to discuss pricing.,
rep,okay got it sounds good in that case i think what i can do is i can send you this deck right and maybe i would want to reconnect with you in 60 to 90 days because.,
prospect,okay um well send me the deck and let's just stay in touch.,
rep,no problrm so i'll send you this information so is there a specific time you want us to follow up the weeks of now a week from now just to see where we are .,
prospect,oh let's see take a look at the calendar i would say in probably maybe three weeks like that two to three weeks maybe that's the run around a week of the twelfth because i know we've got you've got some other other things in the in the hopper here but i don't know realistically if we'll get a lot of a lot of time to really discuss it and go through it before then but that should give us enough time .,
rep,so i'll definitely follow up and if you want to do some testing in q1 let us know and we'll be happy to pick up that project man do this way and in the meantime have some air ideas to what kind of searches that we are talking about i can at least give you the pricing information how much it will cost .,
prospect,and then what i do is i can i do two things one is i bet the solution to see if the solution is something that we're looking at from a strategic perspective and then what i do is i kind of help you guys out with the next level of sales.,
prospect,okay but i will you know i will start talking them a little bit about okay you know when are you guys going to be ready to start looking at some feature improvements and segmentation personalization things that those sort of elements because right now they're really just working on the fundamentals.,
rep,okay so what we will do this we will share you share you the report that we presented and we will wait for your feedback and i also include my contact details for you and yeah wait for you for next steps.,
prospect,cool all right well let's take that as a next step kind of maybe send us over some verbage and kind of on paper how kind of what our options are to move forward and we'll discuss internally and we'll take this schedule call for for next steps.,
rep,yeah i know we've kind of not gone through merchandising or any of those sections so what we can do this next steps go through what i will do is then send you this document i had prepared and also send you an implementation approach document you can review that so next call we could answer any questions on implementation we can take you through our merchandising dashboard i think that's a huge feature that we offer as to how well you can actually merchandise at our solution and then before that next call if there's an nda we have to sign i'm happy to do that and then if you can share some of the metrics probably we can also have a quick call on how the pricing structure might work because i want to make sure it makes sense for you guys and then we can discuss like steps and look at you the poc sometime this quater.,
rep,<> yeah i'll i'll maybe bother you before right before christmas you know wish you christmas and and get a quick update then and then if not then we can surely connect back maybe they first a second week of jan then.,
rep,i'll send you the dashboard i'd send you a snippet of the presentation so that if you can just look at some other features and i'll also put together a pricing document by the end of the day so you can also look at the pricing.,
rep,and this is ballpark numbers for now especially from an implementation piece standpoint and then yeah we can reconnect probably tomorrow or when we have the right time.,
rep,i'll do that i'll send you the copy of this presentation is it possible for you to share data about your site with regards to say what your average order value is what your conversion rate is. and then i can put in some numbers the roi numbers in terms of what you'll spend with us versus what you can expect in terms of increase in in revenue so do you think that would be possible for you to share the data.,
rep,so i'll send you this i'll send you this deck i can send you some high level pricing numbers and i could share that with you ben. and just curious what what do you what do you suggest as next steps do you see the possibility of doing a poc with unbxd any sooner.,
prospect,yeah i mean we we the two of us need to kind of get that presentation and share it within our group and then we'll have to discuss that within our group and we do kind of a general staff meeting every couple of weeks that we should do next week and we can probably talk about it. then see if just kind of see what the see with appetite is and the interest is and we'll we'll take it from there so and touch base with me and maybe ten days or something like that.,
rep,sure maybe say next wednesday would that be okay i can maybe put up a place folder for same time ten minutes kind of quick status update and and connect with you would that be fine with you.,
rep,okay i'll have rohit block your calendar right away for ten minutes next wednesday same time in a meantime i'll send you this and if you want us to present this again to a larger group if you want to get into a much more deeper dive into a technical discussion with monal whom you heard on the webinar just feel free to let me know i can i can get him on the call or i can get some of my other engineers on the call and <>.,
prospect,yeah i think something that would be helpful would be if you have like a technical overview sheet of the options on how this is implemented because that's what at the beginning of the call i didn't get a real good firm understanding and i'm not the one that has to implement that.,
rep,okay awesome do you also want me to put up this the pricing numbers and then in the form of a formal contract and send it out or do you just won't listen what an email.,
rep,okay i will i will do that we reconnect the later this week or early next week would be a good time for us. to do sometime next week.,
rep,absolutely do this document and we'll send you four or five questions we need to put together a proposal for you and then we can come back to you.,
rep,alright we'll send you a summary email  we'd send you the deck we'll send you the questionnaires that we need answers to we'll send you a proposal once we have answers and then we'll schedule a follow-up after thanksgiving.,
rep,what are the next steps how are you guys evaluating this what's the time frame what's the what were the hurdles that you see to adopt something more in newer technology like ours.,
rep,so what are the next steps gary help us out here i know yes yuo've probably had some more questions around the technology and we are more than happy to come down do a bigger presentation maybe a bigger group needs to see this but what's the process and help us and guide us here please.,
prospect,okay this is very very interesting we'll give with you <> and paul and kind of make some some decisions on next steps you should we contact.,
rep,sure and if you don't hear back from you know what what what would be a good time frame for us to quickly follow the to end of this week next week just curious.,
rep,yeah absolutely so shannon and mike i know you obviously like what you see what are some of the next steps is there some sort of a conversation that we can have how we can help you maybe you want to test it maybe there's an opportunity to do this small poc. where you can see it sounds great you talk about flashy stuff but let's see if it actually works and we actually will come in and guarantee an uptick in conversion by the way during the poc let's say you give us a test for 90 days. we'll come in and set it up for the first 30 to 45 days four to six weeks roughly takes to go live you can test us for the next six to eight weeks or 12 weeks if you want and within that time frame we will guarantee an uptik in conversion. if we don't or you are unhappy for whatever reason no questions asked you have the option to walk away.,
prospect,could you um possibly send this we'll review a bit we can discuss at may be it internally and then we'll reach back out.,
prospect,we have a lot of work like i said to do on our side it looks like the catalogue to customize the facets for each one of the items so we have a good amount of work on our plate now so i appreciate you showing this to me today and we'll definitely be in touch here very very soon.,
rep,sure charles any any timeframe you have in mind maybe two weeks four weeks down the line i can put a placeholder maybe reconnect with you see where you are and then see if we can take <>.,
prospect,yeah perfect i was gonna say actually let's touch base in two weeks and see where i'm at and we'll go from there.,
prospect,<> solution to process the database and have the twenty thousand product with detailed custom field in the csv to allocate <after> search attributes to.,
rep,sure in the meantime will it also be possible for you to send us a sample catalogue maybe not all your products may be say 100 products 200 products just for us to see how your product catalogue feed looks like today and how the data is been you know i would say is attributed as of today.,
rep,can you share that data with me and i can maybe run that with our team here to see right and how we can use the data and if there is a better way for us to approach the faceted navigation without you having to do anything at your end.,
prospect,<ohh so potentially you could provide my faceted section>.,
rep,yes but but we would like to see the see a sample catalogue from you so that i can confirm<>.,
prospect,yeah i can i'll send you a hundred items in a csv in an email.,
rep,okay okay that would help.,
prospect,okay great great so let's do that let's touch base in two weeks i'll send you the catalogue today with the hundred or 200 items so you can you know and i'll put some variety in there so you can see what we're working with and what we have. and you can provide a solution a cost-effective solution for the fact that is for all the facets and assigning attributes for the facets for each one of the items i'd be very very interested in hearing that.,
rep,sure i'll surely i'll surely work on that with my team.,
rep,okay awesome so i'll send a quick invite for 15 minutes discussion on monday tuesday first week of april and we can always change it if you're busier on your time but just to be on your calendar i'll put a placeholder.,
rep,is there anything else that you feel that is not moving forward or that you can help you with if if you do this let us know in the meantime.,
rep,we'll send you the agreement and we'll keep bothering you until until we have something something to work on.,
rep,yeah absolutely yeah yeah ill send you the contract as well ill probably need time till probably another 2 3 hours to send everything together but you’ll have it by evening today.,
rep,ill probably need 2 3 hours to send everything but ill but you’ll have it by evening today.,
rep,so yeah i'll i'll just send you all the information end of day today you could take a look at it feel free to ping us if you have any questions and then we'll wait for the next steps from you.,
rep,okay so there are two things we would need one is we will put together all this terms and conditions on our contract paper including the evaluation poc everything and send you the contract. if you can just execute on that contract before you go for your vacation that will be really helpful and in parallel what i'll also do is i'll basically do all the whatever is the integration checklist that we have i'll basically send that to you. then what we can do is once you're back probably on 25th or 26th of this month or monday the week after monday or tuesday we can set up a one-hour integration call we would ideally want both you and alex on that call unless you have about if not one hour at least thirty minutes next week where you can just login alex will be in the office so we can do the integration call next week itself so we just need that initial <>.,
rep,what i'll do is i'll just send you the contract today take a look at that and you can sign off it will only call out the 90 day evaluation period that we discussed and then after that you let us know as to what time next week will work for alex and you. or for now i can just tentatively send out an invite for next monday for half an hour to do a quick kick-off and then after that we can start working with alex. we will probably just need a read-only access to your google analytics and probably some information from alex so more from a tech side.,
rep,that's about it and might think we can start working parallelly and we can take things live as soon as possible.,
rep,yeah i'll send you the copy of the contract today let me know if you have any questions otherwise it it will be on a cosign document you can just review them you just do a sign-off on the document itself and then in parallel also send you a request for next monday for 30 minutes and also send you an implementation.,
rep,okay i will send you an invite for same time on tuesday and one thing that will we have appreciate a lot david as if you can actually sign off on the contract before you leave for your vacation because that will just be helpful.,
rep,okay anyway if you have any questions i'll include our contact information as well you can just let us know and and for next tuesday same time i'll send a invite for an integration kick-off call and we can then take it up from there.,
prospect,okay great um so i guess next steps are i need to go and find out and see if they are big enough to do a campaign like this and then get back to you.,
rep,if that is something that's that's doable we'll be more than happy to kind of get into the next level of discussion and also what i can do is maybe we can set up another call if they're okay we can set up another call with them show them a much more detailed demonstration i kept it very short at this time given the time. but if you have one hour i can also walk you through the backend merchandising dashboard wherein we can show you how you can control some of these elements at your end right how can you manipulate a few things and then can walk you through that as well.,
prospect, okay so next for us or anything else you need from us.,
rep, no i know so i think what i will do is this will get separated out as two so this would be at signup and this would be post poc something like that and then we'll just spread this out to say 5k like this let's say will be high end something like that and then these two still say the same i'm assuming and and i'll revise this language as well for that.,
prospect, yeah so if you send the revised so we need to do a couple things on our end i get approval from senior management and probably unforeseen more importantly we have to talk to our dev team about when we might be able to actually implement this we're pretty backed up at this point so those are kind of the two pieces that we'll have to kind of think through internally.,
rep, alan deborah okay all right fantastic well we really appreciate the time thank you again for keeping us in mind and i do appreciate you giving us the feedback on the pricing so we'll work through this i'll figure out my end as well and you'll get the revised contract in your hands in the next hour.,
rep,if this works for your team right what i would request is if there are any slots available next week for us to have an implementation kickoff call ideally we need about 45 minutes <within> and i will send you what are the things that i need before that call primarily like i'll give you email ids two email ids for which read-only access to ga with your catalog files you can send this to us with xml json or even a csv. our team can start looking at the data and then we can get things started and i also on the fabula of the business side i'll put everything all the pricing details and a contract and send it to you like it clearly define what is your price for the poc and if you decide to continue with us from april 1st what is that will be your monthly charge and i can include all of them.,
rep,okay sure if you can just send that data i can put everything back into an roi calculator and send that for your review.,
rep,and then chris i'll schedule this kick off call with my tech team any other questions you have feel free to ask them they will be happy to answer those and if there is a slot available for next wednesday for about 45 minutes to an hour you can let me know what is that time slot i can make sure that my engineers also will be available for the call. eric the search data that you spoke about if you can put that in an email i can just prepare the roi and the contract and email that to you and we can probably have a quick five minute chat in about an hour's time and so that i can just run you through all the clauses so that you understand all of that and then we can discuss next steps.,
rep,awesome i'll just send you a message from my phone and i'll call you in about an hour but if you can just send me the data i can just start working on the paperwork and send that you for your reference and in the meantime if you can just check with your team what time next week works for them for an hour call that will be really helpful.,
rep,so yep so i'm dropping email that all things all the details that we need just to make sure that we've gone through your staging environment so just figure out how yeah then come back with what all he implemented you know what is the approach you take and the time so i'll get back to you.,
rep,all right sounds good mark i can go ahead so i have all the information i need just to get on with the next steps i'll drop you  email with all the details and all the accesses that we require and i will get back to you all right.,
prospect,of course of course sound should get perfect yeah and the next call we have i'll have my director of development that takes care of that was supposed to be on this call today but unfortunately he was called away from the office could we would there be availability on your side to our reconnect on the 24th so which is wednesday in a week.,
prospect,okay so what i like to do monel would to be to set up another demo if you will if you don't mind repeating.,
prospect,now some of mine with a product managers online and a technical manager of mine.,
prospect,so you know look at its ass and talk about next steps with the team who's actually going to do stuff.,
rep,okay so let's have two follow-up meeting uh i'm timing out because i had something at 2:30 but why don't you send me an email and i'll i will i will propose a new timeline where with my crock ladder my technical person to evaluate this collectively.,
rep,okay so based on your availability jonah i know you probably want to take a little bit time to review the agreements but what i also want to request is your and maybe anybody you think on your team who should be part of this implementation call say monday or tuesday your time,
rep,okay all right awesome well fantastic so to do to the 2:30 pm tuesday eastern we'll set up an implementation call and we'll go from there,
prospect,okay alright why don't you make a note to follow up with me on friday and we will touch base there let me and let me pull some numbers to see yes but we've got enough people interacting you know the behaviour on our site where you know a tool for this okay.,
rep,so i can share these presentations also and whenever you have a little more time i can also take you through the dashboard as to how easy is it for you to actually merchandise using a product. because that's where we all make money right how do you merchandising the product how do you merchandise for search how do you merchandise your category pages everything is on there i can actually show you.,
prospect,okay yeah yeah i think that that would be interesting yeah if you want to try after this call if you want to send you can if you want to you can send over the deck if not just in the follow-up email and let me maybe schedule 30 more minutes if that's okay with you to go over the dashboard.,
rep,yaa yaaa so i'll send you the deck for sure not at all do let me know when you have 30 more minutes either today later part of the day or in this week i'm happy to get on another call and basically take you through the dashboard.,
prospect,okay great i appreciate it it would be it won't be today.,
rep,no problem <> yeah folder talk to you later this week then.,
prospect,okay so i actually have a meeting i need to run to so we don't have time today for the search but i will look at that at a later time so now that i understand you have the evaluation ability that's that's that's great.,
prospect,so my next step is to i need to go to my it department to speak to them about this project which is it's going to be twofold one is to install google analytics and the other part is to drop in your your widgets into our site.,
rep,it's also carlos if you would want i can i know you didn't have time but if you have another 15 minutes or half an hour later today or tomorrow i can take you through our analytics as well it comes default with the platform so you don't have to pay anything for it but it performs much more stronger actions than what google analytics would i can take you through that as well.,
prospect,yeah let's do that at another time for now i'm pretty good and so our outreach back out to you again.,
rep,yeah and if we want to set a time for say early next week to connect again or you <>.,
rep,okay no problem we'll ping you as soon as you back and we'll connect.,
rep,so yeah those are the only things i had from my side as the next step what we would like is you know access to your staging environment in magento so then you can even put in our plugin there start getting them again you know.,
rep,i will send details over an email to you.,
rep,all right so what i do is that i drop you an email a little later today and share all the details with you and then.,
prospect,do that a little later just send an email and ask for the product recommendation stuff.,
rep,alright thank you so much for your time and i will drop you an email who live in the bay and we can get start accordingly.,
rep,got it perfect that's that's fair enough as far as it responds so i'll send you this document anything else that you are looking for matt dan from my perspective that i can add for an issue with information.,
rep,i will send you an email with all these details in a bit and i think i'll let you get it started and so looks like if you beat your routine  may take another couple of weeks to finish all the changes.,
rep,so we're on april to start off on our end and i agree we should not take more than two to three weeks to get this once these started.,
rep,are you talking next monday you would want it by next monday that's gonna be you're talking about 9 9th november that's gonna be a bit tough because i'll have to get my resourcing down accordingly i think it's gonna be trying to cut it a bit too close that may not work out but let me do this can i get back to later in the day to see how soon we can get this done.,
rep,i'll just drop you an email with the access that we require so that i can you know get that done you know at least half installed today itself and then your team can you know get working on the recommendations piece and in the meantime let me figure out a resource so that we can get this up and running quickly but i have feelings so yeah 9 gonna be anything too short so let me see i will definitely try getting something and done and when are you actually planning to take this whole thing live.,
rep,yeah so let's do this uh you know once you've given me the access today itself let me just assess you know what ha other side does and how much effort is required if it's something straight forward i'll let you know how much effort it's gonna take to actually get something up and running otherwise what we can definitely do is make sure at least we have our autosuggest so then you can demo that and you know some of the very basic functionalities of search so let me see once you give us the access i you know get to see the side and i'll let you know how much effort it will take it out oh yeah something pretty simple and straightforward so it shouldn't really get too long so we figure that out.,
rep,okay got you so okay so i just drop you guys an email oh you know the email id that should be given the access or in case you're giving us the admin access that's just fine and let me just get back to you little the day but the timeline is and what we can achieve early next week later next week and so.,
rep,okay so what we require is a read only access to your ga account so that we can start looking at how people are making searches on your site and it also helps us should what you know before and after to figure out how best we can find you our search to make sure we get you better so .,
rep,all right great so i dropped you an email with all these details and some of the requirements that we have from your end including the ga access and the design for the search box and in the meantime i'll try and get the autosuggest and the recommendation designs ready in the next couple of days and share those with you.,
rep,absolutely totally makes sense so thank you for saying that also first taking the time what i like like i said again once you get to the evaluation please don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything any questions that may come up before we need to decide on a particular path we'll be more than happy to jump on a call and provide whatever feedback you can send us the catalogue will at least have it looked at be ready whenever you guys are ready what is it the time calling then for us to reach out to you and start bothering you again say sometime the end of february beginning of march or is that too late.,
rep,alright awesome so we'll wait for your email colleen on the 4-h fall catalogue will be ready by end of february with our analysis whatever just direction you take will support you where you need us and it will take it from there.,

rep,and lorraine we will try to come up with a few time slots between this week and next week to see what your availability is and we'll schedule a demo for you as well.,
rep,that works okay and your eastern time so we'll keep that in mind and once we go through this robin i guess and we also have to look at broncho so we'll take a look at that as well and if everything works out by the time you come back we'll have answers for you we'll schedule something once you come back and we'll schedule an implementation call at that time to determine specifics and specific timelines is that a fair expectation.,
rep,so so what do you think our next step should be oh you know how soon you want to take this life i just want to understand some of these timelines so that i can have my team down to work accordingly.,
rep,alright so as next steps unfortunately i think she was not able to find a reliable wi-fi to join the call can we schedule a call i can i apologize to do this although i in 15 minutes you might have to do another call anyways so what i wanted to request is do you have any availability to tomorrow early morning afternoon preferably that works for you you can schedule a call 30 to 40 minutes typically is what it takes and she will run you through all the minutiae details that she needs to know and you can help her guy a little bit business your end obviously to figure out how to design the solution and she'll figure that out start the implementation and then you can see what the timelines are you can see what you can expect from us we will tell you what we expect from you all of that stuff that a fair request .,
rep,tomorrow morning and i'll try to block an hour of your time however note that it will only take 40 to 45 minutes unless there's a lot of discussion and back-and-forth then we'll may may need the full hour okay .,

rep,okay so what justin's going to do vicky is send you some metrics that we would like to get back we will put together an roi for you and then also propose an yosi so it gives you the opportunity to actually deploy unbxd and a pfc environment and based on what you get back i'm assuming we will do a commitment on an uplift on conversion and if we don't hit that you simply walk away no questions asked no cost etc so it really makes it very easy and straightforward for you and you get to actually see firsthand the success that unbxd will bring to you .,
rep,absolutely so justin after this call will send you email that we're looking for get us those numbers back to us the metrics back to us and we can have that next conversation as soon as tomorrow early next week whenever it makes sense absolutely.,
rep,if this seems interesting i know you have an emergency to attend to but if this seems interesting as a follow-up what we can do is make we can send you some questions if you feel that in nda is required to answer those details send us your nda or we can send you our whatever works for you we get that executed and you share the numbers and we'll sue then and our why to you so you can see what kind of roi not only that an uptick in conversion that your your expecting for what does that roi to look like by investing something in our.,
prospect,yeah i can do that because i i run all his i mean i'm kind of working on a deal with him where we kind of manage everything for him anyway so i do have access to some data and it's not like this guy is completely price adverse just so you understand this i think again we can lock him down yeah.,
prospect,could you send me an email with all of the data points that you want and i will email you.,
rep,yeah i'll send you that but on high level i see this customer on our lower pricing band approximate around thousand dollars right is where i see <>.,
rep,okay yeah sounds good i'll send you that email and then wait for the data from you and then we can we can look at maybe an roi based pricing and if not then we can give him a flat price i'll work on that.,
rep,sounds good so anything that you would want from me at this point in time anything that i could i could send across maybe that helps your evaluation or decision-making i'd be more than happy to do that.,
rep,okay great thank you jeff thanks thanks a lot for for spending time with us jeff and don and if you have any follow-up questions feel free to reach out to me or sharath and and we'll be more than happy to connect with you and answer any questions you have.,
prospect,great would you mind sending out us the deck after the call.,
rep,well in terms of next steps we just want to respect the time you guys have to go to meeting but in terms of next steps what are your thoughts.,
prospect, i think we just need is that you are gonna send over the deck to us.,
prospect, okay you said you're gonna send over the deck to us.,
prospect, okay yeah i think um there's a lot of information you guys provided i think we'll just need to take a second look and kind of derive out all the important information that we can present to both our director and a senior management and we'll just have to see if we can get this proposal approved.  so right now the balls on our court and we just need to see if this is something that we can acquire whether it be for q4 or starting on 2017 in q1 so um if we have any questions we'll definitely keep in touch with you guys this project we actually have another project kind of higher in priority so this will be the runner-up.,
prospect,especially because black friday is ahead of us and that's a very busy time for us so it would be best i stayed to follow up with us maybe the first month or first week of december.  if that's okay with you guys i will try to see if we can get this proposal out to the board as soon as possible.,
prospect, okay yeah well definitely consider that i know you guys have very different ways of implementing our vision across the search function yeah so just send over the proposals and over the deck we'll take a look and we'll try to get in touch with you guys as soon as we can.,
rep, okay i'll also hook back with you guys just in a couple weeks and the other ohh you will have black friday but also go back with you just after you confirm you on that the documentation and then we'll continue that dialogue.,
rep,yeah so what do you recommend as a next step jeff when what.,
prospect, let me let me meet with next opr tomorrow some other company convert i forgot what to call this i'm not so interested in them anyway but and then probably a week i'll let you know either put.,
rep, so when you think jeff would be a good time for us to connect back and then maybe say.,
prospect, give me around two weeks.,
rep, okay cool sure jeff we'll connect back with you yeah in the meantime if you have any questions at feel free to shoot me an email i'll send you the deck right away after this this call so that you have the unbxd information with you handy.,
rep,cool do let me know what should be the next steps is there a specific time you want us to connect next week or.,
rep,the only thing i could say we will show the value rings it's very difficult as a tool we discuss things theoretically and unless we show the value so what i'll do is i add about 10 to 10 white for the week after for say a wednesday or thursday i'll walk half an hour just to discuss proposal and happy to answer any additional questions you have and if you give us a go-ahead post that week we can set up an implementation call me and take next steps so what i'll do now just so that you have all the information that you are send you the deck and send you a high level implementation overview and i also send you the pricing so that you could look at it in multiple ways then and then take it up from there.,
rep,back next week there are the following week whenever you think would be a right time. why don't you shoot me an email like next friday i gotta get in touch with a few other folks on my team you just what the pricing is like and because i think that you might what you're doing might save us on the ux side so we'll see i'll figure this out thank you so much for your time. i will send you this presentation and and some of the shopify sites for every view after this call.,
