rep,at indian east india company now by the way why this happens alex i'm pretty sure what you have to do in celeb rose is to create any kind of stemming suggestions you have to actually create synonyms on the back end so if somebody was looking for indian bayonets let's say or indian guns versus india guns you have to create a synonym that indian in india might be the same depending on what you might have used in the catalogue right.
prospect,hmm.
rep,so you're creating tons of synonyms on the back end where.
prospect,it is manual.
rep,right exactly you got it then next comes is the site search process so i searched for spare barrel carrier now i understand that you definitely have tons of carriers one does show up and you can see none of the other ones are.
prospect,yeah i actually i don't know that we have many spare barrel carriers but i know what you mean yeah.
rep,got it well you definitely had a lot of japan flags and maybe when i looked for japanese flags some do show up but i just happened to type in japan and flags and none of the flags showed up.
prospect,yeah that should japan flag should definitely pull up.
rep,and i'm not making this up.
prospect,i know i'm doing it i'm doing it right now .
rep,right now yep .
rep,the next piece what i really wanted to also highlight was couple of other things one was after a customer searches let's say i search for flags and i wasn't necessarily sure which flags i was looking for although there are countries and a lot of products and eras clearly defined right the question here is any query that i fire the filters which is the next most important thing from a customer experience perspective it's pretty standard and now the products that you sell are definitely in a certain niche however i would certainly imagine that if i'm looking for say knives or swords yes maybe military or nation or conflict might be very important in terms of how customers narrative involves town but it's also important to note that there are certain attribution to those categories that'll become more important i don't know whether that's true or not out there because giving the customers the same standard filters doesn't necessarily help it make it easy for them to narrow the results down if you realize that for certain categories of products certain filters are more important you can easily do that or navigation right if you wanted to come in and say let's do headgear i want to do helmets for helmets you can easily say you know something but let's assume that is lucas travel down a strap size for example right head size is clearly important then maybe that's what's more important to show up top versus if i'm looking for a sword maybe the lens the material whatever that case may be so in navigation it's pretty straight forward because you have a very different hats the customers going down however you can search that is not the case so what unboxd allows you to do is also allows you to create very specific filters without any manual effort i might do i want repeat that without any manual effort to be automatically pick that up when if you defined it for the navigation category which is the last thing from any user experience i wanted to share so that's that's that i know syllabus is pretty good on spell check so if i were to you know maybe misspell something like this you know it will figure out that maybe i'm looking for headgear just be careful there's some copy here like an html copy.
prospect,yep.
rep,you know and then did you mean is just randomly sitting there.
prospect,yeah.
rep,no that's just something that a customer if they read they might just might feel like it's not clear that's all.
prospect,yep .
rep,however what celeb rose is not very good at is <> or spellcheck and i don't know if you get a lot of them especially mobile you'll see them was particularly and the last bit was if the experience on desktop versus mobile and that's the last piece i wanted to share i see that your site is responsive but you can see here if i were to do any kind of autocomplete it's pretty much the same as it would be on desktop but you know that in mobile this section gets covered up because of the people.
rep,mm-hmm. only see this if i wanted to really see something else you have to <> scroll down. mm-hm so that's it that's what we wanted to just quickly share with you to see if those things are something that's interesting to you or .
prospect,yes yes that is interesting to me now one one one other question other thing i want to point out huh which you may or may not be aware of the we well we looks like we have traditional categories and we do the way in which our navigation works is every page as a search results page so if you if you navigate traditionally so go hover over militaria on the on the header and go to original antique guns hover over that and then go to clean and complete antique guns and okay so this is actually a search result page if you search clean and complete antique guns this is the same thing would come up.
rep,yep.
prospect,so we have and i did this for a couple of reasons one well the first thing is so this gets influenced also by user behavior so we may not assign something to a category necessarily but if it's if customers are constantly finding it or you're you know searching on it with related queries it will get pushed into the search result eventually. the other thing is sometimes our customers don't know many times don't know as much as we do so they may not know that the martini-henry is a clean and complete gun.
prospect,so what it allows us it allows us a more little bit of a broader spectrum this way we're not limiting our search or our categories specifically on what we manually placed in them do you know what i mean.
rep,yes i totally understood what you mean do.
prospect,you guys offer a link search in navigation.
prospect,yes i do okay all right well then that that's what i mean that's all i need to know.
rep,okay all right so and i and i realized that also because what i the first hint was that every time i would go to a navigation page it would say for sale and we have a good a surgeon would say for sale.
rep,and i was like may be.
prospect,what reason we did that is because we discovered that when we took away our category landing pages and things for just search results google started to not they didn't depreciate them but they didn't wait them as heavily because category pages tend to have more content and if google sees that it's a search result page it tends to depreciate a little bit so by changing it to for sale we've actually seen quite a big bump in seo.
rep,that's interesting.
rep,and so i would imagine that the url saying search results for clean.
prospect,that exactly that's exactly right so if you if you pull this url i am a usa dot com salesperson result japan's flag if you or whatever is you know i'm sorry i was on my screen.
rep,okay.
prospect,if you go to that url right there antique the url that we just looked at.
prospect,and search that in google.
rep,ya.
prospect,no just check out the results.
prospect,and it says clean and complete guns for sale oh no no actually yeah yeah you can do that or you can just what i was gonna say is take that whole url and search it in google not in your not in your navbar you got to go to like a yep now search it put it in only we're still gonna bring it back i can it's weird i have a little on the upper-right of my browser that allows me to.
rep,i think this is horrible.
prospect,ya ya bang see queen and complete antique guns for sale original so it takes out all of that search results all the unit so we we coded it that way now that wasn't celeb roast that was me i mean i you know i told celebra that's what we're doing and they should do that for their clients to link search enough.
rep,thats very interesting although i did realize that when you use certain urls and are powering through search you know and that's exactly what we do as well because these urls is what tells google that it's not a search page first of all and then second it actually uses keywords from this url and rates them very heavily also.
prospect,right.
prospect,yeah but that's yeah yeah so so in absence we yeah and not actually we've seen a nice increase in seo because of it don't we.
rep,got it okay so what what i want to quickly also do for you alex if you have a few minute extra hopefully what i've shared so far is relevant and what i want to do next is i want to actually show you some of the other elements of what unboxd does and how do we actually.
prospect,ya absolutely.
rep,fantastic so let's see okay so unboxd obviously from a technology perspective.
rep,alright.
rep,so let me show you all five elements of how unboxed are starting with the type-ahead the search results relevancy the filters and then i also show you show your merchandising dashboard on the analytics.
prospect,okay.
rep,and so let's start with the type-ahead itself what i want to show you is that we understand you know a lot of customer who are vendors alex will come in and say oh we understand your business we will design everything for your business blah blah blah okay by the way what celebra says done for you not that they have had company or anything like that it's a pretty standard implementation every celebrity employment action looks exactly like that we actually understand how customers buy from you and why do they buy from you because there's definitely a lot of other players who sells some of the products right so there's certain differentiation  that you have.
rep,not really.
prospect,not really not really.
prospect,but that's okay.
rep,maybe that's a differentiator and that's a differentiator right then you have something that's unique nobody else sells and whatever is unique must be highlighted in such a way that it comes across as that .
rep,you know be easy to find yeah.
rep,we got it so the question is how do we understand business and how do we design the solution so i should show you some examples they're definitely very different verticals but what i wanted to give you an idea of the versatility of power what our thought process you know what our solution looks like okay so here's first customer parts warehouse you can still see my screen right i just want to make sure.
rep,okay this is part warehouse we have two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance with their pieing the parts form so parts used to have two types of search boxes one for parts one for models and they could only optimise one at a time so we came in and said you obviously cannot have two search boxes one because you're putting the one of on the customer to what is the choose the wrong search box and three you can only optimise one at a time so we combine the two search boxes into one and this is what our autocomplete looks like for them we actually split it into two where left shows with parts right shows with models and in parts you see the part numbers and model with model operates all right i'll just type in tyson here's another customer in apparel customer for them what we've figured out is that they have a very big catalogue and very deep catalogue so for them as soon as i type in my first lever and we want to try to guide the customer to the categories that you already have show some popular products based on that loose relevancy ever with one letter obviously but also show some keyword suggestions based on that and these are all obviously and syllabus also says that these are all dynamic butts or our stand in the nature that it's based on user behaviour and over time it changes based on learning from the system this is the last example i want to show you is a grocery customer for them it was in grocery world by the way customers buy a lot of products in a single transaction right i mean if you think of your own grocery run that you might have done that he you buy 12-15 products in a single transaction the problem this customer faced was it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these 15 products so we redesigned the autocomplete to look like this where we didn't shoot hearts to this the left hand side part is actually personalised to each user based on cookie data and based on their past behaviour so what will happen is under the assumption that in grocery most of the products that you buy are the same products that you might have bought last week or the week before or something in the past right so as soon as you start to type something in we show you the products that you bought in the past up front you allow you to change your quantity and add to cart from right here if you're looking to buy products that you normally don't buy we show you some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some category and that is what our reflection was in your search that if i was starting to type in headgear why is there no mention of a country right because i'm assuming since you put nation as the first thing i'm assuming folks come in looking for country bottom first is that correct assumption.
prospect,ah i don't know if it's first but it's certainly important yeah.
rep,right so clearly and there's no mention of a country anywhere near that there is no mention of a category and i know it's not neatly based in two categories but still it is it is a category of a product and.
prospect,yeah and we have the categories there i mean you've got .
rep,is that b .
prospect,and there's no twentieth century yeah i hear your thing.
rep,yep yep and that's what within the first two letters that our customer enters or the first letter that they enter you want to make sure you expose everything to that customer to say because a lot of times customers might not realize that you have something 14th century because they never right there right right or they got it.
prospect,i agree.
rep,you got it perfect so the last piece i wanted to show you was it was on new egg he did so new i had a similar problem they are a marketplace right almost 100 million products in their catalog and what we found eventually is that customers with marketplaces typically buy with keywords and brands that's clearly how they would be really searching for stuff so that's what we end up showing split in that way this is what more i was thinking could be something you can do for users there as soon as they type something in how can we show country era and then maybe products and then some keyword suggestions okay all right i think i made my point cleaners hair the next is the actual search queries so let me show you some examples of search queries.
rep,one thing that celebra stood early on because we were coming from default magento solar search which as you know is a complete joke it actually making hinder sales because i mean it does hinder sales but it might it might be like the reverse the antithesis of search it's so bad we were you know if you if you if you were on our site and one of our sort of marquee products or our antique guns specifically the martini-henry rifle so you could search the term martini and like the first four results would be the parts for them the two sort of like what you were doing and then the the thousand dollar rifles that are like what we're best you know the things we want to sell would be below the fold and so celeb rose and what we don't what i have a staff of 12 i'm one of the only people that works on the site and the last thing that i have any time to do is to go into magento and manually weight rank of products for search i just did not want to do that i wanted user behavior to determine and plus my own knowledge my product catalog to say this is also what i want to feature first so celebra has made a rule where antique guns if they fit into the search query would be weighted more heavily than anything else which really helped us i'm imagining that type of we're going to do that with unboxed as well.
rep,absolutely.
rep,okay
prospect,in fact we do a little bit more than that do you what we what we really get into that i'll share some technology stuff as well for you so you can see exactly how we do it as well okay so relevancy of the search types so we have actually classified up to twelve different types of queries and no other company has done that by the way and i'll give you an example of what a different types of queries are so feature search for example would be lets say an apparel world i was looking for a red dress okay versus i'm looking for a dress i'm looking for a red dress so the attributes the attribution that i might have for a dress is actually in the query itself and that's a feature search is what we call it linguistic shortcut would be more so in your world if i were to look at it maybe the length of a sward is that something like a samurai warrior versus that sometimes.
prospect,i mean we just don't do much of swords but uh you mean like.
rep,a so something with inches for example something as
prospect,yeah i mean that's not quite as you know maybe material perhaps but but we don't have that many attributes for items to i mean like our data the just most of our items don't have attributes beyond the category which they're assigned to which in a way becomes an attribute one of our main attributes is whether something is original or reproduction so we when you serve something the filters you'll see you know original or new made and international availability because many of our items are available to go overseas and you know the same with paypal sometimes some items can't be paid with by paypal..so i've always known that attributes it just depends because you know for instance if you're looking for an antique gun the choice to buy that antique gun is not that it's twelve inches versus sixteen and it's not that it's made out of brass or steel do you know what i mean it might be that french versus english. yes.but that that falls under category.
rep,gotcha okay no that's perfect i just wanted to give you an idea of what the linguistic shortcuts might really mean and used a different algorithm to actually solve all different types of queries so from a relevancy perspective we are if not better at least equal to celebrates in that sense// okay right next is spellcheck now this is again celebes a lot of times can do single word queries spell check easily enough however they cannot do a lot of multi word spell checks what unbox has tested its system and we are automated by the way with celebra you have to actually create synonyms on the back end and i've seen them being created even for single word queries in some instances a customer actually send me a screenshot where they were looking for a trim or grill i think and how many different ways they had to misspell it in the synonym sections within survivors dashboard to make sure that girl always showed up .
rep,so we don't have to do that with us you we have actually tested our system to auto correct up to six keywords being misspelled in a single query and we do three things we are corrected we show all the possible options and we pick the most probable option and start showing results based on that if a customer selects option two or option three over time more and more customers are selecting that automatically it will become option 1 next is stemming so this is again something that you have to do instead of rows a lot of times with a singular plural knife knives etc has to be created as a synonym on the back end out-of-the-box work with unboxd you do not have to create those synonyms on the back end redirects is a customers or something exactly that matches your taxonomy some of your category pages or subcategory pages but matches exactly you we automatically redirect the customer to that page you do not have to get create a redirect whole.. head query searches here if i'm searching for something very high-level which actually crosses multiple categories so let's say i search for a british memorabilia or british artillery or whatever
prospect,yeah yeah
rep,the case may be you know that it's rifle helmets etc different categories etc so we have a technology to solve it two different ways the first way is here where we figure out the all the right subcategories and show them in the right order of importance this is based on user behavior and but we also show products just in case the customer had no intent to really buy they were just browsing right second to make it even easier to browse let me show you an example so there it is okay so if search for alexander wang who is a designer makes a lot of different categories of products so we show all those categories of products on one page easily bucketed we call it a bucketed search so i search arrives in the wang i show tote bags because tote bags are the bestsellers from alexander wang then i show all shoulder bags then i show all dresses sandals pumps so on one singular page i can show all the products neatly bucketed in such a way that if the customer has no intent they still can browse have it intend they can easily get to the category that they wanna get to.
next is the like dynamic filters and i understand you don't have a lot of attribution but this is something unboxd has actually solved well if you have different attribution and you've optimised it for the navigation pages you can extrapolate from navigation into search automatically okay so let's say for shoes in this example these are the filters that i wanted for shoes in this order of importance it does not matter how i search for shoes shoes casual shoes men's shoes men's casual shoes men's nike men's adidas does anyone have to have the word shoes in it we automatically show these filters and in that order of importance and you can have different categories different search terms we automatically extra polite and show the right set of filters this may not be as applicable if you have large filter options we provide search within the filter and also we order the filter options based on popularity.
next is variances if the same product was available in multiple colors sizes at several different images for each one of them we also solve the variance problem if i was to search search for say red dress here i'll actually show the red image of that dress right in sort of the primary image we also have color synonyms on the back ends already built out so this let's say somebody was looking for coffee colored something and you didn't have coffee in the catalogue but you had brown we know their coffee and brown in close proximity to a shade will automatically show brown if you have coffee will show coffee first and then brown  here's some outdated options as far as your results so i don't know what celebra says i totally forgot to check this out for you let's just force this they always just show all products is that the number of products you have .
prospect,might be at this point it that in stock you know probably.
rep,got it it's just showing some products based on i might have searched for cuz my previous search was.
prospect,no it always looked like.
rep,oohh that right oh that's why when i did depends sale or japan flags it showed me that because it couldn't find that term so it's just showing me all the products oh okay cuz it's in sorted by relevancy i assume that it probably just picked up something while i'm on the state got it however we believe there's a better way to do that yeah.
prospect,yeah absolutely but culebra should have pulled up the worl d flags i mean .
prospect,at least these flags.
rep,exactly you got it.
rep,well at least so that's a different case scenario but let's assume that we you did not carry a particular product and there is a way a possibility that you got a zero results page what we believe in today's dna customer gets the wrong that you want to give them the option to go back or to go forward so recently view gives them the ability to go back recommendations give them the ability to go forward you know and these recommendations are unboxd recommendations and i get you have lists track recommendations so what my suggestion would be at least for the zero results page use whatever list track widgets are and use them.
prospect,right yep.
rep,more like these so here what we do and i know again illustrate a step to the ideal here was within the search results if i wanted to actually evaluate alternatives and i know in your case it may not missoni so much so maybe.
rep,ya it doesn't.///
right alright but we have an option where you can quickly evaluate alternatives where we do an implicit search in the market here's how we do it on mobile on mobile we figured out the best way to provide search autocomplete is to do scope suggestions popular queries and recent searches so as soon as you tap into the search box recent searches that are personalised to that user make for the best user behaviour because mobile experiences get interrupted a lot so getting that customer back to where they were quickly recent searches to make a big difference and we've come up with these best practices just so that you know alex by working with some economies like japan and asia pack actually where 90 percent of the traffic is coming from mobile devices.
prospect,so with your responsive solution i mean that's obviously standard for you guys is voice part of it.
rep,so what people have done yes what people have done with voice they it a little bit ha ha what they've done is they'll initiate voice and they'll use the native voice recognition to actually get the key word.
prospect,got it .
rep,right and then they'll just use and.
prospect,you guys process the key word um the but you don't it looks like with with mobile you don't bother with products you are you know with some nails or or any products your you're using just text.
rep,correct because we what we found is that some providing thumbnails one takes up a lot of space however there are instances where we have provided thumbnails for example in the big baskets example when you're on mobile app or mobile web the thumbnail is shown because if you remember the idea was to show products to the customer that they've bought in the past.
rep,it's personalized so showing the thumbnail becomes really important in that case so we do show thumbnails there but in most cases most cases we avoid thumbnails even in apparel avoid thumbnail.
prospect,yeah i'm split on that because so much of our stuff is is i candy for customers and again my challenge with search and i guess it's everybody's challenge but unlike some sites where people maybe with groceries they know they know what they like and they want to get it you know they're in they're looking for something specific we have a lot of casual browsers who may not understand what they're looking for they know it's a helmet they don't know that it was used you know they know is may be used in world war two they don't know if it was american or german you know what i mean so it's it's in a way taking a vast knowledge and trying to spoon-feed it to people who don't have as much experience with it we certainly have plenty of experience collectors who buy from us but now as we're expanding and growing it's more guy in his you know thirty two who watched him private ryan and goes hey that was a really cool movie i love that you know that that hat that guy wore when he she can buy that somewhere you know what type of thing but he doesn't know what it's called he doesn't know what's called an officer's peaked cap you know uh he just goes world war two hat and so it's making that experience really easy so sometimes thumbnails are really good because that's how they recognise.
prospect,they're looking for.
rep,and like i said the the analysis and discovering phase that will go through will bring these elements out which may tell us that you know what we need to show thumbnails and again the way the implementation is done today as we were looking at it the thumbnail section would already be covered with the keyboard on mobile unless i actually scroll down so.
rep,customer is essentially looking at your keyword suggestions which definitely yeah anyways so the idea is should we split it so that's one example so let me just so one is to say if i am looking for elements you know this section will definitely be covered because of the keyboard so in this section you are obviously looking for you know there's tons of space for me to actually split this into two to actually start showing some keyword suggestions and some popular product with images without its extended obviously the extentended.
prospect,yeah titles.
rep,exactly and so that gives the customers also an idea that oh maybe i'm looking for that maybe not and then it focuses them to say oh maybe i should want to click on one of the keywords and then i'll start to get a lip look at the results i'm browsing on so there's some experimentation .
prospect,cool let's talk prices.
rep,yes so we know that we are a little bit more expensive than celebrezze we always have been unfortunately however converting all the celeb rose to murrs what we realised is that if you are more expensive than so rose no customer wanna switch okay so we realised that we price match celeb rose whatever they're charging you we price match to celeb rose.
rep,okay okay.// now typically// what what about implementation charges// got it so give me a little bit of an idea i just want to ask you so just so that you can see you know some celebrezze pricing is all over the place so i have found in rare instances where celebrity is expensive than us just because the customer had a very large aov but that's not how we price our products so how big is your catalog that i saw it was like 1800 to 2k.
rep,yeah i mean of what's currently in stock yes we we add about 20 products a week but the thing is they sell so quickly because many of them are one-of-a-kind./// so can you give me some number of assume like you could have a maximum of 2500 and 3000.
rep,yeah i don't see it going past 2500 of what's in stock i mean if you look at our magento database it's 6000 but most of them are out of stock have been for you know for years.
rep,got it okay no problem and then how many visits do you get or search queries either one of them.
prospect,i don't remember the search queries but we averaged about a hundred we average a hundred thousand unique visits a month.
rep,can you show me how many sessions final chance there's a typically like you know.
rep,hold on.
prospect,all right so for the last 30 days 90-98 thousand users and 140000 sessions.
session duration 3 minutes and 11 seconds bounce rate 55% 500 thousand page views.
rep,what is i love curiosity if'n you use ga i'm assuming.
prospect,yeah
rep,what is your conversion rate for site search i'm just curious on that.
prospect,apparently that's not set up properly and i have never dealt with it and i don't know how to look it up but celebra said it wasn't set up right and they told me to do something about it i didn't do it yet.
rep,okay no problem the celebrity gives you the conversion numbers i don't think.
prospect,i don't think they do.
rep,know yeah and that's one of the other things we also have and i'll show you and i'll just to quickly give you an idea what that what i mean by that is in ga even if you work to set up search conversions let's say i search for japan flags okay and i obviously didn't get any results that i was looking for so i'll navigate and i'll buy flags from from the navigation what ends up being is that google will tell you that that search session had a conversion which is not true because i actually bought it from a browse and based on fixing that principle we actually give you three tiers of reporting that actually identify exactly how conversions happen but to answer your original question on pricing with to 2500 product catalog 140000 visits roughly a month and i'm sure.
prospect,hundred and forty thousand sessions yeah.
rep,sorry yes hundred and forty thousand sessions we typically are around 800 850 dollars per month and i don't know what it's higher than celebers or lower than celebers.
prospect,celebers 795 oh it's about the same.
rep,got it we can easily do 795 that's not a problem.
rep,now don't know whether you were looking to save money because we have also found that sometimes customers feel that what you the value of search is not justified by this monthly cost sometimes i don't know if that's true or not but we have given incentives to switch so for example if i were to price match at seven ninety five you can see me have a better product there may not be enough of an incentive to switch so what we've done typically alex impasse for some customers is we will give you first 60 days to try it for free.
prospect,okay what is the are they're imagining there's implementation fees.
rep,yes all you do that's my question yes so the implementation see because your magento typically runs around $750 to $1000 and it's a flat fee we take and i don't know do you have any in-house it team or you outsourced.
prospect,outsourced it to a company called korah.
rep,oh okay so if you don't want to use them we can you can give us access to your dev environment and we can do everything from design implementation we have an extension with for magento you can resolve conflicts as you know that's the biggest thing you have to do in extensions resolve conflicts q8 tune it etc you tested it in dev when you're completely happy we work with cora or whoever manages the production release we release it into production and obviously give you post-production support as well and all of that is done in 750 or thousand dollars that range.
rep,the range being depending on how much work we might have to do there might be certain things that you want us to change and stuff like that that's why i'm giving you a range.
rep,could be 750 it could be a little bit like thousand.
prospect,okay and the monthly fee if i wanted to i understand the 60 days but if i wanted just a lower monthly fee do you know for switching from celebers do you have an idea of what the best you could do is.
rep,yeah the best we can do is is $600 i'll tell you that upfront i have gone for these numbers for 25000 products and hundred and 40 sessions the best pricing i've given somebody is $600 and i i know they switched there we are currently working on an integration with them i can show you who they are that's what they are today.
prospect,i mean i think 600 with 750 to $1000 implementation what is your how long does it take you to implement
rep,typically takes three to four weeks to implement so what.
prospect,so you guys handle the responsive design from mobile to tablet to desktop you handle all that.
rep,everything that's correct testing is .
prospect,in the navigation and the filtering and everything that's all part that's everything.
rep,oh i totally forgot navigation with navigation the best price i may be able to do is 650 alex i'm so sorry.i totally missed out on that piece.
rep,because so.
prospect,here's what i'd like you to do can you send me all of this in writing send me your proposal in writing at 650 with the navigation i would i'm my senses i would probably have you implemented as opposed to cora because you guys know your product better and cora tends to charge a lot for design um you know and and i'm i want the autocomplete it was what so right now what we have i'm happy with i feel like it we could probably design it a little better as you do it using some of the things that you suggested and specifically highlighting categories but i definitely want products and that autocomplete maybe not for mobile but certainly for tablet and desktop but in mobile maybe thumbnails might work agreed without the long titles so i just want to make sure that
prospect,that's all-encompassing there but and it's 650 and then for that upfront fee i'm very interested so if you can put it in writing and get it back to me i can review it internally.
rep,got it and and you still will be interested in that 60-day first 2 one 60 for free.
prospect,sure.
prospect,yes why not right you said it modal you said it i didn't ask for it got it no problem the only other thing alex i wanted to ask you was did you want me to quickly i know we have only four minutes left walking through the reporting things or you're okay on that or i i have to run i have to bounce but i can i've been in the magento space for a long time i actually spoke this past year i keynoted at magento imagine.
rep,yeah.
prospect,i hope you note on the third day so i know good technology wants to see it i think you guys have clearly have something really good i'd like celebra i mention them quite a bit in my presentation but you're pointing out some things that i've been loosely aware about but nobody had really come along in my in my search in my search for search that was doing better and you guys you guys are but you know basically the celebra competitors and the magento world had been like searchspring and you know all those text-based search which is suck so they didn't really you know the other one was sli.
rep,sli.
prospect,which i wasn't i've never been impressed with sli so yeah so so yes i mean i'm trusting your reporting i certainly i'll take a look at it before i you know
prospect,you'll sign off and everything but this at least if i can get all that in writing review it i want to talk to cora about it do you know if cora is ever implemented i can i'm my senses my usually of korah implement everything for this because i went through it with celebra celebra stood all the implementation the first time through and i think it was easier than having korra do it i mean korra assisted when they needed to but you know.
rep,yeah so from an implementation perspective the biggest problem with any magento is the conflicts right and we know what conflicts you will encounter when we implement which is why we like to do the implementation ah so it's not about a thousand dollars it actually costs is more to.
prospect,no you're losing money on the thousand dollars i know yeah i get it.
rep,the reason is it's a much smoother experience for you it's less headache and we have more control over how exactly we want to do is .
rep,right.
rep,and it's cheaper for you the cora will definitely the.
prospect,cora i'll be more expensive.
rep,yep exactly.
prospect,although i get it great i get it i do get a great rate with them because i've been with them for almost six years but.
prospect,awesome.
rep,hear from you what is a good time to wait and stop bothering again.
rep,perfect all right awesome thank you so much alex really appreciate.
prospect,it all right thank you.
rep,thanks for the sharing.
rep,listen to our story that's i really appreciate it thank you so much.
prospect,no problem thank you for taking time and talking with me.
rep,okay so then on the call i have sandhya with me and sandhya runs our advance analytics solution practice within the us geography.
rep,hi john good morning.
prospect,good morning.
rep,perfect so john i know we only have 30 minutes so i think james shared the deck with you and you know you can refer it along as we go. so thirty minutes that we have john i think the agenda i that had in mind was you know to spend maybe five minutes to give the overview of what is brillio why are we here what do we do for customers overall broadly and what kind of services we provide.
rep,and after that i think you know we want to spend bulk of our conversation going into our big data and analytics offerings focus primarily with the cpg retailers and manufacturers that we work with across the globe and then you know maybe we'll wind up our talk in 15 to 20 minutes and then have the last 10 minutes for open conversation to see what is it that excites you what is that you thought was valuable and then we can take the conversation from there.
rep,does that sound like a plan.
prospect,that sounds good.
rep,perfect so brillio has been now in existence for last three years almost completed third year of operations and i think the biggest thing i know when we started out the biggest question i really had to answer is why what is it that we are coming into right.
rep,there's so many players out there so what is it that we will want to be known about and how do you want to kind of let our clients remember us when they work with us right.
rep,so there are three key things that we wanted to kind of make as deep pillars always be organized right
rep,first was we believe that the ecosystem is changing so fast that you need a partner who is always on the cutting edge of the new technologies that are out there to same problem that existed in the industry for many years right.
rep,so i think our focus has always been on the new know-how of solving problems.
rep,the second deep pillar that we put for our growth and our focus was to say hey we are only going to talk about digital and data transformation and how it kind of helps our customers solve the problem right..
rep,we are not going to look at any of the traditional technology services that are out there which our peers in the industry are focusing on.
rep,so  we said we will stay away we will just talk about digital data and see how these two pillars help us grow.
rep,and the third which became our i would say the most important factor and i think we take up a lot of pride when we talk to our customers who love this service of us is the fact that the speed at which we operate has become something which our customers are enjoying a lot because that has become the primary foundation for everything that everybody is doing today your time to market has become so critical that you need to be out there as much as possible because
rep,potentially if you're two weeks late you're looking at a new technology out there which makes your solution maybe to some extent if not redundant old right.
rep,so that speed to market has become our key thing that we take to our customer wherever we go.
rep,so based on that these three things became our i would say thought process as we started growing.
rep,i think it has been a great journey so far we are now 2600 associates across the globe.
rep,we operate out of 10 global offices.
rep,we are headquartered right in the silicon valley in santa clara and new jersey is our second largest operations in the us.
rep,outside of this london and nordics countries for next big operations.
rep,so london and nordics the scandavian countries.
rep,and lots of customers asks why did you go to nordics instead of mainland  europe right.
rep,because we felt the nordics are i think one of the most advanced countries when it comes to global digital
rep,when we saw them being a great fit towards the global offering.
rep,so that was the reason we went there before expanding into traditional mainland europe as well region right.
rep,in india bangalore is our largest delivery center we work. we have most of our projects larger ones getting out of bangalore. so that's the kind of job .... right?
rep,i think slide 4 is something where i'll spend two more minutes trying to demonstrate it right.
rep,so when we started putting our center of excellence and services together right.
rep,i wanted to align it as i said with a key goal of being a company that uses emerging technologies to solve your existing problems at a pace which is not seen in the industry right.
rep,that's where our service offering in the left hand side you see which is called brillio's magic right.
rep,this is our own swat team as we call.
rep,and whenever a customer throws a business problem at us we have this swat team that consists of domain experts technologists and lot of our data scientists and advance analytical people sit here.
rep,the objective of this group is to take that business problem  understand it and look at how it can be solved and come out with a working prototype that our customers can touch and feel.
rep,everything put together in not more than two weeks.
rep,no matter how big the problem is that we're trying to solve.
rep,the idea is how do we scope it right make it tangible make an impact on our customers of things they can use that feels rather than just saying hey and there's a nice fancy word or a  powerpoint document that you go figure out how we put it up right.
rep,so we are not that kind of firm.
rep,we want to do anything that final proof of concept or a prototype that our customers can use.
rep,and thats where the imagine comes in.
rep,this is our head in all of our conversation that we start with a new topic by yourself.
rep,the second service offering as we started expanding one say that i get a proof of concept i need to bring it to life and i need to scale it to the enterprise level right.
rep,and that's where our digital experiences practices comes in play they're saying bring in the latest technology around ar vr iot wearables content collaboration every thing put together.
rep,its a very very focused approach towards user experience and design things right.
rep,and build that application or the solution at an enterprise scale.
rep,and then you know we move to the next one which is the virtually essential part of the application that you build.
rep,so the number of sends and response is concerned so how do we measure it how do we make the of  and move forward right.
rep,so thats where our big data analytics factors come into play
rep,and i think we'll focus on rest of the conversation on this offering.
rep,by just giving you a broad sense of this practice.
rep,we kind of broadly split it into two parts.
rep,there is big data technology where we talk about everything that is to do with the fact that i can integrate and get the data available for my clients to start using it for traditional reporting and visualisation and on top of that allowing my advanced analytics team to start now building machine learning ai based solutions and even getting you prescriptive analytics right. how do
rep,and then comes our last offering which is we can say that everything which is for the new ... i can't build things in the ... toned way on the technology platforms so the way we build these for at a infrastructure level and a technology level that itself completely needs a rethinking right.
rep,so that's where our engineering practice comes in you know how do i build everything out at our cloud base platform.
rep,how do i make it scalable.
rep,how do i make it elastic.
rep,how do i bring in the complete dev-ops integrations in every work that we do.
rep,we ensure that our customers once they start using solution they have to start changing it acting on to it the cycle time required for that is very quick and very fast right they can scale up.
rep,so this is how  come into play and i think all along our frameworks come into play which is helping our customers you know deliver a lot of value.
rep,a lot more faster.
rep,so with this i will take a pause if you have any questions thoughts i will take time before we move on.
prospect,no i am following so can you give me an example of something i mean its on the the right hand side of slides i think it's four or five maybe that some of the places that you've done.
rep,you've taken this approach to we're obviously on the cpg industry.
prospect,are you able to share any examples of cpg projects.
rep,on that i'll move on and hand it over to sandhya. sandhya why don't you get started and you know show our
rep,absolutely would love to john. so what i can try to do is guide to way that it is big data analytics right maybe i can give you a flavor of what we are doing in various areas.
rep,so if you look at slide six john thats sort our spread of capabilities.
rep,the kind of projects which we do right.
rep,not necessarily a functional view but more of data and analytics view of sorts if i may call that.
rep,so for example in the area of business consulting right again a very data driven and analytics driven approach to business consulting.
rep,we have worked with brands like loreal and johnson & johnson where they sort of wanted to look at their survey data they wanted to look at certain macro economic data.
rep,to sort of figure out what kind of products to launch in each of the markets.
rep,whether that how is the timing right
rep,how do they position it in each of the market based on social media data.
rep,how do they plan out their the key messages and advertising campaigns for some of these launches etc alright.
rep,so that is one example of how we have taken a very analytics or data driven approach to business consulting per se that's you know one example.
rep,another example which we i mean another area which we take a lot of pride in and i think that is ..... are different from a lot of the analytics players in the market and of course because of the you know span of technology that rakesh was talking about right.
rep,its our ability to build business solutions so there is obviously the capability to do offline analysis and provide recommendations you know in the old traditional way of you know giving our deck of recommendations are just provided on tab view dashboards or whatever or .. table stakes.
rep,but i think where we differentiate that ability to build business solutions right while directly not cpg probably one recent example which you know you're very excited about having just embarked is that one of our fairly evolved customers in the  while they are fairly evolved  in their basic analytics functions they're like a very strong analytics group they are just embarking on their journey with cognitive automation right.
rep,so they want to be able to use some of their base analytics capabilities.
rep,they want to upscale that to more you know advance ai capabilities and be able to automate some of the atrocities particularly in the supply chain is right and we have a lot of experience working in the supply chain space like you know inventory optimization or demand forecasting network optimization etc.
rep,so we are helping them bring together that vision both in terms of functionary wherein it is not applicable which of their analytics capabilities can be you know on board to a more ai type of a capability how do you integrate that with your data ecosystem what kind of platforms do you need to be able to you know do this number crunching real time and make it available to decision makers as and when they're making that decision right.
rep,so it could be in the form of simulation it could be in the form of business planning tools or it could be just a dashboard right.
rep,so more.
rep,sorry was that a question john?
prospect,no no just agreeing with you.
rep,yep right so that is you know that's one aspect where we think you know all our engineering and other digital capabilities help us bring together an ecosystem where analytics is much more real time much more advanced and can be hosted and you know brought to scale for decision making right.
rep,so that's aspect where we take a lot of pride in and of course the tab-especially in the consumer goods page that table takes functions which we have delivered across clients like nestle itc coke etc are in the areas of of course merchandising there you know we have solved problems like trade optimization.
rep,we have their workforce simulation tools where they can sort of figure out what they not lift can they expect with what kind of you know slabs or plate of the optimization that they want to offer and again like our perspective is that you know you can't look at some of the decision in silo a file attachment hazard in pricing pricing high impact of the motions and month-out and all of the other interactable types of how are you make sure all of these various aspects come together as visualizations of simulations and forecast statistics behind it right.
rep,the work within the merchandising for consumers with providers marketing is another strong footage especially because some of those marketing concepts are applicable across industries.
rep,so marketing as a function not just within cpg or retail and starting with which we work very broadly across in being able to leverage crm data to actually be able to have a much more stronger view of the pipeline and being able to analyze the campaign's which campaigns are working which campaigns are not working what mix of campaigns will works for a particular product launch on a particular category of products.
rep,what category of product require what kind of marketing and you know of course the standard analysis and you know the whole marketing functions so that is another area specifically another key area which we also focus on is in-store ops where we have helped okay i'll take the example of  gst where we helped them do their shelf space optimization.
rep,so the ones as angle of looking at what kind of product should be in the market what is catalyzing sale for each other and if you you know sort of rationalize certain products.
rep,how will it impact their competition how will it impact yourself in terms of volume and then being able to use some of those insights into their shelf space planning as to
rep,how much how many things should they ask for some the retailer is how many you know how much how much overall space how many sales means how many how many rows of products you require right.
rep,so that is one area which we have again worked in the space of store ops.
rep,another ip we have in the area of store of particularly for cpg function is a shell scanner so that is an ip which we have built jointly with microsoft and we have delivered for  specifically.
rep,so here what its the core capability there is image analytics so what it helps the consumer goods providers do in being able to do the store orders right.
rep,so why is a highly manual activity now where the auditors go to every retail store and you check the whether number of these things are the compliant with what they have agreed to with the retailer.
rep,this is a ip which will just integrate very seamlessly with any kind of smartphone you can just take an image in every retail store and it does all the number crunching at the background that they are we comply in which retailers are generally non-compliant or which regions are non-compliant and actions and you know workflows and actions get triggered automatically based on one click of an image.
rep,so that is one i think which we have jointly built i'm sorry john was there a question.
rep,so broadly john i mean i can go into the details of any of these areas which i spoke about but any specific area of interest that you have any current project that you know you're trying to look for partners i can go deeper into that area of interest
prospect,i mean one question i have for you and that this may be a little broader than that for sure.
prospect,giving what you know or understand about altria what types of questions do you think we would have that you could help us with and i know you're on the outside obviously you don't know the inner workings of us but um given what you know about altria and the businesses we're and the space run and maybe how that's evolving do you do you see any any areas where you think you guys are best suited to help us know
rep,i would think of two areas one would be in terms of of course marketing right i mean there's always scope to position better especially considering the industry that you claim. considering the kind of legal or public you know responses which come up and how where is it is from geography to geography. i think our so we have an ip which helps do social media analysis be able to deep dive into it's not just the social media and listening to it it's about understanding what the topics being discussed what is the root cause for some of those topics and in actually being able to identify who are the key influencers who are propagating that message in the network right.
rep,so that you can target them to position better to propogate messages better etc etc right.
prospect,so one challenge we have with social media i don't know if you feel maybe you could let me know your thoughts on this we haven't really been able to extract all the value from social media because as a tobacco company we're trying to do everything we do very responsibly and not listen to social media per se from perhaps those under the legal age of tobacco use.
prospect,so i don't know is there is there any solution you have or heard of that would allow you to sort of listen to social media but also age verify that hey this you know this message of this comment was from an adult not a child etc.
rep,absolutely actually so the solution which we have while we look at multiple data sources and you know i agree for certain data sources like let's say for certain blogs and forums it's almost impossible to uncover the age of the person.
rep,when we particularly use twitter data the demographic is extremely important factor which we look at across you know industries across used cases right.
rep,so they're the key parameters we do look at our age gender and location so the nlp technique which we have.
rep,while twitter if if somebody has stated their age that data's available the our nlp also sort of has ability to figure out some patterns of you know text i wouldn't say a credit it but our input the age and you know gender of a person asked john.
rep,so what we're done john just to give add on to that right so it's a traditional voice of customer we've kind of built a algorithm that is based on our partnership with us university right.
rep,we are trying to kind of use that algorithm at the back in to get more context get more value around what is who's talking what is it talking about the context of the conversation.
rep,so with  that i think it makes it is even more easier for us to kind of infer a lot of things where the data may not be directly available for customization.
prospect,so you a very some algorithm to infer for age and gender you're saying  do you have any idea if you've done any kind of testing and sorry to probe on this but it's very sensitive topic for us so obviously have you done any sort of testing to understand like what's what a level of precision you're able to predict the individuals age and/or gender
rep,yeah absolutely i think on the of course its not a live in market test its of course a test on a training set right like where we have a training set with the ages and you know what we're trying to infer the ages i think are generally on the gender and age while and not the personally the person who built that algorithm from what i've heard from them this we have a fairly good accuracy of closing in on 90 (okay i know its a challenge) right sorry and apart from this positioning and marketing i think to answer your question john about you know what the other areas we can help i think supply chain would be extremely critical for you especially that this is global operations right. so areas like demand forecasting and not just demand forecasting and you know the traditional demand forecasting where you can do it at the most granular levels of you know humid geography level and be able to generate your sales plans based on that being able to do your inventory analysis based on that so we have i wouldn't call it as a tool or a product but its a very loosely integrated stack of accelerators which we have used to deliver solutions across and an integrated planning tool to come right from like i mentioned demand forecasting to inventory allocation that sort of covered the good span of supply chain and additionally our capabilities with network optimization and inventory optimization i think would be good fit for them not see that.
prospect,so i was flipping through your deck it looks like a lot of their visual sorry the visualization components are primarily using tableau is that correct.
rep,yes tableau is the most popular amongst the clients and hence a lot of our work is on tableau but we have fairly technology and not stick a lot of it sometimes is on click view click sense of late we've seen a lot of power vi happening of late a lot of custom vizualization you know where the inferences or any insights are you know has to be simplified and whole beyond the scope of tableau we do use custom visualizations like  etc as well
rep,okay and other area i wanted to highlight you know given our experience working with  card in the us right so they're not exactly completely spread you know started picking up some wine brands also under your portfolio right i see that.
rep,card and we have realized that biggest challenge they're also facing is you know there are a lot of regulated state there's a lot of unregulated states how to get the actually getting the right point of sale data and kind of people to use that point of safe data now main point of sales indicated how do you get it right somewhere you get it directly from state which is regulated its very accurate compared to the state that are not regulated you just kind of it means anytime you kind of put some conference factor knowing your history and so on and so forth so how do we take that and kind of build out the complete end-to-end analytics for them right in terms of trying to show them how they're doing per state what is the profitability by product what is the price sensitivity price elasticity so in a lot of and this is not something as i said you know john its not that our customers are kept doing this for the first time and i think it's not that brillio is doing it for the first time for them right i mean we think coming into play where they're seeing value is uptake on the accuracy and uptake on their ability to start using it more and kind of integrating it more in their ecosystem right.
rep,rather than it be standalone solution somewhere that someone has to go and fetch and figure it out themselves i think two parts where we are kind of and i nowhere claim that you know we are solving something so unique that our customers have not heard of it we are not and we don't want to fool ourselves but i think where we think we have been making difference with cpg forces uptake on the accuracy and uptake of how we are able to integrate it in the ecosystem for them to make it more actionable and usable on a day to day basis rather than being something that is somewhere that someone has to go and then you know refer to a start and come back and do action right.
rep,so eliminating those two has been i think our claim to fame and that's where our advanced algorithms some tweaks here and there how do i make my absolute a more integrated to your integrated planning module product so forth those kind of things come into play when brillio is kind of working with our customers.
prospect,okay well um i've got another good sense here i apologize i did have an 11:30 that i have to head out for but i appreciate you taking the time i'll take a look through this material and if i shall have further questions who should i follow up with.
rep,this is rakesh john
rep,sounds good. thank you
rep,for any questions would that be okay
prospect,okay awesome
rep,so quick background about us so we had a barrier company about seven years now in existence work with about 120 brands across the country fashion and home improvement is where we found our most success especially with the large enterprises we work with express through 21 i just started working with ann taylor and loft started working with hsn in the home in the marketplace division we work with ashley furniture and bed
rep,bath & beyond in the home improvement space and here in new york we work with fresh - that were other large grocery retailers the good thing about the product is you could be on a custom home loan platform or you could be on an enterprise platform at atg or websphere or even hydros the solution is completely platform costs any questions are the so far uh no not yet right so just before we get salad i just had two
rep,questions one is do you use adobe seen seven but what's the platform and what do you use the search today to start quickly check with you first
prospect,so first search we we have recently engaged with the adobe am platform so using their search and promote tool okay
rep,fair enough right and as a company guys we have three primary product lines a site search has be in our core product we also help with product recommendations and you can also power your category pages with the entire personalization and segmenting target into the peak and at a back end you have a merchandising tool if you used endeca in the past almost everything that you could do it and it has experience
rep,manager is something that's available but it's more of a 20-17 dashboard it's more drag-and-drop much more easier to use and for a merchandiser it works like a charm so that's a quick product suite that the cater to right and one of the few things that we do differently that's how we differentiate assets with everybody else out there everybody will talk to you about infrastructure availability response time we do that we
rep,give you a sub 3 a millisecond response time irrespective of where you users within country i'm regarding to you five nines of availability but beyond that we understand this entire product discovery landscape is very intrinsic just because we work with ashley or a bed bath or a hedges chen and if you're doing well for them does not mean that we do well for you as well so because your business might be very
rep,different and the behavior on the site would be very different so we have a poc model where we essentially come and have a low engagement poc where you don't have to deploy too much of your resources we can take the site the product live in about a month's time and we give you eight weeks to test the products and in these eight weeks we get into your ten percent lift in conversions you see that you could
rep,continue with us if you don't see that you could walk away no questions asked so that's this gives an opportunity i
prospect,have a question i mean i i would i don't necessarily want to waste your time on search um we we signed the contract with adobe a few months ago and where we were signed in with their search and promote tools for three years so we would we wouldn't engage with you guys on search just wanted to be completely transparent about that okay so but i've actually
rep,prepared this report from a search experience so let me do this i'll probably quickly run you through what i found on the site today and then probably talk to you more about a person ization you got it okay okay great so yeah so let me get into the case studies itself so then when we talk about user experience we talk about all the elements which cater to user experience right right from your auto suggestion to
rep,your spell check in synonyms to your relevancy and gui and the personalization that and i've tried to find examples on all of those or that i found on your site right i start with auto suggest this is the current experience today right i look for so far probably look for office furniture essentially these are the options that i actually get when i look for it the good thing is it is guiding me in a specific
rep,way and there are a few visuals i could actually see which is a good thing a few suggestions here was a some of these things are repetitive these are probably synonyms that you have built at a back end but they also appear as options for an end user which is probably not the best experience those are some things that you could look at changing and then you could probably make it slightly more visual because you
rep,are selling lifestyle at the end of the day more visual aids will actually work even better a quick snapshot on what we have tried doing sorry so if you see the express side i'll take you to a few example just to give you a perspective see if you here go and try and find a product for jeans the way we have built our functionality is we've made it very personalized where first we take the customer through what's
rep,available in the inventory when you talk about jeans is a jeans for women jeans for men dean's of a specific style and then this is where we add personalization where we essentially do a geo segment because this is what express wanted because what sells in new york might not sell in san francisco so what they wanted us to do is essentially depending on where the user is coming in from show them specific styles designs
rep,of colors of that region this is most popular so we do a geo segment here and then we show all the popular queries and as you over around essentially the images change right this was the first experience we created and we also made it more personal that now if i change the query to dress right i change the query to address the we understand expressed does not carry dress for men so we only showed women and in dress
rep,probably the color might not be important but a specific style that would be more important so we show that right but i now change this to dress shirt then the men option comes back again right so this way this will change for every single query the intent here is as to how well you can actually personalize the experience for the end user so there's the whole intent we created
rep,this right and you've done this across all verticals like if you go to bed bad for them they have like close to 5 million skus including variances for them the intent is not exactly to show a more visual aids but to actually narrow down the customer to what he or she might be wanting so here if you start looking for a comforter right the way we've built the experience is to first guide them to what they might
rep,essentially want right and then once to actually hit enter and land enough landing page for the comforter we also help to show products we also show videos and they also show bikes and advance sisters with so that it's not just for product but it's also for content it works is a right and then if you go to a grocery space the way we have built in experience but then if we all buy egg milk in certain in each of
rep,our grocery run so the way we have created the experience is like the moment you start wanting to find a specific product you can actually change quantity and add products to cart right from the search experience so that it's much more easier to add products to cart because in grocery people might be buying twenty thirty products in every transaction so the reason i show you these examples is depending on your
rep,business use case they can customize the user experience and per slice it for any user might come on your site any questions on the so far no is this
prospect,other than is this something that integrates with adobe search and promote or is this something that is outside of
rep,it it can integrate with adobe search in product this is what you're seeing essentially with express of it this is essentially a javascript and ajax call it is making all we need is your catalog and you have to install our analytics on your site those only two things we need from you so that the machine learning understands how people are buying products on your site and your catalog gives us a perspective on what's
rep,available and what's not and we can essentially power just you auto suggest for your site okay right so that's one opportunity right and the second thing is for looked at was how do you manage error corrections today and i know adobe is probably not fully implemented as of now i tried misspelling a few single words most of them work because the inventory for single word back is small because
rep,you might be talking about just so far as in chairs and things like that so misspells do get corrected but when i go from more than a word is where i start seeing some challenges i look for a convertible sofa misspelled the word convertible and you have this as your part of your category pages but it's not sure convertible so fast to me i
prospect,okay i mean we know we haven't implemented it fully right now world we've implemented a version of search and promote in tandem with our current search technology so we're pulling in sp skus in our current first technology in the next couple of weeks we're going to be launching fully with just the adobe platform but to get us started and we had that we had to start kind of a little slower i understand
rep,no problem is why deliver probably once it's fully implemented it is correct but one of the logics we have tried building in since ours is a complete machine learning platform what we have done is as a fundamental it could be for any of a prodigious not just search it could be for our how do we power back category pages or how to be show product recommendations it has been made completely e-commerce context-aware
rep,we've essentially parsed the platform with over 200 million products so that it understands when somebody says blackly the sofa in a home-improvement space or a red cocktail dress in a parallel space or an 18-ounce 2% low-fat milk in a grocery space what does that exact context context look like and how do you have to resolve for each of those contexts so that's how relevancy has become a strongest suit and it covers
rep,all the three product lines we work with right and that's why if you go and misspell something as complicated as black leather jacket misspell all the three words incorrectly the system will automatically correct itself so you don't have to go and build a synonym for a spell check or a stemmed word on the platform more than nine percent use cases it's corrected out-of-the-box hence the name of actually and moves
rep,right and then again this was probably this will get corrected once sahabis fully implemented timing share with the space and without a space gives me two very very different results and you could go to our site like look at t-shirts as t-shirts d - shirts tee space shirts or tees you will see the same number of results as stage one and then secondly you will also see the products being displayed below are also
rep,the consistent products because in perspective the intent of the user is not changing so the result should also not change with me so far i am yeah great i the third thing and again this applies to all our product lines just not have to be searched even for a personalization product we guarantee a sub 300 millisecond response time with respect to where your user is across the globe today i see the search
rep,results at least are coming up a lot slower than i expected generally 300 to 500 milliseconds is what internet retailer recommends the great user experience today i saw the it was a lot slower and we've proven this even on black friday for all our customers like i just have included a snapshot for express a respect to very user in across the country everything will load within 300 milliseconds so
rep,that's nestle the people right now we're
prospect,i mean we we recognize that that's an issue on our on our side but we're running everything today through our internal servers so they're not cloud based they're behind our firewall they're behind our pipeline okay know that they're we know that it's slow which is one of the reasons we went to adobe search promote to get off of our internal system and get it into the
prospect,cloud so oh so we get some gains on the speed that absolutely makes sense and
rep,then i want to quickly touch upon relevancy and again in relevancy one of the things you might i know it's an opportunity that you've already started working with adobe but one of the things you would find issues with adobe is privately on any kind of natural language or context with such as being done on the site adobe works brilliantly for exact product names if people have an exact product in mind which you want
rep,to search for but when it comes to a specific theme it could be say cheap furniture or traditional furniture or if it is natural language when you're saying say love seat under five hundred dollars or something like that that's where the it's because adobe is not essentially a contextual engine it is great for these exact matches that's where you might see a few challenges and you might
rep,want to create some rules just a suggestion right somehow yeah we're
prospect,we're enough wearing the rule engine significantly at the moment trying to set trying to fix yeah
rep,and that's one thing we've tried avoided both for our search and a personalization product we try automating most of these experiences and i'll give you some examples of a purse lacing product just as soon as i finish this okay so some of the use cases i observed which you could consider looking at which one would like things like loveseat right like there are a different results for loveseat with a
rep,space in without a space and b not all these products are actually loveseat probably these are basic things that we should fix for you as soon as the inter platform goes like right then i look for brown leather sofa and then i actually trigger use the price sort filter right this is where i noticed another issue where i change the filter say from low to high or high to low the results get completely skewed so that is another
rep,thing that i noticed on the site yeah then is this is where like i'll show you the next few slides which is where you might see some challenges with adobe which is where probably you might have to go put your rules engine on that which is where you have a lot more theme based or natural language based queries like your two drawer nightstand you have to draw nightstands but it is not understanding the word the number two
rep,here it's essentially bringing up nightstands for me but not exactly what i want is use it right and then i look for traditional furniture and i looked at this as one of your top 50 keywords on google traditional furniture or leather ottoman not all their products are relevant here so that's another use case you might we just think about all right and then there was cheap furniture and kid bedroom sets again cheap
rep,furniture most of the results were incorrect but kids bedroom prep some of them relevant and some of them were not okay and this is where i just want to make a point even if you use adobe search and target one thing you might want to consider is just consider using us for relevancy and you can do an offline test to see if it makes sense or not just for relevancy we can still plug in with adobe and adobe does a bunch of
rep,other things as well apart from just core relevancy you could still consider plugging us for relevancy if at all you think in that direction so just i'm happy there a hint last slide i don't want to elaborate this too much look for an exact product name this was i think the 12th number 12 keyword on your organic search i did not find that i'm not sure if this particular product is out of inventory and then i look some
rep,non product searches i look for order status i look for dividend flanigan credit cards i essentially got me to those zero result pages which is the starting point out and let you know that this was a high level snapshot again i know there's a lot of work that is going on already in two months most of this could change but just on a point out to
prospect,you right now i appreciate it yeah we're aware of a lot of them but having obviously having other sides on the side as always it's always a good idea no
rep,problem and then then i already just show you a few snapshots of how we have solved it again you look for straight leg slim fit jeans you look for a skinny dress pant a you will not find too many results but you'll find the most accurate ones and then we can also go a step further this is where a contextual engine becomes in full steam you look for something at a full sleeve office wear for women or a black v-neck for
rep,women and are things like dress on sale and dress on clearance you will find exactly the right set of products and this is what we believe the user experience becomes extremely critical like non product things like return
prospect,shipping can you elaborate on can you go
rep,back to that you're previous slide so the
prospect,v-neck for women the black v-neck for women one of the things one of the things we've we recognized as an obstacle for us is that we don't necessarily have attribute values defined for our products so one of the struggles that we're having is most of the key terms we're picking up our from copy or
rep,the romance copy on the site so how do
prospect,guys how do you how do you find the information on black v-neck is it the product name is it entered an attribute value defined in the back system how how are you guys pulling that relevant out
rep,so we do three things one is we look at obviously your catalog and whatever is described in your catalog then we also parse the site for product descriptions because some of these products especially in home improvements we've seen have like ten lines written about every product especially if the product is expensive we get a lot of information from that and we also get a lot of information from your user reviews every
rep,product will have user reviews in most ecom sites and there will be a lot of content in that user reviews which could be relevant to the entire context of the search obviously there will be weights assigned to each one of them but by a combination of these three we have generally seen a relevancy will be much better okay right and just stepping back to this personalization right so a lot of these examples i
rep,showed you on a search all these apply for your personalization as well so this is primarily for your category page you might have a category for say leather so first right and you might be from new york i might be from san francisco and this is where personalization comes in where a we can do two things one is we can do one is to one personalization which is probably applicable to about 15-20 percent of your site this is where
rep,we know a lot of information about who you are you're probably a registered user your returning to the site to buy something else so we can really show the most appropriate product as much as the person might feel that the site is talking to him or her right that is one thing we could do the second thing for your bulk of your traffic where you don't know way too much information we
rep,do something called a segmented carpet right and today we do segmentation sigmod for right patients by geo with chile in build our old level but even with the new york somebody's staying in new york city in manhattan versus somebody the outskirts we can actually personalize it and this is this is where it becomes relevant probably if somebody is staying in manhattan if they are
rep,looking for a three seater so for the leather sofa the sofa that you have to show them as should be probably not the expansive ones because they might not have space to fit in that sofa but somebody who's living in the suburb might have a much bigger house much bigger living space and you would actually show them the bigger sofas right and then we can do segmentation by channel which is where it becomes more
rep,relevant because today you're spending tons of marketing dollars on sending them email campaigns doing ppc campaigns right and now when actually people click on that ppc campaign or click on that email when they land on your site what is that they see do they see the same products that you've sent them an email for or do you show them something different and how do you personalize that which is something that you could
rep,do with our segment and target - right and then what we've also noticed especially in the home improvement space the propensity of a user to buy i am talking in terms of the average order value the cart value dramatically increases with the frequency of visit when i come to your site for the first time and if i come with an intent to buy i might probably buy something which is say $250 right because i'm still testing
rep,your customer service i'm testing your site testing your brand but when i come to your site for the fifth time or the sixth time you can actually show me products which are much higher in value without compromising on the overall conversion rate because i i'm more likely to see and buy slightly more expensive product we call it as the pricing  insensitivity index and we essentially show products and target
rep,customers on top of that i'm just giving you a high level snapshot but these are multiple different things we could do just on your category page like to give you a high level example right say you go and look for jackets and you could be from new york and i could be from san francisco the first thing the platform will do is segmentation where it will essentially say ok this person is coming in from new york
rep,let's show them slightly thicker jackets because it's the month of feb it might still be cold but in san francisco show them slightly lighter jackets it is the first level segmentation but then beyond that is where personalization and machine learning will come into that you might have 15 thicker jackets to show so what do you show us product 1 what do you show as prod - and what do you show as product end is where all the
rep,analysis and all the machine learning data that we consume from your site will actually come into effect to show the most relevant product for the user and that is how we can come out and tell you and stick our neck out in a contract when we say we give you a 10% lift if you use this product because of all this personalization we can actually do for your customers that make sense i'm sorry i spoke a lot but i just wanted to get
rep,you the overall context of how we do it
prospect,ya know i makes a lot of sense so it sounds like to me that you guys really compete with the the adobe testing target or the adobe target tool like it's in its entirety that includes search and the test and target ad testing and personalization yes yes
rep,beautiful okay i'll show you a quick video of the personilization in dashboard because i think that give you more context of talking about c16 so because since you searched something you were already invested heavily on i just thought i'd show you the navigation just a browser experience video right all the segmentation logic is talking to you what is essentially what we do here say if you want to run a campaign for a
rep,specific category right so this is essentially what you could do you can go and you can start a campaign right and once you define a campaign you can choose the audience for that campaign right you can essentially define a start date end date to that campaign so that you can program your campaigns to start in a specific day and once you do this you can also choose the device that you want to target right you can choose that
rep,your should targeted a desktop or a laptop or a or both or you can choose to target a new user versus a repeat user you can choose to target specific geo or it confuse to target a specific channel and as you go along and selecting these options the one on the right side you would see essentially gives you the audience in the potential reach with this kind of a campaign that could actually reach out to right and
rep,once you do this then another thing that you notice this marketing teams might have conflicting ideas right some team might say we want to do something like idea a something something might have an idea b and you want to test this out on live traffic so you can essentially choose a bunch of these ideas and decide a winner by say a click rate or the conversion and actually do an a/b test on the live campaign say for the first
rep,six hours you can do an a/b test in the remaining 18 as in bandwidth whichever is actually one right once you do that then you can come in to your actual merchandising section where you can do all the things right you can slot them sort to pin them or boost it and all these are attributes that that can override the automated rule because you don't have to do anything of this on the dashboard and we'll still show relevant
rep,results on both your search and category pages but by doing this you can have greater control and you can do a bunch of custom rules like whenever somebody if i as a person aged 35 based out of san francisco come onto your site you can and look look at sofa such a category you can essentially tell configure rules here which would say the first three products should be my highest margin the next two products
rep,should be a which are on sale the next two products should be our new arrivals and you can essentially customize those loses accordingly as well and you can pin slot product specifically for those requirements okay and these are simple drag-and-drop features which would be easier for any merchandiser to create and run a campaign for i just thought i will show you this video that will give you a perspective on what we
rep,do so yeah and and then beyond this i'm not sure if you already started using somebody for product recommendations we also have that feature available almost everything that you see on amazon today is available with us it's all simple widgets again based on the same machine learning back in but again it can come out and show products to you all the viewed also viewed what also bought you might also like and we also have built
rep,some special widgets for apparel and home improvement in a parallel we'll build something but by the look in home improvement we call you to complete this set but you can name it the way you want but the essence is if i'm buying a three seater sofa you might also want to recommend the center table a specific table lamp or or a specific nightstand or a draw along with it to complete the set so that your
rep,average order value the marketing pieces and this is an complete automated experienced we at real time will pick up what products have been bought together or has been sold together or what product usually is a has a nice compatibility match and then show those products to do to your end users so it's more easier for that to do thank you
prospect,yeah our so did you say you were powering amazon's good no no we don't
rep,power amazon i think a by what i meant was everything that you see on amazon as recommendation which sets all those types are available with and works this way okay now amazon does not buy from anybody they built it on their own i
prospect,thought i was like a here all proprietary so so yeah this was a i know
rep,i had prepared a lot of slides on site search but i understand if you've already made a decision to go ahead with adobe but there are these few opportunities that we could look at if you're interested one is the auto sedation we could come in and power authorization for you and then there is this entire personalization but also come in and help and you could do an a/b test you can learn every test
rep,bit that will be and see which makes sense to you as well okay well i just is
prospect,for more transparency i mean we we are reap lat forming at the moment we're moving our or migrating or site over to the aem platform we haven't engaged with target yet okay so there's obviously there's still some opportunity there we had plans to integrate with target at some point because we recognize all of the value in personalization and relevancy but we're waiting on that until we get everything
prospect,into a am and can really start working in one environment so you know really looking at probably an eight month turn on getting the sites i grated over if we can maybe pick this conversation up you know in six months or so that would be that will probably be good timing sure
rep,and and we can probably if if the holiday season is a good period to test we are happy to integrate it and let you test it out on that three-month holiday period even if it is say five percent of your traffic so the ignition show you with live data as to how we could actually be different or we can help you you're the business for that section okay so what i'll do is i will never prepare
rep,this report i'll still forward you this use case study you could probably keep that as a reference pointer and and the we can reconnect probably if you don't talk for the next six months we probably will definitely forget us so probably if you have like want to pick up once in every two months just have a quick 15 20 minute conversation i could tell you what are the different new things that you have come out on the platform
rep,especially on the personalization piece what are you the most you've implemented this on and show you some live those cases and metrics at least we can keep the conversation in go in motion and then whenever you guys are ready probably september the proper time frame we could look at doing a quick test and and see how to pick it up from that all
prospect,right i think sighs okay okay so i will cover you this
rep,data and i will probably shoot for a first week of may kind of a time frame for another quick catch-up call so that we are in sync on what we do okay okay but again thank you so much thanks to all the transparency and they look forward to the opportunity any opportunity to work with place all right
prospect,i appreciate your time thank you
rep,have a segment in target 2 as well for both segmentation and western on both sides action so that's the whole gamut we cover of however this presentation are primarily prepared for site search most of the machine learning elements would remain the same and apply across all our products but i'm happy to spend time and talk about the other products as well to start i will give you a context that's not work for you were
rep,yeah ok so this was a quick high-level agenda i had prepared for today i want to spend a minute or two just to talk about who we are and what we do they would have done this have done a quick site search audit for the cheeki today and i've tried drawing some parallels with similar customers that we work so that you get an apples to apples comparison and then we can spock's stock specifics about the
rep,technology behind that we have the features on the product and some of the other verticals applicator to us right so that was a high level agenda so it's essentially taking about 4550 minutes to go through the entire deck but feel free to stop me if you have any questions before we get started i just had two quick questions i wanted to know which ecommerce platform you're on today and do you use
rep,anybody for site search or is it more built and solar we have homegrown solutions today okay water hunger okay good to know great so this is who we are as i told you we are in the bay area headquartered in mountain view we also have an office in chicago i'm an international operations in bangla a seven-year-old come clean work with about 120 of retail brands power about
rep,1200 global sites have success in every vertical we work with expression 21 just started working i'm taylor loft hsn the fashion in the marketplaces work with ip supply a b2b manufacturer or milwaukee work with us auto parts warehouse foreign container in the parts in our best base we work with integrating electronics first to tekken pharmacy actually that bathroom for improvement so it's kind of
rep,demonstrated our solution works pretty well irrespective of vertical vertical that may be with media and the solution is completely platform agnostic it could be a home run platform that you have today or even if you have to move to an enterprise platform it could be a tga or websphere - see you later distribution will have no impact we would not get impacted by just changing the platform so this is
rep,typically who we are any questions on this so far great so the one of the key roles that i play little company is a i talk to a lot of retailers like yourself and i also work very closely with my product team so that we're building the right set of feature set for all our private suite and for us search has always been a core component because probably 24 months ago a lot of retailers had probably between
rep,10 and 20 percent of your overall traffic on site search but today some of some of the retailers we work with have close to 50% or 60% of the traffic on search and what we've traditionally observed is a site search as a component is generally the conversions rate that sometimes 2x or even 3x the anomaly site search the site conversions so search essentially contributes to 50% of your business in most cases so search is an
rep,extremely critical component for every retailer today and our solution and our core relevancy strengths privately differentiates us from everybody else out there we are a sas platform but we do guarantee five nines of availability we have fronted by a cdn and we get into your sub 300 millisecond response time perspective resolutions across the country and the one differentiator which we have is because we understand
rep,especially on product discovery the needs are so different for every retailer because we might have worked with us other parts but what we've built for them might not be relevant to you our guercio businesses could be very unique and the behavior of your customers could also be very unique so we have a poc model where we could come in and implement this addition in the four to six weeks and then we let you
rep,use the product the remaining six weeks so that you see actually how the search performs for you and we guarantee you or ten percent lift in conversions within the first 90 days you see that lift in conversions you see that business impact you like working with our team and then you could continue with us for a contract or if you don't see the impact you can walk away no questions asked so this way you get to test the product
rep,before you actually buy it it starts out there and that's not fair i'm the confidence finally it comes from stacey david is because we've seen the success across every vertical enemy retailer we work with we see numbers as high as 50 60 % list in the search was very very bad or unin cases was people have worked immensely on search especially solo distances you still being able to demonstrate a fairly
rep,significant impact like what i could do is after this presentation and it also send you a case study that we prepared recently with id supply they roughly do about a hundred million dollars online they sort of milwaukee and some of the numbers there's something that you would talk to refer to a rapid automated call as to how we made it a first step so this is this would be approach that we take over simplification right so now
rep,let me get into some of these use cases and when i worked on these use cases have tried to mimic your customers behavior in terms of how do he or she actually finds products on your site what is the current experience today and what is that we could do differently so that i could present an opportunity snapshot for you okay and i start with autosuggest which is your first interaction with this system for any of
rep,the customers generally we want the auto success to be guided it should be visual it should try and mimic may experience a person might have in your store if you had a physical store when they go initially they want to go to a specific ie then they want to look at specific options they want to see products which are visual so that is what we try to create with some of our templates so today when i look at
rep,digital calm i do not see an artist best option right that is something that i thought was an opportunity for us to look at and i'll take you to some of these live sites so that you get some perspective on what we have built for some of our customers i try and stick to closer to your vertical at the same time i'll show you some of the options we have been for adelbert if this is where so that you get a depth of the
rep,customizations we could bring it right this is one customer parts warehouse again which was based roughly about 30 million dollars in online business they had a to specific behavior instances with their customers one was a customer who exactly move each partner to buy and another customer was somebody who did not know the part number to buy so before they came on to us they be with us for the last two years now two and a
rep,half years i guess so there - who / boxes one search box to find a part number in one search box for a modeling search but managing to search for instances became complicated the relevancy was queue so what we did is a we built them apart finder that you can essentially find any part of three clicks and from a search experience what we did is today if i pick up the first thing here the cell i start looking for
rep,the cell one side you would see parts from peggy whitson model names and then we sleep top searches for that specific way this was one of the instances period now if you move to an auto manufacturer these guys spend a lot of auto parts based in connecticut and for them if i start looking for say a mirror the way they have built an auto surrealist experiences they want to first identify which brand that you want a little far
rep,and then as you hovered around the essentially how products are made and it's actually add products to part right from the search box so that's another experience we've built for this retailer and if you go to a different vertical say closely the reason i thought i'd show this to you is with this you might also have people might come to your site just to buy it one product they might buy more
rep,than one product and inversely that there's a classic uses people generally like 3040 products mythical transaction so to buy a large limit of products you end up doing a lot of clicks a they wanted a quick active type option like the auto manufacturer shop and this is a large retailer they do about two religions and others in online the guru then a large distance south east asia and for them if i start looking for
rep,chicken of the way we've built the autos just experience for them is essentially you can change products quantity and add products to cart right from the search box we also post it where depending on your zip code you can actually show an offer for that zip code and then you can also see all the commonly searched terms a popular brands and categories any questions so far right and in the patterns we can actually up the level of
rep,personalization here for somebody they can express the variant things and experience for them i start looking for jeans as a product we have a guided navigation of jeans for women to use for men and as you hover around images change and then we can also have a segmentation block they are depending on the location that you're coming from whichever is the most popular color in the application we can also have
rep,different styles in that color and then the top keyword suspect so it's more visual and guided for the customer so these are some of the experiences we've built for some of the customers figure ok so the next experience i wanted to talk about was your ability to do error corrections in most instances especially if you've done something on soda or elasticsearch what you essentially end up doing is try
rep,and create a list of synonyms for most of you misspelled words or your stemmed words it could be even simple things like similar at google it works if you have a hundred products or a thousand products to sell but when you skew count becomes fairly large then it becomes a challenge one of the things we have done is census is it sad machine learning platform the baby of built a machine learning
rep,platform is we've actually trained at a common over 200 million products in the in commerce space whether it assigns the context of what people are looking for and then we've trained it on every vertical so the the machine learning platform knows that when somebody looks for a black leather jacket even a file space or an 18-ounce 2% nonfat milk in a grocery stays what does the exact context of the search means and it's
rep,being trained to autocorrect itself up to six words was spent in a single query but i just dropped the single letter or change the single-decker for a resistor of ithaca essentially none of the product showed up right you could cook like this is something with it would fly you should buy you will spend never know it was misspelled filter anything autocorrect and we'll also show you results from the word go and then
rep,similarly lit express you could butcher olive tree word black leather jacket as i suspected right here at lotto connected cells would lack exact minutes for your products and again you don't have to do this manually the system does it automatically for more than 99% of the cases all of this is solid out of box questions on this i don't know david you have questions on that one i mean it
rep,looks like in interesting auto-completion system have you done this with highly technical products like ours which you were there's a lot of part numbers and things like that we have actually david if you look at the us auto us auto actually has 2.4 million parent products parents queues and have a lot of variations to it so the overall products queue count that we're looking at with all the variances
rep,comes to about 180 million so we've managed to scale to that kind of volume and you have a lot of smaller sized retailers as well like bi because like i be supply has about 450000 skewers red bad has about 6000 scissors like technicals but i do supply some of the products can get a little technical and then this light container some of these are fairly technical instances and same
rep,with ss396 they also have a million parts that we deal with and and today i'm not sure if you're using elastic stress disorder is it manually updated for all these synonyms and spell checks there was a yeah no no today is the experience that you try to be like essentially for any spelling mistake you do this manually could you input all the variations finally we do do we do this manual
rep,you're asking yeah we don't have anything or complete do we say c no no not for automobile or spell checks david like in this example if i misspelled the world register so essentially unless you've built something like me there's no way to architect itself is that correct hey jc we do anything with stones no no no i don't think we do okay sorry bing bing was not to put you in a spot but
rep,it's fine if you don't know and another thing i want to talk about stacy david was even the stem website things like access sitting versus an accessories the results show a completely different because if but if you look at it as a user mankind does not change this was just one simple example it filled up but the intent here is i could spend anyway i want a like it could be a signaler water a few reload of things like wood
rep,wooden center central essentially the user intent is not changing so the experience that is show should also not change like i've tried using some snapshots like this wasn't a bad example but like t-shirt can be spent in so many different ways but the user intent is not changing so the results that we showed for those marching so this is again something that we automate and you don't have to do
rep,anything minded yama's that's another snapshot above the show and the third things was primarily from an infrastructure standpoint again as i told you since we fronted by the cdn we guarantee were sub create an oasis in response time and in a quick speed test on digi-key today i just wanted to search for a capacitor generally takes about five to six seconds for that search results page to load that is
rep,something that we could help you with because a vrs asked that form and be affronted by cdn and we've done this case for all our customers even under black friday it will load up within 300 milliseconds irrespective of where your user is across the country this is another benefit that we get with a cloud solution and lastly it's about relevancy again as the relevancy the core logics has been in me building out this machine
rep,learning platform and making it context aware to the ad commerce landscape and then another thing that we tried doing is also identify how people find products online today there are broadly about 12 ways people look for information in a site like yours people might be coming by an exact lot searching for an exact product name or a part number in say an apparel site people might be searching by a specific
rep,feature or the specific team say cocktail dresses or formal trousers in electronics we've seen people use a lot of linguistics oxford's like a 42 inch television the word inch could be replaced by double quotes for people today are so used to finding information on google's that we see a lot of natural language search if people might be looking for something on sale people might want to do some non product
rep,searches where they want to look at your returns policy shipping policy and they want them redirect to the right sections of website and then you don't have to do any of this manually our system automates most of these experiences it's not that we solved for the relevancy 100% but we know about 90% accurate for most of these use cases a man clayton do some of them as we build on right so
rep,these are some of the issues i found i'm used to some of the top keywords that i found at google like conversion calculator i did not see him insult i look for a register color code allocator i did not see any result i looked for a circuit diagram maker this is whether your documentation i did not find a dessert then i looked for some specific use cases where i know this is this is manufactured am i'm
rep,looking for a specific push-button switch but when i search for it it does not take them to that exact product page not it takes me to a page where it actually chose me located at these 10 15 things available it's doing a text back pneumatic pulling up everything was just loosely living to a switch or a push-button or a thermal zipang and it's giving me a large design set to review this is something that might impact
rep,customer experience on the site which is what if we could help you can i show you some news case with what we've done and and then i did a similar one i specifically looked for a dj international computer civil war probably this is this or something similar is what i wanted to look at but again i go i have to go to a large since i've said to narrow my search narrow my experience to the exact product i wanted
rep,this is one of the experiences stuff and then finally i looked for the slide potential we go you actually have a nice practically navigation where you show all these but when i search but it is where the issue is because you show me a bunch of other things then i have to click on this to actually get into this so these are some of the experiences i could see that can be optimized i'm pretty sure you're aware of all these or
rep,just totally see where the opportunity is for us and we come comments no they're very good examples man and i'm also too exciting business you've done a good job of doing homework thank you that's my dog but there what i'm doing that also taking some of the use cases we have signed for it it's easy to point issues with anybody site but it's not really if you go solve for it some of the things we've tried doing it try
rep,using some paddle examples like black logitech wireless keyboard i'll look for a very specific exact man as i look for a by they're sixteen point two ounce spray bottle right so for you to show the right results you have to understand the context of what the user is looking for and we do a fairly reasonable good job on that i'll show you four more examples right again this isn't a battle but the reason
rep,i show you this example is because it's so specific i'm specifically looking for the fullscreen office where for goodness so i should get into a category then it should looking for a specific theme and then it's looking for a specific product but it still shows up the right results so that's simply i want to show you here and then we also solve for part number matches pretty way you don't have to have the exact part number mention even
rep,a partial part number will give you options and while you're actually typing the part number it will actually start showing work in an auto suggests functionality it said so that you really don't have to go through a complete search experience to find the product and and we have a great indexing speed so indexing and relevancy is our core strengths we mix about 5000 products a second and we can consume a fairly large
rep,catalog and index time in the right way if i could ask what would be the potential cue count we could be looking at if we have to work with digital this is over medium skew sort of another minute schools i've know your part let's see what a million 5 million words okay that's a good number right and then some examples on on products such as the intent here is like if i click on return to click on of altars i click on order
rep,status i believe should redirect me to the exact page and that is what we do all these are automated redirects unless you want to override the magnet and then we also do compatibility searches just as an example and we also solve an active language things like some product on sale will also most cases give you the right results so the relevancy is a lot more context to that any questions on this so far yeah so another thing
rep,that i did notice obviously you have a lot of filters like one of the customers we work with i do supply for example the mid-segment space they have two four six thousand filters for four hundred thousand skews a we give you the ability to define faceting for every category even for an every subcategory a say for casual shoes you can define filter you can define attributes in the way you want then as a user that can come and
rep,search for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes make snide elements added eyes the results will appear in the same order of extra bution and then it's dynamic because if we figure that your ankle height is more clicked filter than size then ankle height automatically moves up on top you don't have to do this manually we can do this automatically all right similarly it works for casual shirts is right and
rep,then then finally on zero results pages the reason i put up this slide is to show the users some call to action instead of showing the sorry message with a blank page show them some recommendation widgets it could be recently viewed it could be your top sellers so that the user has some call to action to do instead of actually staring at a blank page so that was another suggestion i had any questions
rep,so far i'm great so and david is a quick reference document on how we do this from a technology standpoint these are the five things we do for every query that is inputted by a search box when i take you to what we're doing each of these things okay the first thing that we do is something for the semantic elements because to be
rep,essentially more such systems legal this problem where they're probably doing an ending what they're doing and having audio doing the middle match right the problem with this approach is that either you show too many products are you to show too few products or you probably show you another part and then we have to manually merchandising spraying is to actually solve it right so i've just taken an example i know it
rep,to be a paddle space but give you some context right so they're a query like women's white jeans this is essentially how would you show up because most systems use this rule called tf-idf which either gives your popularity's for a rarity score what we have done is we've added something called this usefulness for because it asked for tf idea if you look at this corset designs for women white and jeans it gives the
rep,maximum score to white then to women then to dreams but in the e-commerce context the opposite is true actually g this is the most popular this has to be given the maximum voltage then it should be women then it should be white right so we add something called as relevant screen of business or to all of the ideas for and hence we are able to start promoting products in the right way so we essentially displace products and
rep,bereaved in which are not relevant so that's the first stage that we do when we call it a semantic pelops i first idea is inverse inverse frequency yeah inverse document frequency okay so this is how you like google user since this was an algorithm which was great in the 70s even google uses to say algorithm but the problem is it's good for document search but it is not good for e-commerce search because in e-commerce
rep,the context to be very different like the example i told you here okay so this is the four step that we do right the second step but what we do is we saddling exclusions right again the top is not a jeans so we start excluding the top and decreasing back babies right once you do the states to the third then we start adding machine learning your behavior right so we were the first thing that we do when
rep,we start our implementation is to insert our analytics and we start reading through clickstream data so that we understand how how people are actually buying products in the site right so based on that creek stream data we come up with a product user behavior score and then we assign score for each product so that we go which product and actually most popular write the score as per this actual score a special market
rep,elements this product might have the maximum score but from clickstream data we realize that this product is the most popular since we essentially replace these products and then show them to a user right and then finally we also look for any merchandise that you might have done one distinct difference that we have against an end date or anybody else is when you do a apply a boosting rule it up which applies to the entire
rep,catalog what we do is we restrict the boosting rule for that query so that if you heavily booster products it does not show up in all the relevant places it only shows a particular category so that is something that we do and then finally we also add personalization to the entire behavior personalization is where we can start doing segmentation we can do segmentation by geo if your parts change for store location if stores is
rep,where you deliver the product from so you know you want to only show products which are actually available in literature you can actually do segmentation by geo then you can actually do segmentation by channel if you are actually spending money on your ppc campaigns and on your email campaigns you want to make sure that you also create something for people who are landing to your site from those
rep,campaigns so we help you to segmentation by geo right and we can also do segmentation by user type user versus completely sir what kind of products you want to show to them essentially six broad segments which we can help you target right and this is like a architecture we have built the entire platform on scene we were something act on the scene and essentially built all these four competence over the top of it
rep,which makes us very different from what people would have made using the solar or in lastik size interception and it's a lot of information that i expect out that this car giving you a quick context of how we do this any questions on this new with stacy that's for me the gauge is more the data science guy that ventura takes okay i hope you found it useful oh yeah i find your presentation very impressive you
rep,did a very very good job of pulling us together very impressively okay thank you sir and beyond this all these are automatic functionalities i spoke about but we also understand you understand your business better than us so we also have a back-end dashboard especially for your merchandising team and also for data science is seeing to actually come and look at reporting and we made it extremely comprehensive right
rep,this is a quick iv view of the dashboard this is where you can manage multiple subtotals you might have or if you have a different environment for scheduled for production in essence to manage everything from similar control this is essentially rated in go and set user exercise like what different peoples with different titles can actually see different sections on the dashboard and this gives you an executive summary so
rep,this issue or your number of search queries for product to use your application orders we have a dashboard similar to this like for our product recommendation also for a category navigation as well and then this gives you a high level metrics and then you can go and game down in fairly comprehensive reporting in the search dashboard you can go and look for reporting on search and also for your
rep,auto computers file and this gives the first section gives you high level report so i must cite as a little internet a little slow to get over that so this gives you a high overview this you can look at all your search heads you can compare it with any metric you want to and it gives you the top metrics which is your top search queries as you know results you click products the order
rep,products all this can be downloaded into a csv and can be reviewed and then we do get semi we also give you individual query reporting where you can actually go and drill down the every single query on your site and see how each query is performing like if dress is an important way to here you can now go down by and drill down to the screen address look at all the business metrics associated with this query and then see how is this
rep,query performing of the products associated to that so this week if this grading is doing three point two six percent conversion and last series were actually doing clear was probably doing four percent you can now go and see which are the products and order of inventory because of which the performance of this query drop like we have done this for the query you can on our category dashboard you can also do
rep,it for every silly cada cristal any questions on this and then you can also look at similar reports for your auto finish well here in feature your keyword suggestion your top queries popular products however you constructed it it is a new matrix on all the autosuggest option suspend right and then finally we have a merchandising dashboard this is like if your mercenaries have used a make i experience panther it has all the
rep,functionalities for endeca experience manager but is probably 100 less complicated than that it's more of a creamy 17 dashboard right i have a quick video which i can do which i think will do more justice to this just play that video so it's more easier and covers all the sections listen - pork you can go and create custom landing pages you can create the
rep,campaigns a little that you want to do but every query in every category is red you can define a campaign you can have a specific start date and end date for any campaign you will create and once you've created that you can go ahead and start defining an audience for that campaign right in this audience is where i spoke about the segmentation you can specifically create a campaign for your users for your users you can create a
rep,campaign for a specific device type people are coming in from your desktop versus mobile you can clear the campaign for people coming from a specific geography today you can actually go and drill down by a trip code and you can also create a campaign for a specific channel right and then as you start selecting your segmentation budget it will also give you an indicator as to what's the potential reach of this
rep,campaign okay and once you've chosen your audience a different marketing teams might have different ideas so what we've also done is built an a/b test feature within the dashboard where if team a has idea a and pb has idea b they can essentially test do one live a b test and decide the winner by say clicks or conversions whatever metric you want to follow so so that you're more certain as to what
rep,actually make friends leaders and once you've defined all this now you can go into merchandise you can do boosting you can do slaughter you can do sorting or you can do pinning and again all of them can be a simple drag drop feature and as you keep creating the rules it will start showing your preview of all the actions you are actually taking on the dashboard and then you can essentially review that before you actually go ahead
rep,and publish it i'm sorry information order but i just wanted to cover all the elements of - stacy do you have a specific tool that you've built in-house to manage moulton items today well our please we use sitecore for our few pages and so we're just getting started using their personalization i think our biggest differentiator from most of the other partners of that is because we do product discovery and
rep,claim we also help you with site search we can help you with product recommendations we can power your category pages and we have a most amaz'n dashboard so that it's much easier for you to essentially run everything with the same vendor but again you can also use it other cart you can still use assist for search and use somebody else for any other things so they're both the options available so yeah this was a
rep,quick snapshot on the merchandising dashboard any questions on this so far this was like a high-level tour of the entire product so this one will stop and tell me questions and then get into the implementation you and they would say feel pricing is based on the number of search sessions if you just look at a search product and it is
rep,basically overall side sessions if you look at the end gap product discovery product line that we're talking about okay and as i told you we have a poc model you don't have to see give us any commitment till you actually see that as a new optics we can come in i discuss about the implementation approaches as really we could come in and integrate the solution in four to six weeks and then generally we keep it a very low
rep,cost for the poc usually under ten thousand dollars so that you and this is primarily reaction costing is in current integration and you could test the product of the cream and see if it'll make sense and as i told you we guarantee you a ten percent of technical version so you don't see that uptick you can walk away no questions asked do you actually i mean do you send the presentation to us at all yes absolutely
rep,that would be great because i think the piece here that important from us you know i would need to share with our it team and i'll also send you an implementation of those documents we can do implementation in two ways with us today you're using soda or elasticsearch we can mimic the same response that the solar is given today of your application or alaskan cells is giving to your application so that it will be a very
rep,simple integration it's a simple api that will build a need to do the api is enough to just manipulate that or we can also do an in page ajax end of a model where you create a page give us your header footer and an empty div tag and we can do html injection and we can build all the conflicts on our end so in the spectacles in each of these cases either of these cases actually we can go live in four weeks
rep,and then you would have two months to test the product out to see if you're actually getting a business impact part of this just a quick question facing in terms of how do us in planned out to you guys is there a window available for us to do a poc this year i don't know that would be something i would need to talk to it with okay again as i told you the intent is to involve as little of your time as possible
rep,we can technically if especially if you choose the impetus ax approach all we need from you is your cat law about an hour of your developers time to install our analytics and then once the entire configure business put in a stadium platform a few days of your developers time to do testing that's about it we will do all the work at adam and then you can either do an a/b test just to see a side-by-side comparison you can
rep,push 50% of your traffic on your existing infrastructure and the remaining 50% one in box and and see if we are at least 10 percent better at a minimum compared to your existing system so you can actually do that did a very nice presentation i liked it used our site for example ok thank you so much and do you want us to schedule a follow-up call in about a week or two weeks to discuss if there is
rep,a feasibility for us to do a poc in the next quarter or the third quarter of the year do you think that's okay i would say for me i david and i should probably have a conversation first i should probably share that document with somebody for my tea and so i think i wouldn't set anything up yet okay you're welcome to check back with us say it and i would give it three weeks because i know myself i'm
rep,traveling the next two weeks okay would you be in shoptalk by any chance no no i'm going to florida and then i'm just traveling here in minnesota okay nobody's so yeah i know i'll just send you all the information end of day today you could take a look at it feel free to ping us if you have any questions i'm going to really wait for the next steps from you good okay again thank you both for your time and
rep,have a great weekend ahead you kill excellent presentation thank you you're welcome
rep,good morning and welcome to a special edition of this week one on one with the commander in chief at this defining.
prospect,moment of the obama presidency this is not a world we should accept this is what the distinction with a crisis.
rep,overseas new showdowns with congress here at home we go inside the white house challenging a president trying to.
prospect,save his second term and stop a war one-on-one with president obama you've done in the pen no no no george and abc.
prospect,news exclusive plus live analysis from our powerhouse roundtable it's all right here this sunday morning from abc news a special this week with george.
rep,stephanopoulos starts now it has been a perilous month for president obama after that chemical.
rep,weapons massacre in syria he took america right to the brink of a military strike then backed away turning to congress first and surprisingly the russians choosing diplomacy over war and.
prospect,this weekend a major new development secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart have struck a deal for syria to surrender its chemical weapons if it works and that's a big if.
prospect,right now the president may be able to claim a measure of victory for an approach that's brought him a mountain of criticism and on the eve of the deal we went inside the white house to speak.
rep,with the president he was confident convinced that america is in a better position now than when he was poised to order military action just two weeks ago.
rep,we're definitely that's a better position but keep in mind that my entire goal throughout this exercise is to make sure that what happened on august 21st does not happen again that we do not see over a thousand people over 400 children.
prospect,subjected to poison gas something that is a violation of international law and is a violation and that won't happen occasionally well i think we have the possibility of making sure that it doesn't happen again think about where we work this event.
prospect,happens and the initial response is the syrians act as if they don't know anything about it at that point they're not even acknowledging that they've got chemical weapons the russians are protecting the syrians suggesting that.
rep,there's no possibility that the assad regime might have done this and the inspectors weren't even in yet and as a consequence of the pressure that we've applied over the last couple of weeks we.
rep,have serious for the first time acknowledging that it has chemical weapons agreeing to join the convention that prohibits the use of chemical weapons and the russians their primary.
rep,sponsors saying that they will push syria to get all of their chemical weapons out the distance that we've traveled over these couple of weeks is remarkable in my position and the united states position has been consistent.
rep,throughout we is that the underlying civil conflict in syria is terrible i believe that because of assad's actions his response to peaceful protest we've created a civil war in syria that has led to a hundred.
rep,thousand people being killed and six million people being displaced but what i've also said is that the united states can't get in the middle of somebody else's civil war we're not going to put troops on the ground we can't enforce.
prospect,militarily a settlement there but instead he had to go what we can do what we can do is make sure that the worst weapons the indiscriminate weapons that don't distinguish between a soldier and an infant are not used and if we get that accomplished then we may also have a foundation to begin what has to be an.
prospect,international process in which assad sponsors primarily iran and russia recognized that this is terrible for the syrian people and they are willing to.
prospect,come in a serious way to arrive at some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict and president putin's become.
rep,you're unlikely partner in this and you.
rep,know even in this outfit which is sort of a lot of controversy here in the.
rep,united states he said there's every reason to believe that the rebels are the ones who use the chemical weapon so does that tell you.
prospect,he's willing to lie to protect assad well nobody around the world takes seriously the idea that the rebels were.
prospect,the perpetrators devoting their time well i understand what i said there's nobody around the world takes seriously.
rep,the idea that the rebels perpetrated this attack now what is true is that there are radical elements in the.
rep,opposition including folks who are affiliated with al qaeda who if they got their hands on chemical weapons would have no compunction using them in syria.
rep,or outside of syria and part of the reason why we've been so concerned about this chemical weapons issue is because we don't want those folks getting.
rep,chemical weapons any more than we want assad to have chemical weapons and so the best solution is for us to get them out of there but with.
prospect,respect to mr.
prospect,putin i have said consistently that where the interest of the united states and russia converged we need to work together and i've talked.
rep,to mr.
rep,putin a year ago saying to him the united states and russia should work together to deal with these chemical.
prospect,weapons stockpiles and to work to try to bring about a political transition has her same goal do you really tell that i don't think that mr.
prospect,putin has the same values that.
rep,we do and i think obviously by protecting mr.
rep,assad he has a different attitude about the assad regime but what i've also said to him directly is that.
prospect,we both have an interest in preventing chaos we both have an interest in preventing terrorism the situation in syria right now is untenable as long as.
prospect,mr.
prospect,assad is in power there is going to be some sort of conflict there and that we should work together to try to find a way in which the interests of all the.
rep,parties inside of syria the alaa whites the sunnis the christians that everybody is represented and that there is a way of bringing the temperature down so that.
rep,the horrible things that are happening inside the country or containing the hammond i think there is a way for mr.
prospect,putin despite me and him having a whole.
prospect,lot of differences to play an important role in that and so i welcome him being involved i welcome him saying i will take responsibility for pushing my.
rep,client the assad regime to deal with these chemical weapons because i think that if in fact not only russia gets involved but if potentially iran gets involved as well in recognizing that.
rep,what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just syrians but destabilize i shall read all the putin's being on time and playing you well you.
rep,know ronald reagan said trust but verify and i think that that's always been the experience of us presidents when we're interacting with four soviet leaders and.
rep,now russian leaders mr.
prospect,putin and i have strong disagreements on all range of issues but i can talk to him we have worked.
prospect,together on important issues the fact the matter is is that we couldn't be supplying all of our troops in afghanistan if he weren't helping us in transporting those supplies through the.
rep,northern border northern borders of afghanistan so there are a whole range of areas where we currently work together we've worked together on counterterrorism operations and so you.
rep,know this is not the cold war this is not a contest between the united states and russia i mean the fact of the matter is is that if russia wants to have some.
rep,influence in syria post-assad that doesn't hurt our interests i know that sometimes this gets framed or looked at through the lens of the us versus russia but that's not what this is about what.
rep,this is about is how do we make sure that we don't have the worst weapons in.
rep,the hands either of a murderous regime or in the alternative some elements of the opposition that are as opposed to.
prospect,the united states as they are to assad this weekend after intense talks the us and russia hammered down a deal providing this framework is fully implemented it can end the threat these.
prospect,weapons pose not only to the syrian people but also to their neighbors to the region it calls for syria to admit.
rep,international inspectors by november and to allow its chemical weapons to be destroyed starting next year but.
rep,president assad has not yet endorsed a deal and the rebels fighting his regime fear it will empower him if one year from now assad is in the process of.
rep,surrendering his chemical weapons but he strengthened his hold on power is that a victory well the chemical weapons issue is the issue i'm concerned about first.
prospect,and foremost simply because that speaks directly to us interests it speaks to the potential that other countries start.
prospect,producing more chemical weapons that the ban on chemical weapons unravels and it becomes more accessible to terrorists which in turn could be you.
prospect,against us so i have a primary concern there i also believe that the us has an interest in seeing a stable syria in.
rep,which people aren't being slaughtered and it is hard to envision how mr.
rep,assad regains any kind of legitimacy after.
rep,he's gassed or his military has gassed innocent civilians and children and so part of my argument here is that we will.
rep,not intervene militarily to bring that transition about but all the countries in the region and i think the entire world and the united nations should have.
rep,an interest in trying to bring about that stability what do you think it ron makes of all this you mentioned iran do you think they can look at all this and.
prospect,say maybe all options aren't on the table you're not willing to use force no i think i think the iranians who we communicate with in indirect ways have.
prospect,you reached out personally the new president i have and and he's reached out to me we haven't spoken directly but letters.
rep,yeah and i think what the iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue that the threat.
rep,against iran against israel that nuclear iran poses is much closer to our core interests that a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be.
rep,profoundly destabilizing and so i my suspicion is that the iranians recognized they shouldn't draw a lesson.
prospect,that we hadn't struck to think we won't strike a run on the other hand what it what they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of.
prospect,resolving these issues diplomatically there's anything they believe that i think they recognize in part because of.
rep,the extraordinary sanctions that we placed on them that the world community is united when it comes to wanting to.
rep,prevent a nuclear arms race in the region and you know negotiations with the iranians is always difficult i think this new president is not going to suddenly make.
rep,it easy but my view is that if you have both a credible threat of force combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort that in fact you can you can strike a deal.
rep,and i and i hold out i hold out that hope final foreign policy questions had some month a lot of armchair criticism i'm sure you're used to that i am.
prospect,senator corker foreign relations committee said you're not comfortable as commander in chief it's like watching a person who's caged the president of.
prospect,counsel foreign relations richard haass words like ad-hoc improvised unsteady come to mind this is probably the most undisciplined stretch of foreign policy.
rep,in your presidency what do you make of that well you know i i think that folks here in washington like to grade on style and so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear.
rep,they would have graded it well even if it was a disastrous policy we know that because that's exactly how they graded the iraq war until sitting in our.
prospect,president bush not know what would what it says is that i'm less concerned about style points i'm much more concerned about getting the policy right and what.
prospect,i've said consistently throughout is that the chemical weapons issue is a problem i want that problem dealt with and as a consequence of the steps that.
rep,we've taken over the last two weeks to three weeks we now have a situation in which syria has acknowledged it as chemical weapons has said it's willing.
rep,to join the convention on chemical weapons and russia its primary sponsor has said that it will pressure syria to reach that agreement that's my goal and if that goal is achieved then it sounds to me like we did something right.
prospect,and we have much more from president obama all the challenges here at home when we come back.
rep,got it
prospect,we use a different system for sending push notification in our mobile application they have another different system for sending push notification on desktops.
rep,got it.
prospect,we have a local sms panel for sending sms and what else transactional emails that we are sending.
rep,so all of these all of these engagement channels are separate as of now.?
prospect,they are yeah.
rep,they are separate they don't they don't.
prospect,there is not a story for truely yet they're not really integrated so we're using different platforms for different purpose.
rep,makes sense perfect and how did you come across web engage if i may know.
prospect,yeah we we are really interested to experiment with marketing automations and this sort of real clever style of marketing and engagement no type of company and we really think that this sort of technologies could help us engage and retain our customers much more efficiently.
rep,great.. glad to hear that perfect all right um i'll just give you a brief of what web engage is.. we are a marketing automation suite wherein we help you engage and retain your customers addressing you know funnel drop-offs across customer life cycles throughout throughout their journey on your platforms ok this the the usp of our our particular platform is we currently how you are running your engagement strategy in silos we allow you to stitch or seamlessly integrate these these particular engagement channels together and create a workflow where in all of these channels speak to each other that is if you are sending an email and you want to you want to reach out to this user that if he does not open an email in two days you want to follow it up with a push notification and if he does not open or does not click on the push notification you want to follow it up with an sms automatically this is possible using web engage.
prospect,we are aware of the some of the general features and how the whole system works what we are interested is lot more details about the specific features and that sort of stuff.
rep,absolutely .. so i will walk you through the entire dashboard now i'll share my screen with you like great once you can see it.
prospect,nothing yet.
rep,just a second.
prospect,yes.
rep,all right great.. so this is this is web engage dashboard we i will walk you through a ecommerce account which is a dummy account with some data in it so that you can see how it would look in real time like how would the real data look like on the dashboard.. for web engage everything is a subset of user data for us it is very important to understand what your users are doing on your platform so that we can engage them with very contextual and personalized communication all right.
prospect,your voice is breaking now that you have shared this screen.. have you ever had a of ___ i'll send you like and then ___.
rep,sure.. appear in.. okay okay you want me to join the.
prospect,because i don't know whether i guess that would have a better speed for us.
rep,okay okay.. skype  skype because the screen sharing doesn't work in that.. .
rep,are you sure screen sharing would work well in appear in.
prospect,yes yeah it does work well.
rep,okay.. let me let me connect then.
prospect,thanks for now.. okay can you hear us now.
rep,yes yes i can hear you loud and clear.
prospect,an extension for your chrome or. firefox to be able to start the screen sharing.
rep,alright.. can you see my screen.. now.
rep,saman can you can you see my screen.
rep,hello.. saman are you there.
prospect,yes yeah and i can see your screen .
rep,alright.. shall we proceed ahead now.
prospect,yes please.. go ahead.
rep,perfect.. perfect.. so as i was explaining web engage for web engage all the data that we collect is is a subset of the user activity and the user information that we get from your platform.
prospect,okay.. and by by by the platform you mean web and.
rep,web and app yeah.. web and app yes so so you can see on the left in the inside section there are three subsections - users events and segments.
rep,all right so all the user information that we track which is once a user logs in or once a user makes a payment on your platform that you can pass some information to web engage like user contact information so that you can reach out to them on email and sms and engage them alright so in the users.
prospect,which is on based on events.
rep,yes.. hello saman are you there.
prospect,yeah yeah then you track the user like page view and that sort of things.
rep,absolutely absolutely.
prospect,do we have to pass the page view as an event or does it automatically track the page views.
rep,no so you have to pass  you have to define events initially during the integration phase and then later on we we automatically understand when the user has viewed which page what product he is added what product he is seen and so on so during the integration phase we we help you plot the event which would be used on your platform basis which you want to track your user activity yes.
rep,so coming to users so here you can see on the overview screen you can see the new users you've added on your platform in the last seven days here and your daily weekly monthly active user count these are all unique users that you see all right then coming in the user section you will see all the user information what the user has done so this is this is your contact list these are the users who have logged in or made a purchase on your site okay and if you click on any one of these user profiles you will be able to see the complete user history you know user name user email the phone number whatever they have provided to you and you have.
prospect,___ profiles then yeah ok.
rep,yeah so here you can see the first name last name in case this is something you're collecting you can pass it to us and then comes user id email location user since and last seen these three attributes are tracked by our sdk on its own yeah contact number and email id is something that you pass to us okay so whenever the user logs in you get this information.
prospect,do you track the users through anonymous id as well.
rep,yes yes we do we we track their activity so for example if i once web engage is integrated on your platform and anonymous users who have not logged in they land on your platform they view some products they add something is the cart we will know that there is some user who's doing this but we would not be able to engage them on emails and smss is because we don't have that information yet with us but you would be able to reach out to them on channels which do not require personal information like browser push notifications on site pop-ups.
prospect,pop-up notification?.
rep,yeah.. yeah then coming to attributes these are our user attributes in your system which are not present on your website readily.. example would be total number of times user has purchased on your platform if that is something you are keeping a track of and based on that if you want to segment your users you can you can very easily do that by passing this as a user attribute.
rep,so whatever you pass to us we make it available to you in the segmentation piece allowing you to filter your users based on this particular criteria.
rep,all right.
prospect,is there any limit to the number of attributions we can have.
rep,attributes no.. so there is a limit the the so we support four kinds of data type one is string number boolean and date these are the four data types all right we allow you to define 25 attributes of each data type okay.
prospect,sorry what what was the data types?.
prospect,it was date.
rep,date number string and boolean that is true or false.
rep,so this is the limit we've never come across clients who require more number of attributes but in case that is an issue we can look at you know customizing something.. in case more number of attributes are required for any particular datatype but that we have still not encountered such a case.
prospect,ok.
prospect,and we can always use the api function in your user journies  to get more information through api as well.
rep,absolutely absolutely you you seem to have checked our journey designer videos and documents i think.
prospect,yes yeah i've seen some of them.
rep,that's that's great so yes you can you can definitely in real time you can you can fetch any information from your system via api calls and use it to personalize the communication that is being sent out.
rep,all right coming back to this particular section here on the right you can see activity here you can see what the user has done in his past sessions on your platform all right so whatever.
prospect,these are the events that we are we are.
rep,absolutely correct.
prospect,oh yeah.
rep,yes so now if i click on this event i will know what particular product he has seen here selected and so on.
prospect,and pageviews have to be ___  pageviews need to be event yeah?.
rep,i'm sorry summon there was some lag can you repeat that again.
prospect,yeah i mean page views and screen views needs to be defined as an event in this platform is that right?.
rep,yes yes you're correct.. so there are there are two two aspects.. it is always recommended to define it as an event so that you can have very granular seg- so because you have granular segmentation available because once you pass events you can you can create a segment when i go to segments it will be much more clearer but you can create a very granular segment where you can filter using these attributes that you are passing okay.
rep,and if you do not define a let's say if there are no event defined on your site you can then target based on the number of pages viewed or the number of time the user has spent on the site and so on so which is which is not very you won't be able to target users based on the behavior as such it would only be based on the pages viewed the time users spend and stuff but with events you can pinpoint you know specific categories that you want to target if a user has seen a category which has some deal on it or something like that so you can you know immediately show them something via some of the channels like email or you know pop-ups or browser pushes and so on.
rep,so we always.
prospect,can you can you give us 20 seconds to just just ___ discussion.
rep,absolutely yeah no problem.. yeah thanks for waiting.. all right shall we proceed. yes please all right.
prospect,yes please
rep,alright. great. now at the bottom the last section that you see is device section where you can tell you what particular device or what particular platform the user is accessing or using your your platform on so here if it is android which it means that the user is on your app he is an app user similarly if he is using a website you will see a separate section here called website with similar information when did he first login on the web side and what particular browser he is using and so on so this information as well that you see here the device information this also can be used for segmentation.
rep,all right.. now coming to events these are some generic ecommerce events that you can see.
rep,ok this is just an example the list can be pretty exhaustive based on what you want to what you want to track on your platform you will have some events that you define the list the number can be as big as you want depending on how you are tracking your user activity so here you can say 9 it can be ninety nine hundred anything.
prospect,yeah but your but your pricing based on number of number of attributes right.
rep,yeah yeah our pricing is based on monthly active users.
prospect,monthly active users only.
rep,yes yes that's.
prospect,doesn't matter how muc-.
rep,so so there is a soft limit on the event volume but it is it has never been an issue because we we provide some almost 30x volume in terms of.
prospect,30x number of active i mean 30 events per user.
rep,yeah yeah so based on the slab in which you fall we provide almost 30x events per user yeah.. now coming to segments now whatever you saw in users and events section this is all data which we allow you to use to create different buckets of filters in segments section.
rep,so here you can see cart abandoners for the last 30 days highly active users in last seven days etc so these are different kinds of segments that users have created similarly you create a new segment so there are three sections in segmentation - users behavioral and technology.. in user section you can specify what are the kind of users you want to target all users only the new users or users based on the number of sessions so here you get operators.
prospect,what does a new user mean?.
rep,a new user means a user so we we for definition of a new user for us is a user who is on your platform and it is his first session.
rep,okay any any user with more than first session is a returning user and you can also target them based on the number of sessions.
prospect,ok cool.
rep,alright last seen is another property which you can use so i can say users who were last seen before and you get an option last and you can specify whether you wanna target users who were last seen before last two hours days weeks months okay.. you can also target users based on their location so we have geo filtering and then.
prospect,do you i mean specifically pass user location.
rep,you can pass user location if you specifically pass it then it would be listed as a user attribute here.
rep,okay so you see in the system part it would be listed as city okay and if you do not pass it we any which ways crack ip addresses based on which we track their geolocation.
prospect,there's ip location too so that trigger.
rep,yes yes so all the user attributes that you're passing you can use them here so a user attribute can be total number of times the user has purchased on your platform so you can specify that you want to run a campaign our users were purchased more than five times on your platform or who have purchased in between zero and five times all right.
prospect,the __ segment based on like your geo friends or like a polygon on a map or something if you pass the user location based on their as a property.
rep,so you cannot segment them basis that but you can run campaigns basis that particular feature so that is the part of our push notification.
rep,okay so.. any any user entering.
prospect,___.. yeah so we won't be able to use this feature like.
rep,for segments it cannot be done because users with they would they would in segmentation you're saying that you want a geofencing feature correct.
rep,yeah so geofencing is right now only available as a part of individual campaign not a part of segmentation as of now because it is not applicable across channels because web notifications would not use geofencing nor would emails and smss  so yeah.
rep,so i would i would come to that i'll explain to you how you can use that particular feature okay.
prospect,sure thank you.
rep,sure.. coming back to segmentation you can also target users based on their acquisition source in case you are running or your acquiring users through paid ads google paid ads or through affiliate sites or through email campaigns you can specify them here you can say i want to run a particular campaign only for users whom you have acquired through emails or through.
prospect,is it from utms or can you integrate with other attribution systems like adjust and that sort of stuff.
rep,yeah we can integrate with other systems as well and you can target them based on utm parameters as well so in case it is utm parameters then you select any channel and in the referral url you select contains and you just specify the utm parameter here.
rep,all right so this is based on acquisition source you can filter users so this was user section in segmentation now coming to behaviors this is where you will play around with most of the permutation combinations and you will create very filtered segments so any any user landing on your site would be a part of your funnel okay so first would be users who have let's say signed up successfully and who have not yet made a purchase all right.. signed up successfully not yet made a purchase or you can sign up successfully but not yet added anything to the cart okay or you can say added to cart but not completed checkout now in add to cart you can add a filter where whatever product is added to the cart its attributes will be listed here so i can say a model or category is equal to and whatever other product categories listed on the site would be available in this drop-down here.
prospect,okay just one quick question here.
rep,yes.
prospect,these these segmentations are going to be dynamic.
prospect,so the users would be part of this the segments and they must not be segments in document.
rep,yes yes users will keep moving in and out of segmentation yes.
prospect,exactly so how how often does this segmentation get supplied and how real time can we can we use this segmentation.
rep,so.
prospect,you know what i mean for example we have food delivery platform if you want to segment the users who have added food to their platform but they added somethings like black ___ but it's really time-sensitive so if you are too late in finding these users they have probably find their food somewhere else.
rep,sure.. so hi saman this is a nilay here just wanted to answer this one.. so i'll give you an example so first of all the answer to the question is extremely real-time all right and every time like you kind of visit the segment page and you see a data for the users falling in that segment it'll refresh real-time and every time you'll see the new new new set of users entering and exiting so it's extremely real time number one.. let me also mention to the scale that we are doing this at.. all right so let me name one of the biggest e-com players in india is goes by the name of flipkart i am not too sure - you've heard about them.
prospect,i'm aware.
rep,that's one one of the biggest clients that we have in india for us all right and and and and i'm talking about a scale of a couple of millions of users coming on to the platform every day.
rep,all right that's the scale a on that scale this not only gets refreshed at the right real time at that moment but your data inside the personalization template which gets posted as events and attributes also replenishes and changes itself as per the users falling in the segment and the triggering also happens at real time so it's not just about the segment data falling into segmented terms of the users moving in and out but the templating engine real-time on top of it which is deeper segmentation and the triggering in terms of if any attribute changes and you have to trigger something in terms of an email sms or in terms of overlays or any push browser push notifications or app based push notifications that will also happen in real time hence what i'm trying to sum up at is ___  i am supposed to be an automation engine which means once you've created a segment you attached a campaign to it and you've defined a point of trigger all right whatever that might be all of these activities for that particular journey or the user case will happen automatically on its own you just have to sit down and look at the analytics of the campaign happening make tweaks as and when you choose to proactively.
prospect,yeah great.
rep,i hope that answers my your question.
prospect,yeah.. excellent.
rep,great great moving ahead so this particular piece here in segmentation you can create very granular filters very granular segment of users based on these this particular filter feature so you can add multiple filters and you can specify and or or functionality here.
prospect,see __.
rep,this was behavioral coming to technology here you can specify if you want to target a particular android device or you know let's say users who are on a previous version of their app you want to reach out to them.
prospect,to send a push notification.
rep,yeah so or based on the app installation date you want to send some pushes or based on the last seen and so on.
rep,alright so this is android and ios both are both have the same properties here all right and then we have the web where you can specify if you want to target a particular device that is if you want to show campaigns only on mobile device that is mobile desktop or you want to show it on your desktop website or you want to show it on all three so yeah.
prospect,by mobile desktops you mean laptops and - .
rep,so mobile mobile website.
prospect,a mobile website so yeah.
rep,all right so this was segmentation now once you created a segment you can choose any of these six channels here to engage your users push notifications in apps smss on site that is on your website we have overlays that is pop-ups where you can engage users using notifications take user feedback using surveys and a feedback form where users can so this is a feedback form here that you can see on the right you can call it support you can call it helpdesk or feedback and users who want to who have some queries like they want to reach out to you they can click on this particular button and they can fill the form and submit you can this form is completely customizable just like all our other channels on the in the on side piece.. so in notifications also you can create pop-ups with you know you can customize them add images add background colors and so on okay.. now coming to push notifications you.
prospect,one question here how right-to-left friendly is your a platform so our language version is a rtl sort of language.
prospect,how friendly is your platform for those languages.
rep,so you can you can copy paste the text in any of any of the channels and it will work as as intended there is no problem with with any of the channels of engagement we we are currently engaging customers in the middle east where they constantly send out these kind of messages they use the arabic language which is also from with like which an rtl language and they use our platform for sending out push notifications on-site campaigns in the arabic piece.
prospect,on what platforms ____.
rep,let me let me let me show this to you this is nilay here let me just quickly show you an example of the notification that manpreet is talking about is there a way we can show this to him.
prospect,i know notifications are going to be fine because this just simply text or even better the these things.
prospect,but but but the platforms or pop-ups and this this type of notifications how how customizable they are.
rep,let me let me just give me a minute.. just let me fetch a few examples for you.. that'll make sense for you guys.
prospect,that'll make it more clear for us.
rep,yeah just a sec.
rep,while while manpreet is searching for this and we'll just show it to you any any more questions that you may have around what you've seen from now on.
prospect,ah no so far so good.
rep,i'll just show you those campaigns.
rep,one of my colleagues he's searching for it in his lap top we have the screen shots which we run for the likes of __ and host of other middle east clients extra stores hyper panda and so on.
rep,so all these platforms use our web engage engine to engage their customers across tunnel and we have some screenshots of those campaigns that they're running which are in arabic so i think those screenshots should help.
prospect,if they are in arabic if they're using your campaign your system in arabic then it should probably work for us.
rep,yeah yeah yeah.. so the answer is that it works seamlessly the dashboard experience is not in arabic but the campaign building experience is works easily in the arabic format or the language so be rest assured about it i'm just trying to buy your confidence by showing you of you a few of these i think give us five minutes and we show that to you i think by the time we can actually proceed ahead.
rep,fair enough.. all right coming to push notifications i'm just trying to show you the geofencing piece so once you choose to send a push notification you get options of these layouts you can either send only a text-based push or a banner based push or a carousal which is a push notification with multiple images and multiple cts.
prospect,oh these are only applicable for android devices.
rep,android yes this is only for android and then we have a rating based push notification that you can see you so once i create a push i can upload an image i am just choosing any random image for now just for example purpose.
rep,now each of the campaigns this is this is a push notification build up you can see here there is an option of add new variant this allows you to a/b test any campaign using multiple variants.. so i can have four different variants i can add more up to six for one campaign and check which one works the best okay.
prospect,can you define what percentage of the pushes needs to be sent through each variant cgs the winner and send the rest of push notifications in an winner campaign.
rep,so right now right now you can choose how many how much percentage should be sent to a and b for now okay the one where you are saying where we allow you to send to the rest of the users you know the one which wins that particular feature is still in the pipeline it is being built so as of now you can send it to like 50 percent of to one bucket 50% to the rest of users or 60/40 or 70/30 and so on okay and then manually you have to optimize the campaigns but.
prospect,____.
rep,just a sec.. just a second.
prospect,alright.
rep,so here are a few examples.. these are notifications. so this this particular pop-up here is powered by web engage that you see.. this notification again is from web engage.. this is a survey which allows users to submit their their opinion about certain things so you can ask users anything like you know how was your experience on our on our website and you can collect their answers here using this particular form builder and this is completely customizable.
prospect,yeah so it's a full html sort of.
prospect,like can we customize.
rep,yes you're correct.. i think those were those were the examples i think.. just just let me check if i can find any more.. yeah these these were the examples.. here's another one yeah alright.
prospect,we got we got the thing.
rep,perfect.. now here you can specify the cta type you can either specify deep link or an external url based on where you want to redirect the user once he clicks on the push.
prospect,can we push towards can we push to the ___ because i've got a meeting in ten minutes we'll just want to have a chat with you guys about the pricing and that sort of things as well.
rep,sure.
prospect,__ free account and they have looked at some of the features.
rep,absolutely.. great great just let me walk you through the journeys piece i think because i i was not aware that we have less time in hand let me just show you so that we don't we don't miss out on the most important feature that we have.. so this is a journey designer so there are four modules here okay triggers actions conditions and flow control.. triggers would is anything anything in any of these particular options here would allow would would start a workflow for a user it can be user doing a event that is clicking on a button viewing a product page checkout started added to cart and so on or it can be user entering a segment or exiting a segment okay.. so i can say user when enters a particular segment okay yes or i can create a segment on the fly where i can say create new segment and i can specify the option here.
rep,okay so this can trigger a journey now i can say when the user enters a segment i want to send an email to this user and on sending the email so when i send an email i have these options here - on send on open on click on on subscribe on bounds okay after sending the email so this is an option called flow control where i can introduce wait wait periods so i can say after sending email i want to wait for two days or one day or one hour for the event checkout completed so i'm waiting for the user to complete checkout okay up to one hour so here you have minutes hours days weeks and so on.
rep,so i'm saying after user abandons the cart i'm sending an email and i'm waiting for one hour for the user to complete his check out either he'll complete the checkout if he completes the check out i can send another email saying okay giving him a summary of his cart or whatever he's purchased on time out i can send him a push notification on sending the push i can wait for some event and then on time out i can again send let's say a browser push and after that i can again introduce a wait time and i can go on creating this particular journey with multiple touch points.
rep,yes.. and i can also call an api and parse this user's information to your system or fetch something from your system and use it in the communication that is being sent out.
prospect,could you show us an example of.
rep,api call?.
prospect,how you call an api and how you use the fetched data in the next action.
rep,sure sure.. i will show you an example here just a second.. okay.. i'll show you a live journey which we are using for one of our users.. okay this is this is a live journey you will be able to see some stats on the left-hand side.
rep,so these are the users currently in the journey which would keep changing after every two three seconds.. yep.. all right here you can see how many users entered this journey that is 4.9. million how many users reached from step one to step two to step three and so on.. here in the this is the api call block alright.. so we are we are passing them the user email and we are fetching something in return so this is the response that we get.. all right now this response is used in the email that we are sending out this particular email all right now after this we again call an api block to fetch some other information which is again a get query.
rep,but this is dependent on the previous api call block that is why we cannot see the response here but this basically is used to fetch some data from the system which is change which changes dynamically in real time it changes and that is.
prospect,based on the previous api call block.
prospect,i just wanted to see like can you open up this email i want to see how do you use this data with regard to the api call.
rep,sure i will i will show you this email just a second so this here you would not be able to make sense of it here but i think in here this is the email which which gets sent.
prospect,your scale has stopped for some reason.
rep,oh.. i will reshare my screen just a second.. can you see it now.. saman can you see it.. saman can you hear me.. hello.. hello.. hello.. saman are you there.. saman can you hear me.. hello hello.. hello.. yeah can you hear me now.. yeah yeah we can hear you just sharing our screen quickly can you see our screen now.
prospect,yes yeah we can see now.
rep,alright so this is the emailer that we are talking about.
rep,the dynamic pieces over here are the go cash balance the go cash plus balance.
rep,this is the dynamic piece that comes directly from their api their internal systems through our api call the person who is searching for a flight from a particular destination so for example from india to abu dhabi ok.
rep,this is the best pair that is fetched from their system for that particular day.
rep,and this this last table that you see is the the is the fare that is on that particular day that you are searching for and two days prior to that and two days after that so we give suggestions also in terms of what is the best prices in and around those dates where you are planning to travel.
rep,the beauty is that for each and every customer that is being received this email okay that is receiving this email.
prospect,they'll receive their own version of it.
rep,yeah their own version of it which is very personalized and very contextual in nature it will keep changing for example nilay for me it will be india to bahrain for anyone else can be india to abu dhabi any any any other you know destination as well.
prospect,all the details can be passed through to the api so it can be an image url or anything else.
rep,absolutely absolutely correct so this is how the api call works it is a very powerful tool to fetch real-time information and it can be used in in a more of ways we are we are currently exploring new and new ways with a number of clients in every domain be it ed-tech ecommerce travel domains all of them are using this particular piece.. yeah.
prospect,and can we have a look at the reporting system on your journies on how the reporting looks.
rep,so just a sec.. alright so this particular journey that you see all right on the left hand side you can see that how many users are in this particular journey at present you can see the total entries and total exits okay till date.. on each of them.
prospect,is there a time period for that.
rep,sorry.
prospect,can you define a time periods for like those entries or just.
rep,so it is an ongoing journey if at all you have a specified you know time frame in which you want to run the journey it will showcase that particular entry and exit value.
prospect,yeah but can it like can you see like what has happened yesterday with this journey or.
rep,yes yes i'll show you a report just just give me a second so right now the reporting is available in an excel format okay.. just a sec.. so we can take this so this would give you a overview of the communication that is being sent out via multiple channels how many are delivered how many viewed how many clicked.. you can individually check the stats of the particular campaign here by clicking on that button there.. so let's say you send two sms's and three emails in the entire journey you will be able to check cumulative stats as well as individual stats for each campaign.
rep,and on on the whole journey a report that is available in an excel format which i will just download and show it to you just waiting for this to load.. yeah there's very less data so but this is what the what the stats would look like for let's say sms's.
rep,yeah and if we go back to journey if i click on this button here i can download a report.. this one does not have any data in. just a second.. let me download an actual journey report it'll just take a minute more i'm so sorry i'm taking your time but just wanted to show you this particular report how it looks like.
rep,saman saman any any queries around any other piece while i'm downloading this report.
prospect,we got the general idea we'll explore the platform further the only question is i want to know more information about the pricing.
prospect,i'm in a bit of hurry but if you could send me sort of the tiers of pricing you have.
rep,so saman.. so saman just to give you a perspective about the pricing i'll take one minute of your time essentially our pricing is based on your monthly active users okay.
prospect,cool.
rep,yes yes yes i'll keep that in mind and i'll give you the slabs accordingly also i wanted to understand if you have any certain expectations or you know budgets around such an activity i know because the kind of tool that you are exploring obviously it's a strategic call from your end so if at all you have certain budget surrounded for such an activity or for marketing automation if you can give me a sense on that.
prospect,i mean yeah i don't have any any sort of budget in mind as i can tell you right away.
prospect,but i will try to sort of estimate the return on investment we get through this in such a system and then put some value and define a budget for it.
rep,does that work with you.
prospect,yes that works perfectly.
prospect,thanks a lot i appreciate your time.
rep,yeah thanks a lot thanks a lot saman and team pleasure talking to you.. you guys have a great day .
prospect,it was really nice talking to you guys.. have a great day.
rep,bye bye.
rep,so technically we can guarantee 100% availability but on the contract we still go with five nines i mean if i'm perfect because it's like days like three days ago and after four and a half years amazon went down for two hours all the customers were still serviced without an issue because we had redundancies milton and you also have redundancies milton cross geographies where we have an entire redundancies setting in your <> so that in any case if all the infrastructures go down in the us your customers if they can reach your site somehow they'll still be able to actually find products on your site and we also guarantee a sub 300 millisecond response time so that's .
prospect,okay .
rep,and a few things that we've i doing differently especially in the product discovery landscape we have solutions to cover the entire gamut a site search has been a bread and butter it's been our first product a core product but over the last six years we've also innovated to the entire spectrum today we so product recommendations we help you power category pages we have a recent product that we've launched late last year called segment and target where you can essentially personalised products for your end users based on various segmentation logic as well i can take you through that and we have a visual merchandising tool if you used inbecka experience manager something very similar but a lot more comprehensive and a lot mostly curvy why to actually use it and all our products are under driven because we understand early as in landscape this is fairly important and what might work for a similar retailer might not work for you right so we understand that it is very impressive so what we do is we have a poc model where we can actually come in do in page ajax methodology where we don't have to deploy any of your resources but we can still take your site up and running in four weeks with our solution you can either test it offline and a staging configuration or you can probably test it we'll say five of traffic and what we can also prove to you is in a eight week window what level is your baseline metrics is for search rate conversions we can prove it to you that we at least will know 10% or better so that even before you actually use our product you can actually test it out so that there is actually value to what we are actually talking about.
prospect,that's always good exactly there's actual value and not just talking value.
rep,correct and and the reason we actually put this on a contract is because we've seen success in every vertical that we've worked with it could be like the furniture and home depot you're seeing is actually actually then it would be expressed it could be rue 21 it could be us auto iv supply a new egg or a catalogue man like pottery two things you would notice consistently with our product is the a the uptick in in conversion up taken average or the value and corresponding uptick in revenue hence we put that 10% guarantee does on the contract.
prospect,interesting.
rep,and this is an exhaustive list of all the components that we have on our site search from a technology standpoint everything is built on you seen but we've essentially hacked into scene and built in all these components that you see from a machine learning perspective from an entire ecommerce relevancy perspective and a merchandising perspective on top of it to form an entire comprehensive search system.
prospect,interesting you know i think just looking at this you know some of the things that i might want to there may be a few things that i want to get into a little bit more detail on beyond our you know the next 20 minutes in particular you know you know what you guys do well i guess the merchandise you work with is interesting just for .
prospect,that's a real challenge that we're actually facing into and how we support our merchandising team you know but i look at you know some of the other stuff the advanced search the core search and the smart auto suggest to those are those are things that we are actually doing.
rep,but i may want to get into more detail to figure out there's something that you guys could be doing differently or that would actually enhance what it is that we do.
rep,okay well i actually of taking you through a presentation given that we have 15-20 minutes to go i'll actually take you to a live site probably in a different vertical but at least i'll give you some context of say what we're talking about and i'll probably explain all the features with probably one example so that you get some perspective i so i i know express is a completely different vertical to the vertical you are in.
prospect,i know it.
rep,yeah so but the reason i showed you is because they have a fairly large online business and they have recent number of skus as well so for them what we've done is express as apparel so their requirement when they came to us on board was a they wanted segmentation logic to be applied because in apparel probably styles my vary in different locations so they wanted to have a segmentation logic builder and they wanted the experience on the entire product discovery to be very visual centric and they wanted it to dynamically change for who you are as a person so what the a few things we have built for them.
rep,first experience the auto suggests which is probably the first experience user could get on the site today if you start looking for a products a jeans the way we have built the experiences to be a guided and be visual right .
rep,jeans is a jeans for women is a jeans from men is a jeans of a specific style and then depending on which location you are coming in from we look into the real-time click stream data and actually show you products for that location and the images change as you start hovering around right.
rep,and this has been made intelligent where say now if i look for dress and we an our system understands that express catalogue does not carry dress for men women but now if i just increase this to dress shirts now it will show you products for men .
rep,did that make sense.
prospect,totally make sense.
rep,so this was the first experience right and i'll start addressing as to what are the challenges that could be with a solar based on an inbecka based approach that you might be having today it is very difficult to build a logic on auto suggest and also change products dynamically based on segmentation and we can do various kinds of segmentation here like one of the logic they have applied is geo location but we can do segmentation by a user type it which might be relevant in your case it could be a new user versus and returning logged in user you could show him or her specific set of products we can show recommendation based on past purchases that we could do we could also build an experience like where if you have people who buy more than one product in a single transaction and with granger you might have a lot of repeat users who already know what is available on your site and they might just want to come and do a fast checkout right this is where we could also help where for somebody like grocery which where this experience is very similar this is actually one of the largest e-grocers in southeast asia we also work with in fresh direct in new york but these guys is have a much larger volume midwest they actually do about two billion dollars online and for them their average cart size is 46 products in a transaction and what we did for them is if i buy chicken every week and if i'm a returning user the moment i start typing in chicken the way the auto suggest functionality is built is where you can actually change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box either and then we show all the commonly search term popular brands and categories so you can really customise it to where you want to show it right.
prospect,yeah started to bring searching you're starting to bring search results into the search box .
rep,correct that's the one so the second thing that we solved for is automating this whole functionality of error tolerance right.
rep,there could be spelling mistakes there could be stemmed words the way most e-tailors end up doing this is by building the list of synonyms or trying to build some kind of automation project on it which is not entirely foolproof .
rep,what we've tried doing is we have trained our machine learning oil algorithm on a global catalogue extreme trained and passed across 200 million words used in the -tail landscape and we've also trained this by vertical what does a specific word means in an apparel vertical versus pharma versus an auto parts versus machine versus a grocery right .
rep,so it's much more sensitive to understand words misspelled like a give me give you an example i will probably take a three letter word and misspell all three letter i'll take i'll miss spell the word black leather jacket i'll say b_l_c_k_l_e_a_t_h_e_j_a_k_e_t misspell all the three words two things you should observe one is it auto corrects itself it will show you results from the word go and it is super fast while i just doing that right.
rep,and you don't and this happens automatically you don't have to build anything at your back-end right .
rep,the third is managing stemming consistency site in express like t-shirts right depending on the the probably the type of customer they could look for t-shirts in different ways like i could come and look for t-shirts with a space in between right they show me say 473 results with these products being shown my son might come and look for t-shirts tees so the intent is not change so the results you show and the images you show should not change again.
prospect,are you managing that through a an open synonym list or are you actually doing that are you doing something else from a technology perspective in order to be able to drive all huh .
rep,so again one is obviously the entire logic of the machine learning platform understanding as to all the words that have been used in the e-commerce context and how they are same to each other plus we have a synonym repository of close to to close about
rep,1.7 million synonyms that's the machine learning system has been trained on so it can automate most of these experiences but at the same time we also have a dashboard where if there are some very specific jargon which is very specific to grainger as a brand we also give you an option to go and add a synonym but the logic here is in 99% of the cases you don't have to do anything it will automatically correct itself and learn as to how people might be finding products on your site did that explanation help.
prospect,yeah it did sorry so part of what i'm thinking of rakesh is your is your talking is good obviously a lot of this stuff is great and it would be even more valuable had we not had we not gone through and built built some of it and then constantly working to top to my didn't improve it so it's one of those things where i wish i had i wish i was around in this in this team you know seven years ago i could have actually gotten them to actually make some different decisions rather than making the decision to go with inbecka back in 2008 so there's value there i think the one thing is is the interesting is how do you go about retrofitting and existing existing logic i mean time i have a
prospect,1.7 million synonyms we actually have more than that in our synonym library which was built on top of inbecka but then fed through through machine learning as well based specifically around kind of this this mro space and i'm not saying that because we're better i'm just giving you an idea can i order magnitude i mean.
rep,correct.
prospect,how many units how many i how many items as express have in terms of you know like as web parents versus the different permutations of size what are they are .
rep,so express is smaller i think express all variations will come up to about 320000.
rep,there parent skus at about 28000 .
prospect,<> sorry go ahead.
rep,sorry but for somebody never us auto their parents skus of looked at about
rep,2.3 million but all the variations when you combine all the parts to the models of the car the fitment comes to 700 million.
prospect,yeah .
rep,so so it's a different landscape on i'm sure granger will have a couple of million for sure .
prospect,yeah a couple million is is riding wine now which i'm just asking because i think part of that challenge is that i mean that's where the challenge comes in work you know i love the expresses website i think it's great and it's you know the images are great because each item has a unique image because it's part of the merchandising strategy whereas i think one of the challenges with the mro space is that not every you know not every item actually comes with a default.
prospect,correct absolutely.
rep,<>.
prospect,<>
prospect,you talked about on one of your slides you know the fact you've gone in you retrofitted atg and solar another thing right give me give me an idea what what's your approach just to going in going in and actually you know ripping out an old search engine and building you know building a new one.
rep,yeah i think the first approach we take and we i just learning with large catalogue sites and large inbecka implementations in new egg in us auto where initially i think the first thing to do is to learn to coexist with that system as phase one where there are a bunch of things and endeca a solar cell system could be connected with which we do probably would not know the magnitude of how interconnected they are so our strength as a platform is relevancy right so we say okay let's solve the relevancy for a problem for you first right and we take it a phased approach where eventually the goal could not be to replace inbecka or solar but it might it might scare a lot of people if we say that on day one right we take it as a phased approach where you have already built so many things already so let's use what you have built let's zoom that customise the platform so that we probably solve a problem like do you want us to only solve your autosuggestion problem today we can only do that and show it to you and then probably move to the next problem to solve or we can solve relevancy problem for you first or we can come and solve a merchandising problem for you so we could take a phase approach the intent here is to at least make sure we get an opportunity to get in and work with you and and then given how your strategy is eventually the platform has all the capabilities that could replace an entire inbecka our system into in and probably do a lot more which is inbecka does not do personalization.
rep,but we can also start small and probably hundred one part of the problem today and then scale up from there.
prospect,yeah i think they i think what you're hitting on is one of the challenges that we face and it's not that i'm you know so i'm constantly challenged to look for different solutions like you know i'm looking through like on the components right so we already have all four other components of the smart the smart auto suggest it doesn't mean they can't be improved for us but we already at them so it has sure.
prospect,we already have the core search obviously from everything from in alaska's spell correction to your synonym mapping your stemming now inbecka stemming files is terrible you know that so yeah we've built our own then you like a dance or so you you got the relevant you've got the behaviour so the customer interaction data you know those things you're like you know the global catalogue to exclude irrelevant so that's one thing i'd be interested in you know the how you actually improve the diversity and the freshness i have no idea what that is so kind of interesting the industry model that's not something that we actually have but we are we have gone down the path of we know who customers are what industry they're from so we're pulling all that information and we're changing the results there again could it be improved absolutely right but it's it's there the merchants eyes or prints that's something we don't have right and just we don't have anything other than some homegrown solutions that could use a lot of love
prospect,so that's that's helpful then i start to get into mobile not as not as much i think there's value there but you know it's not as not as critical base and we're at and then you know the insights obviously sometimes can where that that so what i think about sharath is i the coexisting is interesting but that to me feels like i worry about how those truly exist in the similar situation because if we have to go through and rip out inbecka which obviously i'm in the process of doing so now i've got to do it page by page based on all the different search results i've got to do it mi my on might you know my category level my different grouping level down to my <> and then i've got to do it you know in the search results and i could do it across my different types of search results that are pulling information in from different areas then i've got to do it on the item detail page as well .you know you know those are no small feed right that you don't you don't sign it sign an agreement and then six weeks later you have a new experience right .
rep,i understand that.
rep,so that's that's what i'm just kind of thinking about so it's those are the things that are in my head is we're taught as we're talking because platforms are phenomenal what i really want to in you know when you talk about conversion rate you know the conversion rates are good are great as well i love to see those those increases those examples on the previous site are phenomenal do are those i wonder kind of you know that because you won't live with one thing because you went live with everything.
rep,it doesn't mean the combination but i think at least these six examples are definitely when we are doing it end to end.
rep,because doing these numbers are not easy to achieve and we can do it on when via when our machine learning platform is truly emitted into the system but just to answer your first part of the question and i know your challenges today but one thing that we've tried doing is if you're using say solar today or or in inbecka today i told you about how platform-agnostic yeah all right this to just test it out we we can consume the same response that comes to your solar system or comes to your inbecka system we can give the same response that your back end application will make technically not know that it's coming from a solar or it's coming from unbxd.
rep,so we can tune it to that degree so that you don't have to do too many changes at your end to just t see how we actually work for you so that is something that we've done which probably could make it simpler to actually at least test it out initially.
prospect,now you said do you you guys put an unbxd on the page is that what you said .
rep,no no i'm saying that from an api response standpoint .
rep,so we can basically mimic the response of inbecka or a solar so that your application will technically not know from where it's coming from so you can do all the logic of if you have four specific city you have a specific pricing which probably she has even if you have some complex logic on your application and if you're worried as to how a new system will integrate with it we can technically mimic the entire response that you're a solar as inbecka is doing today just so that you could you don't have to do too much of work at your end so you could still see how the system could work in the environment that you have and and see how we can take it up from that.
rep,yep i just put it up on the screen i'll try and see if i can get some snapshots out to you as well this is like a high-level workbench this gives you an all the entire overview then you can get into merchandising where you can merchandise for your search you can run campaigns the way you want it like you can go and create any new campaign just give you an example march essentially you can create the campaign and then start doing segmentation whether you want to throw it to a different device start date end date and then start merchandising for it i know in one minute i can't do just to show you this
prospect,i will be interesting kind of how you merchandising and how you set the experience those are things that i'm definitely interested in understanding a little bit more.
prospect,the things that we currently have that if we're adding just another layer on top of those that's just something that i mean i have to wrestle with that internally not that's not your challenge to solve sure.
rep,i understand but let me do this john i'll forward you this information i have myron to connect with rick i think one thing that has changed from the last time monal my colleague who is in chicago spoke to rick was the entire segment and target in the personalization product that we have come out with apart from that the search product is probably just improved but most of the core element still remain the same so you can take as feedback i am actually in chicago the week of 13 so i'm happy to drive down if you have any availability that we can probably do a one-hour in-person and take you through all these elements again .
prospect,yeah we're actually we have our national meeting in florida so i'm actually i'm travelling next week with customers and the following week is when we're all on we're all in orlando so that won't work let me and then the following back as you imagine is just is kind of getting back up give me a favour shoot me over what you've actually what you got or something representative that let me take a look at it let me get a chance to talk with rick i'm not travelling with him but i should probably have a couple of phone calls with them next week and then i figure out and then we can determine kind of what what next steps look like but i'm i'm interested in learning more so we can figure out kind of what we what we might be able to explore .
rep,absolutely i think that would be a great start and i read your feedback and i keep coming to chicago every alternate week so you could let the over find.
prospect,opportunities across you together.
rep,yep absolutely all right and if you're attending any of these large conferences the shoptop off or irc and we'll be there almost in every major conference.
prospect,so that would make up that would make total sense all right well i gotta run to another discussion because unfortunately friday's far too full but shoot me shoot me know with some of that other stuff and i'll take a look and i'll get back here i've had a chance to talk to rick.
rep,no problem sir thank you so much on dealing with the head.
prospect,thank you nice to meet you thanks for the conversation.
rep,conversation discussion and anything that excites you and take it from there is that okay with you.
prospect,sounds good.
rep,perfect.
rep,so i think daniel if you can open the presentation that mark had shared with you like and i will just give you a brief overview and you know we'll take it from there.
rep,it should be from mark.
prospect,when did you send them mart.
rep,last week late last week i let me see.
rep,on friday.
rep,before i start have you heard about us got some info something from the forum here and there before this interaction started.
prospect,no.
rep,then i think it's a clean white slate so i mean go ahead and paint the picture.
rep,so i think brilio is one of the few organizations of space who's focusing in becoming of pure play technology solution partner with our customers in the digital space and you know when we say digital we are talking about the whole digital ecosystem along with bi analytics and big data kind kind of coming together.
rep,because in our minds i think both these think experience and analytics need to come together to build up the true digital solutions for our customer right so and we have started with this team and we are kind of focusing on this as the area right to focus and grow.
rep,as an organization i think we have had phenomenal growth over the last three years of our existence.
rep,we currently now operate out of 10 global offices our global headquarters is right in the heart of silicon valley in santa clara.
rep,and our other large office in us new jersey so very close to where you are.
rep,big locations in us and we have our global presence in london in norway and all largely be centers based over bangalore india and that's how we are spread.
rep,close to 2500 plus what we call this brilliance or working with us focusing on building the next-gen digital solutions for our customer.
rep,and if you think that we've started doing mark and given you know this area is so much relying on the collaboration and you know the nearness we have to our customers we have open to innovation labs and when it based in silicon valley where you know we kind of do the whole ideation all the you know high-end discussions with our customer and then kind of take it to a solution and take to a deliverable.
rep,right so our which will have is based in silicon valley our second innovation lab is in bangalore and that's where we have been kind of operating.
rep,overall from a focus perspective as i said daniel i think we have been focused very much in the transformational digital space for our customers and this has been our area of focus so if you move over to slide number three that kind of gives you a broad sense of when somebody tells we are from brillio and what brillio does.
rep,i think this is what we do right so i think if you look at the whole spectrum given the nature of the space right you need to have a very very strong focus on the whole ideation and the whole creation thought process right because it's not it's not run-of-the-mill kind of what we're trying to do is i'm trying to think new is trying to come up with new use cases is trying to come up with advance analytic scenarios for our customer right that's where the magic comes to play and this is where lot of collaboration and i think joint thinking and ideation happens with a customer where we kind of take an idea put some thoughts around it fail fast learn fast and kind of come up with something that is a very tangible use case that can impact your business right.
rep,so that's our primary engagement area that with a lot of our customers and that's primarily done from our innovation labs and our delivery center in bangalore.
rep,then we move on to the whole creating that once you get an idea once you get a thought process you think this is something that you want to add on bring in the actual whole digital ecosystem in play right where it becomes all about how the it comes into play how the variables come into play.
rep,what is the design you want think what analytics ecosystem you want to build around it.
rep,and that's where the whole digital experience and design comes into play from brillo side.
rep,that is actually the core of the whole solution idea and that's where it fits in your area right.
rep,everything that we build in this place has to have the right foundation from a data analytic standpoint.
rep,because we believe that things are changing so fast and so quickly for our customers so their ability to sense and respond to that change at the same pace is very important and that's where the whole foundation of the data analytics piece comes together where we kind of bring in the old big data technologies traditional data the right governance around it right and put the whole model and then on top of that model build out the analytics engine that kind of meets all the use cases and thought processes that you have from a business standpoint right so using all the machine learning algorithms all the predictive analytics and then high end data front this that we have in our system kind of coming together and solving a business problem from an analytic standpoint.
rep,we're doing all that you need to make sure all the  traditional minds of a traditional infrastructure or a traditional house that we used to have in the technology space right so thats where we have virtual expanded into the overall digital engineering ecosystem right that's where we're talking about how do we have the devops ecosystem how do we have the broad first thought process right and how do we build the whole next-gen platform for a customer that responds in the same pace as we expect the whole digital front-end to respond right.
rep,so i think it is a broad spectrum of i notice for a customer and as we went along in the journey we have created our own accelerator and platforms across each you know our that you see which we think is the focus from our side is just to make sure the time to market keeps on increasing for our customers as we learn along with right.
rep,if we did something saying we took a week before our goal is to do it in three days next time  so we can keep innovating on that pace and that's where all the platforms and accelerator that you see at the bottom comes into play for our customers right and you know every time we go in kind of package it for others and broadly from our industry vertical perspective right it's given our start given our size it's very difficult to focus on all the industry that are out there so retail cpg becomes one of the core foundation of our thought process so we are working with likes of puma likes of us foods those who the customers in the retail activity space.
rep,where we work in the data analytics space some of the examples right.
rep,and the thought process is how do we kind of take something that is out there for our customers from a use case standpoint and how do we take it to a realized solution point of view correct.
rep,and i pause for a while i know is there any broader questions on brillio i can understand answer that before i move on.
prospect,not really i mean you know there's too much here to ask a question right.
rep,okay so i will now given that your area and i understand you're managing the whole bi analytics and other things from coty standpoint so i will kind of focus a little bit on the that are and kind of talk to some use cases and something that we're doing which we feel are very interesting and i would like to hear your thoughts and what is something that is kind of out there that you are trying to do or you are doing and see where all this lines up.
prospect,i mean i can tell give you little bit of insights responses although so what we you mention cloud first so we're no longer have any internal infrastructure we're entirely on amazon so or big you know including our digital platform so i don't run digital digital the whole separate team mind you we're a channel manufacturer we're not really a retailer.
prospect,so we don't touch customers per se um we have digital properties but the digital properties are more informational and you know the call to action would then typically shoot over to one of our retail partners.
rep,i thought.
prospect,we have one small ecommerce presence with our philosophy brand but i mean it's 20 to 20 million dollars or something it's not like the grand scheme of things it's a rounding here.
prospect,it's yeah it's just not that big and it's very us-based um but we do i mean you know we do have a little bit of a challenge right now it's interesting actually we have a little bit of a challenge with okay so a little bit about how bi works here so bi and sort of spread across a few platforms but we're a little bit sure kind of consolidation to all data on amazon.
prospect,our main enterprise warehouse is redshifted okay and we're actually situated right across the street from the redshift team.
prospect,or the way they have direct contact with the head of the product and.
prospect,you know we're just about the largest warehouse on amazon believe it or not.
prospect,so it's it's it's on redshift that is and we truly have end to end warehousing and we use microstrategy cloud also built inside inside aws for all our analytics.
prospect,so we have a whole other tools but we're trying to rapidly consolidate to microstrategy and and slowly surely move it all towards the current version of it obviously.
prospect,so there's some there's some cool gravity in the way that we can move things down what i'd say because it's on amazon all of our digital presence on amazon as well.
prospect,and in fact i know our digital team is leveraging google analytics to just look at the click stream the but you know the typical behavioral stuff um and they do some predictive so we actually own we were subsidiary that's a digital firm that does all of our does all of our digital analytics specific to you know kind of optimizing the way customers come to and utilize our brand sides and making sure that they're getting connected experientially we're understanding the behavior and understanding how it converts to sales that sort of thing.
prospect,as well as social so they're you know they're getting something sprinkler to do some social navigating but one of the things we're trying to do is get that all get the mashups of so so these datasets don't normally have they don't have like conforming dimensionality right so it's not like i could just take it all pharaoh it together into giant a normalized.
prospect,you end up having these mashups that like we're the only kind of normal thing i can analyze things on its time which from a predictive perspective lends itself to time series but we also have i mean you can do a little bit just testing different variables and looking they're kind of kind of collinearity and understanding how they interact the the the interesting thing is that now with our microstrategy.
prospect,one things we're doing is it has the ability to actually call in the context of a single mashup data from google analytics from amazon wherever we put data and has on including hadoop and pull it all together in a single visualization in a single kind of analytic.
prospect,so that that's kind of the new horizon for us and we're trying to build all the analytics there.
prospect,we do have a strategy we just went over actually last week as a team to what their mobilize all of it so make sure that any kind of analytic we're doing i mean where it makes sense right any kind of analytic or resulting insight from some of these these these types of what i would call i don't know insightful analytics or reports get surfaced on mobile devices so our executives or gm's and so forth can actually react in real time as the information starts to flow.
prospect,um so we see images looking at your offering so probably don't have much of a need in the platform space.
prospect,probably what i would say the one area where i just think think we're not lacking i mean i have a vendor i work with but i'm candidly i've inherited them they're not likely one of my first choice or anything but is to actually do the analytics and the one thing i've seen and it's not just them i looked at many other firms including the monsters like an ibm or something mmm-hmm is there's lots of smart guys there's lots of people with phds and statistics and so forth they can do you know run through an analytical exercise but kind of it's the really deep knowledge in a specific industry from a business perspective like the cadence of the business the structure the type of data that like the syndicated providers are offering good a typical output from a transactional system so they can understand the flow of information from supply chain perspective show them to the channel.
prospect,that knowledge is really difficult to find in a person that also has a phd in analytics or data analytics or data science.
prospect,so right.
prospect,for me that's work that's what i would be willing to pay for somebody for that i can't can't quite fun i mean.
prospect,what i really would love to do you could package up an insight and give it back to my business partners as they were saying let me provide you the right kind of analytic solution you make of it what you will.
prospect,be better for and we i've been through this exercise two or three times and different kind of i get a peers of yours in the industry um who kind of they've gave it a college try right they've said well you know it was your spicy data we'll try to help you better anticipate inventory positions which is one where it's a big one for us we have a lot of inventory sitting and our dc's at any time um. and they come up with some interesting insights you know but it's not it's more general it's not like an actionable piece of information where it's reusable so like every tuesday you know take the algorithm they've created run it through this base data that's been isolated in clans and there's a resulting buy two more of those or you mean like change your such-and-such purchasing contract.
prospect,i mean it's never to that level.
prospect,it's always very like well you might want to consider or you might want to further you know analyze or so i guess there's that sense that analytics for us has always been like it almost gets you to a cul-de-sac we're looking for the road to for us to get to certainly down the street but but with a clear vision towards and we can just take this and make it make it a repeatable event and efficiently obviously we want make a repeat all that without having to involve a roomful phd that takes time we went updated etc.
prospect,so that's kind of what we're looking at i think we have we've yet to really do too much with the unstructured i think we don't honestly much of that because we're not and that's you know we're not in the we're not in the retail space so we don't have customer information per se so there's not that much like we're you know we might do a little bit around facebook we might but that's all proven over time to be kind of a fool's game honestly.
prospect,it's more like a it's more like a sensor than it is a true indicator hmm and you know sensor can get fouled up or sensors can lie to you because they don't you know there's they're sensing more than you want them to or less and you know you need to really understand you know sort of you know language and that kind of thing if you really want to parse tweets and crap like that thing.
prospect,i'm not sure we're there and i don't know that will that it would be a good endeavor for us or a useful endeavor us to go down that road.
rep,okay okay.
prospect,but i do see us having huge opportunities as it relates to the full value chain so understand we get you know a whole lot of point of sale information.
rep,okay next question i was about to ask do you get a lot of point of sale information.
prospect,we get the point of sale direct from the retailer so sometimes tailors give us that kind of information we put it in our pocket and we analyze it and we get it by week typically.
rep,okay .
prospect,as well as inventory positions.
prospect,we  have sell in obviously so we've been able to to the retailers come on not usually by store because the way the retail channel works i think you know they probably they had their own dc you don't have to i don't know you know walmart main distribution center would have a truckload of sodium we have no idea what made it to the independent director.
prospect,so the best we know is we'll be buying walmart point-of-sale data is actually how much is selling through those? correct.
prospect,so we know it's volunteer to us what the door sales are right volunteer we buy it or get our for contracts a second you a lot of the big retailers.
prospect,yeah big retailers yeah we have that we have the syndicated stuff so like the neo to mpd iri for film your monitor or what have you.
prospect,we have we do similar kinds of things with retail distributors so we have a network of several hundred distributors mostly in smaller markets right we don't what i don't have a distribution presence or let's say just not a strong one.
prospect,but they will they will often looks a lot like the pos data right they'll give a get a they'll give us the shipments the shipments to the smaller retailers that they actually ship to and how many how much etcetera and then of course we have sell in.
prospect,and then we have it all the way back to the supply chain so we have in our enterprise warehouse we have every material movement that's whether it's from the non finished goods up to the to the factories and its conversion into finished goods as well as the inventory movements from the ends of the machines in to pick locations and then into the distributor centers.
prospect,so it's a end view view we just haven't been able to make great use of it yet.
rep,so i think you know this is a great great thought process.
rep,okay so let me kind of expand this a little bit right so if you were in an ideal world if you were able to make some insights out of it am i right to say that the kind of analysis that typically would like to have is you know predict out of stock situations and kind of i don't know how much out of auto stock do you figure out you have but i've seen customers really struggle with either access inventory at certain locations versus out of stock in certain locations.
rep,right out of stock analysis is something that is primarily one of the key insights that combining this information you will get out of it if you do it really right right.
prospect,i mean that's one you know inventory out of stock or staying within window is one thing. another big one for us is another big one for us is like you know there is a real drive right now to increase top-line so i think there's a lot of understanding i mean if i if there's one thing i could tell the business it would be hugely beneficial to them and it's difficult to understand by the way.
prospect,i don't know what the analytical approach would be i've done it my life but not with this divergence of what is some new activity right right on the sense of if i invest a dollar in a and cp in this brand in this you know to win this channel.
prospect,excuse me.
prospect,it's going to result in a dollar five in return whereas if i do it over here it's going to result ninety seven cents so i should avoid it like the plague.
prospect,simply simply put that kind of insight with i mean we right our business is driven just like every other cpg is driven by by by a ncp so that where we invest that money and where they know and then some sense of where innovation we know where innovation is lagging right but we don't know what it's costing us.
prospect,so is ck3 actually know the answer this question based on sales but it would be good to know if we said look ck2 to based on the history of fragrance is a transitional point if you don't innovate in this whatever at this point product lifecycle you were at extreme risk of you know sort of market fatigue their kind of product is really at this end of life they're looking for something different.
prospect,i don't know i mean these are the kind of things where those sorts of indicators to our business partners would be magnificent.
prospect,i apologize in advance by the way it literally has to drop in two minutes because i got a jump off call.
rep,sure that's fine so i think you know my last thought on that and that you know i want to quickly come back to saying that if you were to take scenario that data sets you identified right which is point of sale inventory shipments your internal and external syndicated data  and you get a data and kind of build out couple of scenarios that can help you get more predictions around your product lifecycle your out of stock scenario now this is your promotion effect known as you touched upon that we don't have enough time to go through the detail of you know promotion rio and you know a function returns but i think i'll keep that in mind is that something that you were particularly at the end. if you were to build these use cases as how do we see it come to life i kind of do some kind of a proof from our side will that be exciting enough for you know kind of spend more time and you know we can plan definitely have more face to face more closer because i'm interesting over the close by.
prospect,so if you had a good use case i mean i have to be honest is a little i'm a little bit you know tapped in terms of resources right now but if we could carve out a little use case for you absolutely i will give you a shot and lets see what you can come back with.
rep,perfect okay let me give you circle back on that daniel we'll put our thoughts together.
rep,it is a good idea couple of use case and see how we can do it.
rep,i got a circle back with you with what i do you think next year would work for you for us to come back i know we are hitting holiday season.
prospect,i i'm thinking so realistically like the first so you know worse usually involved in the close of our in the middle of an integration by the way so okay.
rep,oh i'm gonna say probably the week of the maybe 16th of january that i'll give you couple of weeks.
prospect,i've workshops the week of the nine sixteen and twenty third the first week that i come up here the week of the thirty.
rep,okay so let's sukesh and myself block some time with you on 30th to our use cases.
rep,and i put some thought process in advance to tell you what in cases we are running so that you can say hey change this or change that so that you know when it come to meet you the week of 30th we have something that is exciting.
rep,thank you daniel.
prospect,thank you.
rep,which you might be interested in with the area of supply chain right.
rep,so these people pretend materials they try to take the first you know 15 minutes to give you an introduction to what we do and then you know we can open up for any questions or you know if you fill in anything which body or instead you could speak more about that.
rep,we can see how with how we can in the last 15mins.
prospect,yes then i'm gonna preface this also by saying that there's very good chance that i may not be the person that you want to talk. we had you know for for providing a service there may be some other area the way that it typically would work in an area is is they would send out you know rfps for for folks to these usually a bidding process that sort of thing that's handled by our procurement group.
prospect,so when we're done here and i have an idea what you're doing what i would do is forward information onto our procurement group and then at which point time there there maybe say a bid that would go out and they would contact you folks they would you know then they would have to at least have your information as well.
prospect,so i think that that's really the way to go here but that said yeah but but it's easier for me to present this to go to them and say hey you know i spoke to these folks and you know usually they do and pass along the information that way.
rep,absolutely kevin we understand that.
rep,we would do look a certain guidance from you know if there are specific problems that you know like it is right now looking at or you know trying to solve or you know like you said that  here are you know certain bids which are coming up whatever the problem is this is just if you can give some guidance around that what because me what you saw absolutely.
prospect,yeah i don't yeah i'll do my best i'll do my best but again i may not be that i work in reverse logistics and not forward logistics but lets move forward i want to just try to get an idea what you folks do.
rep,like i mentioned like i'll start off with the introduction about the company.
rep,so we are 300 companies expected in the we are around 2000 people across the globe and that means they're spread across us india and europe.
rep,most of our presence is in india where as  most of our customers are in us.
rep,so we try to deliver all of our services from india with you know some key folks in the project based out of us. so that's largely how we operate and in terms of what we do we we reach out to the new normal companies which means you know as we try to tackle everything digital so it includes services around mobility services around internet of things services around cloud and most importantly the focus of the discussion which is data and analytics so when we again go a little deeper into the data area of data analytics. we have the entire spectrum of capabilities be it the plumbing of data you know like it could be big data it could be the old school data like just erp and crm of the world right it could be either when we have the capability to bring all of together in a structured format which makes it consumable for generating insights out of it right. so we have our own big data platform access   especially you know if there are of this internet of things if there are sensors or iot devices involved if there are real real-time streaming data involved that's when you know our big data platform concept really becomes helpful. it can capture any better kind of unstructured data.
rep,it can format it such that you can generate analytics you can do analytics on top of that generate visualizations or insights on top of it. so that is the data plumbing capability we bring and moving on a little further downstream right which is the analytics piece of it which is really the intelligence which comes out of data.
rep,here again we have like you know wide spectrum of capabilities.
rep,we have the basic capabilities which include visualization which is more about ensuring the insights which come out of reports stand out for the customers right ensuring if there are expections to standard operations - those stand out in our report.
rep,so the basic visualization capabilities that while basic  which is probably the most widely adopted and the most useful for organizations as such we bring in a lot of capability around that area.
rep,going a little upstream we have data scientist in our team who handles much more advanced data analytics capabilities right.
rep,which involves statistics and which which invloves complex optimization algorithms and which involves complex forecasting algorithms and the likes.
rep,so we have the data scientists who bring in these capabilities to be able to elevate this whole analytics game from just visualization to making making it more insightful making it more predictive in terms of you know using data to figure out what will happen rather than just stay at a point where you can figure out what has happened and you know trying to
rep,so the data capabilities that our data scientist bring brings on on the table that kind of elevates the game a little more for the organization being a little more smarter and you know like a drive in being able to know what what to expect from the market or what to expect from operations right.
rep,so in terms of drawing the capability from analytics this is what we will cover.
rep,but having said that what really differentiates us is like why i said the fact that it will hold in your capabilities and digital right so we don't really believe in this whole black box approach to analytics which we'll you know a lot of organizations have complex algorithms and complex analytics tools within the organization but nobody really trusts them and nobody really understands what goes behind them right because we have capabilities in you know like a wide spectrum of technology be it cloud or be it front-end applications or be it mobility etcetera we do which let us you know move to a more white box and more transparent way of incorporating analytics into the organizations right.
rep,what we mean by that is we make the whole data injection process automated we try to make sure what factors go into the models we try to make that more transparent if there are data science teams within the organization we give them some power with our tools for them to be able to play around with some of these things - the predictors and the variables which are going into the model some choice of what kind of models to be selected and if it's purely business users we kind of hide all these complexities from them but what we give them is the power of simulation right to be able to do certain kind of what-if scenario kind of analysis.
rep,to probably make it more real maybe we can you know like talk about an example i take an example specifically from the supply chain space.
rep,what we've done for one of our customers actually who are in india is we we've done our tackle and network optimizations problem for them there are specific problem statement was they wanted to know the exactly to position their distribution centers so this involves minimizing the transportation costs ensuring that the service levels that they have agreed to the  point of the retailers are not disturbed and all this while ensuring that all this ensuring of considering the demand that that is there in various parts of the market right.
rep,so we have this widely built out comp- it involved evaluating you know around external  combinations of locations across the country so we hosted this algorithm on an big data platform where there's a  completely shielded from all this complexity. all that they got was a scenario simulator where they could give their business constraints that you know my service levels should not go below x number of days or if they thought the result they got out of that was not the best on what they anticipated in some function they could you know modify the constraint to say you know what for 90% of my point of sale i should not you know who go below my service level of y percent.
rep,so this gave the power of analytics into the hand of the business user which meant that without being you know like too entangled - into  into the nitty-gritty of what happens behind the some of these algorithms they could play around with it figure out the scenarios do a deep pen analysis using visualization.
rep,that's what i meant by oceans away from black box approach.
rep,and going a little more broader in terms of what kind of analytics we do in a supply chain space kevin so we do a lot of analytics in the strategic areas like you know like figuring out what should be the product assortment may be in store or like i just spoke about the network design problem or if the manufacturing is in what if you have the production capacity or the production rate or you know from the procurement side of things probably doing more segmentation of the suppliers or you know consolidating the suppiers for all rationalizing suppliers right.
rep,so these are generally delivered as one of consulting exercises these are more for strategic long-term decisions for sure probably the you know automation tools which i just spoke about might not be more relevant.
rep,you know what we bring in most is our domain expertise.
rep,what we bring in most is our expertise with data analytics and this is you know mostly short term memory deliver exit of ..
rep,so that's the play in the strategic area where the simulators which i spoke about really comes into play is in the planning area of supply chain right where there is a demand forecasting problem or if there is a shelf state optimization problem these are the kind of problems which a decision-maker has to grapple with often and probably do not want to rely on a data scientist every time that they want to deal with it right.
rep,and this is the technicality area where you do a lot of simulators and a lot tool for analytics and you know there are of course other areas like inventory planning and continuous replenishment here where you have to figure out the inventory stocks at every point of the supply chain every phase of the supply chain right or the stock *norms* which have to be maintained at every phase of the supply chain.
rep,so these are typical areas where you build out these tools.
rep,and the last part is obviously the supply chain operations where there are day to day questions to be answered where you need real-time monitoring of certain api's where you need to ensure certain sla's are being met where you ensure that you know certain compliance levels are being maintained.
rep,so these are you know specific areas which we try to deliver by building centers of excellence on behalf of our customers.
rep,so if you all need to port our customers with you know our data analyst here rarely advanced analytics skills are involved typically.
rep,that's mostly the data analyst kind of skills which are involved who helps automating some of these data injection and helps this insightful presentations and insightful reports and insightful visualizations for the business users.
rep,so broadly these are our capabilities.
rep,i'll take up ***** kevin you know basically if you are is there any specific areas you'd like to hear more about.
prospect,no. i'm good here i am just trying to take it all in here there's a lot of information it's an impressive presentation you've got here with loaded with lots of information here so i'm just all ears at this point just trying to take it in and listen to you folks are what you do so i can try to get this to in the hands of the right people here.
rep,sure probably uh you know i can speak a little more about some of the solutions we have since you mentioned you know there are typically the ...... to give a fair coverage of the kind of solutions we bring to the table particularly in the supply chain space there are two solutions which we haven't .. phase one is for optimization suite and another is a demand forecasting suite so both kind of fall back into the white box analytics that i i was talking about earlier.
rep,the optimization suite is a is a generic business solution in terms of what kind of problems it can solve.
rep,it can solve a network optimization problem it can solve a production optimization problems.
rep,it could be for inventory optimization or it could be used for spend optimization.
rep,any user in the supply chain should be able to use this optimizer to be able to given their cost parameters optimize their cost figure out given interest about their constraints and you know play around with it.
rep,the reason why we think this is different from a lot of optimizers available in the market is of course there are the likes of a ilog in the market right but again what they really need to be operational in an organization is the presence of a data scientist.
rep,so we're trying to take away that dependency really here.
rep,so like i said this is a pre-built generic optimization algorithm.
rep,the optimization doesn't necessarily have to be you know the standard operations researching linear optimization it could be a nonlinear one.
rep,the optim- uh we have multiple algorithms built into this course of solution so it could either be the typical linear problem or it could be a nonlinear problem right so in which case you have a ..heuristic.. algorithm built into it.
rep,so since the data science part is already taken care of the only effort required in being able to address "a"  pointed problem is a initial consulting kind of a bid which is you know typically four to six weeks where we try to understand your cost parameter help you aggregate that data in the form in format that the solution can take in sorry ensure the optimization problem phrased right that we have to fill the right optimization the right equation to be optimized we have put in the right business constraint ensured that all business scenarios are covered in the business constraints ensuring that constraints are mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive and all of that right.
rep,so that's why that is the consulting exercise rather to ensure that there is sufficient domain expertise being brought in to formulate the problems itself and ensuring the right cost parameters are going in.
rep,and once that is done probably in case the standard visualizations which we have as part of this tool if that is not sufficient for a particular business to analyze deep enough we kind of customize the visualizations as well. so if we look at it step by step what is done is once the cost parameter have been a you know modeled into the solutions  the  business users have simulators with them which they can play around with you know modify the values which are part of the business constraint get the results out the visualizations and the visualizations allow *deep drill down* analysis so that you know they can evaluate between scenarios and select the right scenario for the decision.
rep,and like i mentioned this could right now as we use the present straight set for network optimization production makes the example that i spoke about earlier was executed using this solution so for the customer as we spoke about it was not just about the you know identifying the right location for the distribution center it was also about figuring out whether that location should be a distribution center or a assembly unit right.
rep,so there is a much more deeper network designing aspect to it it's not just about the location its about what should be the configuration of that location and what should be the overall configuration of the network for the next problem we try to solve in the same suite of figuring out you know if it should be hub-and-spoke model or it should be a simple configuration and if it is a hub-and-spoke what is the simple configuration what kind of transportation mode would optimize the cost order right. so by so by ensuring the initial consulting exercise the real benefit can be taken out of the tools because you can either formulate the problem statement to be as ... so that we can address much more problems than you know just a simple one like you know identify the location.  so this is one of our solutions and any questions here again kevin.
prospect,no i don't have any questions. this is a lot of information really good information and i'm looking forward to passing it on to our our procurement folks to see where you know they might best fit this thing in our organization to see if there's a current need and what i would like to do is forward this presentation on to them and james had sent me i think an email that kind of introduced your company and all four units as well is a follow up and they're really the folks i think that are gonna they're gonna need to take a look at this.
rep,for myself personally a buying area is you know i don't i don't see i don't see us using you folks per se but that's not somebody else would not so i work in a small carved out section for reverse logistics of the pharmacy side it's a smaller part of the business but in the overall scope of supply chain what i'll do is send this information to the procurement purchasing guy that has responsibility over all of supply chain and have them take a look at that i'll copy copy james on this as well.
prospect,in case you have any questions further questions we can definitely take in.
prospect,i think i think that's what we do here is it i think that's that's the best approach here but i think it's great this is a wonderful presentation and i really appreciate you folks calling and reach it out to us. where are you folks located california? yea we are based out of santa clara kevin. ok. do you have experience in the in the retail space?
rep,absolutely kevin. yeah we didn't speak about this content because we thought you really would be more interested in supply chain space.  we do work extensively in the retail space as well so be it in store related analytics like we have already mentioned here shelf page optimization or you know the product assortment.
rep,i work in the home office for a retailer you know the head quarters for a retailer fairly significant design.
rep,so yeah we're all about retailing so it really comes in stores the distribution centers.
rep,absolutely and from a retail perspective we do a fair bit of work in the marketing and sale side as well. do you think it would add value for us to yo u know like send you some stuff around that as well then you can send it to the procurement. do you think it'll add more value.
prospect,nah i don't think. i am good.
prospect,i'm good with the information that you provide this is great.
next steps and action items,fantastic kevin if you probably if you don't mind if you could introduce us to the procurement folks and you know like in case they have questions that we don't have to bother you and you know we can
prospect,thank you folks for calling and setting up the call.
rep,thank you kevin thank you for your time.
rep,thank you very much.
prospect,thank you bye.
rep,glenn this is karthik here from brillio.
rep,hi how are you?.
prospect,hey i'm doing good.
rep,thank you so much and thank you for taking time for a call.
rep,we have our rakesh and anuj from brillio.
rep,i think rakesh is just joining in good morning its rakesh.
rep,hey rakesh good morning.
rep,hey glenn good morning how are you?.
prospect,good very good.
rep,glen thank you so much for taking this call.
rep,i really appreciate and apologies for not being here earlier i was winding up another call.
rep,perfect so glen you know let me just get started by introducing myself and my colleague andrew who will also join the call.
rep,so glen my name is rakesh i am based out of new jersey and i run the complete north east business portfolio for brillio managing all our retail cpg customers and my role is primarily to be the one who's kind of talking to clients like you and kind of introducing brillo and what work we do.
rep,i will also be joined by andrew on the call.
rep,andrew you are you there?.
rep,yeah i'm here.
rep,oh yeah good morning andrew.
rep,so glen andrew is our senior cum partner with brillio and  he comes with deep domain expertise in retail and cpg and you know i wanted him to join the call with me so that between both of us i think in the first 30 minutes we can give you a great introduction of who we are and what we do.
rep,all right very good thank you.
rep,so i think glen you would have received the deck that the team had shared right maybe a few minutes back.
rep,so you can keep it as a reference.
rep,so i think giving you a brief introduction of brillio so we have been now in the business for most four years.
rep,it's been a great journey so far for us.
rep,you know we've been growing exceptionally well and currently we are headquartered in santa clara with our second largest operation in new jersey or globally we operate out of 10 offices close to 2600 associates now across the globe and you know we take a lot of pride to say that we work with almost 30 fortune500 companies across the globe doing multiple different works right.
rep,i think from just to give you a little bit of a background right when we started three years backthe biggest question was to say hey you know there are so many players out there so what is it that really will bring or do differently where we can carve out a niche for ourselves right.
rep,so i think with that thought process in mind two service area that we chose to be aggressively focused on and that was digital and data transformation for our customers and primary reason we chose digital and data transformation glen was the fact that you know this is the area where i think us being small or being a start-up mode is not a handicap.
rep,other know without it kind of becomes an advantage for us right because in this two particular areas our clients saw there was a huge demand for having a partner that is moving as fast as the technology changes are moving in this space and you know who is there on top of the technology curve helping the customer understand what potentially they can do differently from what they have been doing to kind of address maybe the same or existing problem right.
rep,i think the speed of operation became a key differentiating factor for us and that kind of you know pushed us ahead and the second one of course our ability to kind of continuously keep looking at what is the technology offering that is coming in the future and how that is going to impact us and our clients right.
rep,so the eye on the future was another key thing that we have a very strong focus on and the kind of way we aligned ourselves we wanted to give these two things to our customers right.
rep,so with quickest time to respond and also always making sure the services that we offer are on the top of line from our technology standpoint.
rep,i think those two work very well for us and you know we have been growing decently well.
rep,if you move on to slide number three that's where you'll get a sense of what brillio does for its clients across the globe right.
rep,i will start out with the left hand moves corner and thats a very exciting so it's offering and we call it brillio imagine. and as part of brillio imagine glenn i think our focus is to kind of do what we call is a co innovation you know exercise or design exercise.
rep,it varies in flavors but the ideas this is kind of four to six weeks exercise where we kind of hear from our clients what is the problem they're trying to solve.
rep,we quickly bring in the right experts around that.
rep,we do a solutioning there and at the end i think as compared to the other traditional consulting exercise the end of our imagine exercise is never a nice powerpoint or a nice word document right.
rep,the way we kind of always plan our imagine exercise its focus on making sure we ending it up with a working prototype or a proof-of-concept which our customers can use touch and feel and see exactly how it's impacting the business right.
rep,so the thought process around developing a mobile app for mastercard or be it around solving some of the customer and consumer related challenges that we faced for likes of red bull and paper source right.
rep,the idea is as part of this exercise understand the problem think of a solution to a pilot and give something very tangible and working to our customers right.
rep,so this is where our senior experts both from the technology and business side come together to kind of work on a rapid pace.
rep,so that's where brillio imagine comes into play.
rep,then as we move along then comes our next service offering which is our digital experience as we call it and primarily it is more like saying hey when you have build those experiences and your that imagine exercise you build the prototype.
rep,how do i take it and scale it up to the become a  enterprise-wide solution right where i'm thinking the right level of you know design thinking right level of ui ux building the whole be it the portal be it the mobile app be it analytical solution which are of the marketing or the business teams are going to use.
rep,we're kind of bringing everything to lives and getting it ready.
rep,then comes our third business offering which i think is the key and i think we have seen our most conversations happening on this space with a lot of our clients which is primarily our big data and analytics service offering right glen.
rep,this is split into two parts just broadly to give you a sense so we have our big data store offering or big data technology service offering which is primarily to do with how do i start our clients onto the new journey of the this whole big data integration building those data layers building advanced analytical foundations if we may call right.
rep,getting all the data from multiple places integrated together and have it ready at a massive scale for customers quickly.
rep,this is where we kind of have our service offering around governance around advanced visualization making sure the right reporting and - dashboarding is built so on and so forth.
rep,but a second part to the service offering is our advanced analytics and this is where i think is where clients get very excited because here we are talking about how once you have this data from multiple sources right what are the different ways of kind of building those advanced analytical and statistical model on top of it be it using the regression which is a traditional one or be using something called a hidden markov model which our lot of our clients are now using and how do i build those complex analytical model and make it in such a way that its are generating some actionable insights to the sales team or the marketing team across our client portfolio.
rep,so that they can start making those decisions right.
rep,so this is where we have our team of data scientist and advance statistician who are really working and kind of trying to understand the data and build those advanced models.
rep,and last but not the least is our service offering from a engineering standpoint right.
rep,so having talked so much about what we do in digital and data space i think the key thing here is glen the way you design or build the systems for our clients that that need to be new-age that needs to be looking at something which is out there from a cloud standpoint from a software as a solution standpoint or you know how do i bring in the whole concept of new way of engineering using agile and devops build together so that whatever i do and build for my customers is kind of done it the fastest possible time and with the highest accuracy keeping the future in ming right.
rep,so that's where our digital engineering operations offering come into play and that's what we have been doing.
rep,so that kind of gives you a brief overview of what we do from an end-to-end standpoint and i think cpg retail is one of our largest customer portfolio group followed by banking and financial services and then energy and utility where we do a lot of work with our clients.
rep,with this glen i will take any questions.
prospect,yeah of these four buckets or pillars that you pretty much describing of your expertise which ones which one or two would you say you're really invested in this versus your competition.
rep,so at this point in time as i speak from a purely customer reference point right if i use that as a reference point us to where customers have been engaging brillio the most i would put big data and analytics as one of our spear head in terms of what we have been doing and the kind of work that we are doing our customers just love it and even through the scale of the accenture csp those niche analytical formatting brillio is right up there.
rep,and the second one that i would pick from these serving offering is the complete digital experience work that they've been doing with our client.
rep,so on those two i think primarily i see our clients getting very very excited about what we do and how we kind of approach it.
rep,i'm not counting imagine in here glenn because imagine it more like a design thinking more like a pilot's more like an starting engagement but from a pure service offering i think big data and analytics is the first one and digital experience is the second one.
rep,great so i think i will hand it over to you andrew to kind of give an overview of how we kind of engages retailer over to you.
rep,thanks rakesh.
rep,yeah glen i didn't get a introduce myself but you and i are connected on linkedin and i did a bit of research and so i used to work at walgreens under adam.
rep,we're launching at the balance rewards program.
rep,so i feel like our path across probably a few times.
rep,so so yeah so and i'm working <not clear > alastair and so my background is it just give you some context on kind of how a lot of these different types of experiences all come together and you know used to work is done humvee then i was at walgreens and then i went overseas working in retail analytics over at australia with woolworths.
rep,i did some work actually with hershey in either confection teams there and then i have actually just recently moved have actually just recently moved back to chicago.
rep,so you have this high it's kind of a hybrid um can you hear me or that noise?.
prospect,here is much yeah no i mean there is little bit of static but i can hear you.
rep,let me try.
rep,i'm not sure whose phone it is.
rep,yeah its kind of getting a little bad.
rep,okay i'm not sure whose it is but let's be patient.
rep,we're just kind of go on.
rep,so we have this kind of hybrid team right where we've got people who are you know have a lot of experience within engineering and heavy heavy data engineering big data analytics machine learning ai but then will be started to build out as a bit as a bit of a practice with this let us call it the tip of the iceberg which is someone like myself and a few other individuals who are from that imagine group and from the called the digital business services group who are a bit more of that management consulting arms or managing the relationship as well as kind of demonstrating the realm of what's possible to potentially do a small prototype engagement but then also doing you know we have longer longer term partnerships or pool dedicated versus on certain client.
rep,so we've got a kind of a range of engagements in a range of types types of specialities.
rep,one of the kind of explain how someone like myself with my background fits into fits into this type of technology.
rep,so looking at slides for the intent of this slide is just to show you a bit of the range of the types of products and neighbors that we have.
rep,they don't all sit with in retail cpg but what i've highlighted here most the only left-hand side are mostly retail our breath the breath of our retail cpg products.
rep,so the top left hand side we have pricing solution that actually recognized by gartner so quite a strong solution there.
rep,top right hand side we are we have a product called shelf scanner you might have heard of a product called tracks which is also in the market so we're that's their direct competitor of ours and that is a that is a product we will talk little bit.
rep,it is a you take a photo on shelf and recognizes it recognizes products and converts the text and you can do a range of field audit optimisation through that.
rep,going down below shelf scanner we've got market and promotion mix modeling below that optic or reduce forecasting and then you know at the bottom looking at ella this is just for chip an example you know we also beyond the typical cpg retail like let's just say like merchandising solution we also do a lot of work with like marketing and customer service where we do a lot of conversion of voice to text to do diagnostics on you know customer service teams and whether it might be pain points and that's there's types of teams and how do you address them upstream.
rep,and then on the right hand side is a bit more of the data component but we do you know we have our own data platform that we run a lot of our products off of.
rep,we do a lot of different types of you know we have our own testing mobile platforms and security platforms as well.
rep,so again its intent is that it's not just it's not just solution on the solution side we also have run kind of data platform decide that a lot of these products and sit on and we can do a lot of testing on as well.
rep,going to number five just give you an idea we we work with some of your direct competitors as well as indirect we've got you shivani unilever you also have nestle on there j&j hines l'oreal.
rep,and then we also do some work whether it's it's been an ad hoc or whether it's on going with us foods trader joe's walmart as well.
prospect,all right.
rep,statics pretty loud.
rep,you guys if you could put on mute that would be quite helpful.
rep,going to spot six hmm so i guess the question you might have and work on the cpg you have any questions so far?.
rep,i was gonna go a little bit in where you you know what's the ask or where do we fit into maybe what you guys are doing.
prospect,no i'm good.
rep,oh cool so we've talked a little bit about some capabilities on slide 6 so far.
rep,quickly cuz i feel like you got a pretty good grasp over going at this but go starting the top right you know we're typically engaged with the way the our typical engagements work is we typically have a digital imagine digital strategy exercise.
rep,we're basically doing let's just call it co management consulting exercise we're basically saying you know to find the problem what's going on during digital road and kind of doing a roadmap of where do we need to be supporting that type of business and based on what the problems and concerns are.
rep,we think about what the business solutions what business rule issues are most relevant it's a solution if the day turnkey solution that we need to give to them and they just run it themselves or is it something that we support them with training them over to make something that's bespoke based on their needs.
rep,but the data engineering and advanced visualization side typically we'll do any type of data restructuring that we do or business or so we do it will typically make something that is going to be a very user friendly i think that's a big strength of ours at all that we get a lot of really strong feedback on.
rep,and then on the big data analytics and data science side that's what we you have probably a lot more of our i'd say i describe it's like quite clever ai machine learning type of work beyond the typical pricing solutions that you see in the market from like the <not clear> the world.
rep,like we're we're overlaying a lot more of the self-taught machine learning capabilities which i think a lot of other companies even like rei or trying to come on that come along but the fact that we're small and we don't have a lot of these products fully established in the market yet with an advantage of ours whereas a lot of those types of companies have pricing tool that in the markets that are understood by everyone so that that that migration over to a different tool was probably going to be a bit harder than it is for us.
rep,and then with business consulting side that's just an example of how we kind of have these ongoing ongoing partnerships with dedicated teams for businesses.
rep,so for the sake of time i guess i just wanted to jump to slide 9 and then i want to just maybe have a little bit of conversation what we think could be next so do you have slide 9 in front of you?.
prospect,yep i do now.
rep,so what i wanted to do in slide 9 is highlight you know we're throwing a lot of stuff at you in 20 minutes.
rep,i just want to give you a bit of a flavor for the types of work that we're doing with work that we're doing with other other partners and the kind of breadth that it covers because it's not just a you know we're not like a pricing we're not like a pricing shop where we only do price and we don't only do promotion expertise.
rep,we have a lot of different we have a lot of different cool technologies that cover a lot of different applications across different you know not just merchandising but also field team support as well.
rep,so when we go through these and then you know think about where this gets a little bit much relevant an interesting topic part.
rep,so one of our products is shelf scanner so what wherever this shelf scanner is it it's an image recognition product that basically a field team support goes into a store with your mobile device take a picture of a photo take a foot take a photo of the shelf.
rep,essentially our ai and machine learning capability behind this product it actually does recognize its color price all any type of brands information promotion activity and obviously you've planted with planogram comparison.
rep,if that planogram was available and uploaded but it's planogram comparison it basically runs a you know diagnostic debate to say you know what the shelf availability is if items are missing if items are replaced and essentially all those activities that still your field to support would be doing.
rep,it's essentially like a recommendation engine that's optimizing a lot of those activities and saving a ton of time for those teams in store.
rep,so we tested a few of those my consent over this case studies as well but um that's probably one of our most admits baits one of our most kind of game-changing tools and that it's quite disruptive .
rep,so it's typically been done and it's saving tons of time and rather than doing what you might think is like you know how much time does a field team member after like spend in store to be doing that planning a grammar shelf shelving read versus if you'll have to choose of all op so i'll choose twenty twenty walgreens the basis sample off of compliance.
rep,d but you can this time you better do go from 20 to 100 that you actually go into or you can do still do 20 and then based off those pictures you could do a lot more than bus analytics to project out what the compliance be the more accurate level.
rep,voice of customer is something that we're seeing a lot of traction not just in this cpg space but also in the in the beep-beep-beep space and that or able to do is there's two sides this one is from a customer service side you're able to do voice to text conversion of nlp they call it.
rep,but you're also able to order also to do is it's also an online web scraping product that you could basically see across all types of food blogs and various social blogs that we have mapped to all types of scraping to understand sentiment for your product competitors products for even retailers and understand kind of hows what are the pros and cons of this product what are people saying on it's an input innovation promotion activity and other things as well.
rep,opt appraised is something that is it's a pricing solution that microsoft is actually it's actually one of microsoft preferred pricing solutions that they are going to they're they're they're partners with so we're preferred partner of microsoft and they're actually using our pricing solution that's kind of based on you know and they have talking to clients on line to the pricing issues they're basically referencing ours as the go-to solution.
rep,so we've seen a lot of success with that within cpg as well as with and that's and that's for like merchandising and jesus we still can you still hear me? i can yeah.
rep,all right thanks for being here guys.
rep,so on the pricing side there's two components one is you know we do basically price pricing diagnostics but we also also to do is develop you know pricing simulators that you can put in the hands of account teams at various retailers and it's basically is you know real-time pricing trade trade negotiation trade optimization - also you know based on the conversations i having a category manager you've been putting a lot of different scenarios and it's real time spitting out you know margin and what what you need to be making and tracked and it's almost a bit more of a across the team they would be tracked there's not a different modules within that tool.
rep,and then from the data science side this is more of a service but one of the things that we've seen a lot of success with and you know a lot of companies are afraid to outsource their work and are trying to bring more things in-house which is understandable because based on you know how that how they want to approach their business and they might think it's more sustainable and so one of the things that we've had a lot of success in is pay rather than you know hiring us to be doing all the work for you we can set up an engagement where it's more of a let us train let us upskill you and you know build out that analytic team whether it could be building ai functionality within your team or it could be building segmentation implementing into your existing products.
rep,there's a lot of that's more of a service side but it's something that we do as well.
rep,so i guess what's next would be the question and slide ten captures that a little bit where you know we don't typically say hey if you're interested in x it costs you know how many thousand dollars but what i want to pick their brain on is you know based on what you're hearing in slides and seeing in slide nine is there something that is of more interest and if there is what i prefer to do is just have another call where you and i can connect or i'm happy to come up to you guys offices and just basically walk through what that solution is if it already exists or what could something look like based on you guys needs are because i would think it's impossible if i were in your shoes to say ask you the question of alright like which one you want to buy but it's more of what are you most interested in where's where's the most relevant and we could kind of you know i'm able to come up there i can understand kind of your business needs a bit as well i don't have to use it that's i mentioned it before i got on the call but but i didn't really get full visibility into and work another conversation is you know what are your kpis for the year what are you within that mark within that larger format space what do you guys trying to be struggling with what you guys trying to solve.
prospect,yeah so just kind of a backdrop on some of the hershey company and a little bit of history call it since i had moved off of walgreens business.
prospect,let me i moved into an international role with the hershey company as we set forth the strategy to expand more globally.
prospect,we've somewhat retracted back from our international markets and rather than seeking growth there were refocused back on the us business.
rep,i came back over the us business probably about a year ago and it was a post reorganization.
rep,so all at hershey?.
prospect,i'm sorry?.
rep,was that all at hershey the whole time or were you based someone else.
prospect,yeah no so i was in hershey is in part of like a center of excellence type of role rest and primarily the countries that i worked with was mexico and china where we had a focus on continuing to build out the business and then we also did some work in india and saudi arabia but as we kind of retracted back in we hired some consultants to kind of help us work through the reorg.
prospect,coming back to the us business it was a lot different though i see the organization now focused on building capabilities with revenue growth management.
prospect,we're in the process of transitioning from nielsen over to iri and with that were we're using them and a suite of tools that they have to help us enable and unlock i'd say more margin for both the hershey company but also the retailer.
prospect,that's most on the merchandising like vendor like cpg to retailer solutions right like kind of collaboration? right but also i think helping some of our internal teams plan their promotions more effectively and where we have partners or pillars will you know we're obviously still leveraging a lot of the loyalty data that's out there as well.
prospect,we've seen immense call it pressure in the marketplace from i think not only cpg but retailing and you know as i reflect or look back at even walgreens is gone through a significant amount of change in their leadership and management.
prospect,i know mindy i still there from from that perspective and loyalties still discussed but i'd say it's not key pillars that it used to be.
rep,however yeah.
prospect,i yeah.
prospect,so i say the other thing you know as i look at the business ecommerce has picked up a lot more momentum and isn't acting the trips to brick-and-mortar and that's some of the complaints that we heard here from working with our retailers.
prospect,yeah i mean we're there looking to uncover any growth as they can and we're seeing center store shrink and primarily consumer behavior patterns change and people are looking to eat healthier.
prospect,there's thinner store is shrinking and the perimeter of the store is is growing but then we're also seeing leakage going to other non-traditional areas outside of the store.
prospect,yeah so a lot of that stuff is putting pressure on the group so when i look at call it and i'm on slide nine just looking at the portfolio of options that it it feels like you kind of pulled forward to a here's what a lot of our cpg retail partners are looking at today.
prospect,you know i will say we are fine-tuning our business model again it kind of course correct from what we've done two years ago we cut too deep in some areas and probably not enough and in other areas so the only - my ask would be you know don't think there's any one component that you have that really stands out to me from where we're at at this point in time in his organization but we're about to go through some tweaking again so i would say okay let's let's have a conversation probably in about a month or a month and a half from now so i could i could give you better visibility to where the dust is going to settle as to how we're going to go after it i will say we are and this is where you know obviously there's some potential with data you know there's no shortage of data that's out there.
prospect,i think one of the challenges that we've got to be able to do is to sit through what what we see from the whole omni-channel experience and and where we want to compute at that in play for areas of growth.
prospect,i'm not sure if you have e-commerce platforms and or solutions but i think that's an area that we're going to continue to invest not not that we're not going to invest in traditional brick and mortar retailer but it's an area that a lot many retailers continue to talk to us about as.
rep,asking you guys for recommendations and guidance.
prospect,no because the e-commerce piece is really it becomes an endless aisle though i mean their biggest request from us is really give us the right landing page in the product images got it gets put in stuff like that to make sure that it's a good representation to the customer.
rep,just think.
prospect,so you know for us we it's just an area that we have to pivot and that see many retailers because consumers are gravitating toward digital you just have to play in that space so i mean i know even at you know just reflecting back to the walgreens experience it's like a common linkage you know eater mark ecommerce size for typical cpg was only like 1 to 2% so it wasn't significant.
prospect,where we do and you had mentioned i think mastercard before we do work with a data analytics firm apt out of washington dc which does a lot of tests and learns for us.
prospect,so it's just a move we do have our our hands and a lot of different buckets so that's just you know as i think through what some of the biggest opportunities are for us continue to drive profitable sales.
rep,i realize you can touch that as much and it's good knowledge expressions little bit more than some of the stuff that we do with ecom only or how we've helped some retailers or speed and be calm.
rep,but um i also want i'll send over a bit of a specific deck that talks about shelf scanner i think the one thing to kind of go away with on the shelf scanner side is this is an area and i'd even talked to some of the guys at uic and iri and so on just in touch with them just extra time few days and that whole ai and like image recognition which i mean there's a ton of money left on shelf as far as out of stock shell availability planogram compliance and especially if you're able to you know save forty percent of time and you're like sales your in-store field audit seems there's a lot of from a revenue management side money that can be saved through these types of these types of tools and they can be saved quite quickly so something to think about and these aren't things that take you four five six months to do there's things that there's things that we can test in four weeks you know max.
rep,so in front of prices side i think you'd be quite surprised as far as how we do our pricing because we're a bit we're a bit more of returning to these products to market were a bit more flexible as far as you know based based on the return of you're going to get we build into price quite competitively in order to get that product to market and demonstrate it to value the long term.
prospect,okay all right very good.
rep,appreciate the time is good give me a good connect.
prospect,all right thank you very much.
rep,thank you glenn thanks andrew.
rep,hello.
prospect,hello.
prospect,hi this is darren sorry i'm late.
rep,no not a lot of problem darren.
rep,hi darren this is gautham here from freshdesk.
rep,how are you doing today.
prospect,i'm doing well and how are you.
rep,i'm great thank you so much for asking.
rep,so i had a conversation with your account manager renuka and she actually put me up for this demonstration today. so i'd be taking you through the demonstration of freshdesk.
prospect,oh great.
rep,allright and darren before we you know jump into the demonstration and you know like to ask a couple of questions to try understanding you know the workflow that you follow there which will give me a better understanding of you know which are may be the support channels or what are the pain points that you know like you're facing right now for for which you know freshdesk would solve that solution for you right.
rep,so just a couple of quick questions there so.
rep,currently darren what is the process that you follow there with the customer support as such.
prospect,well my business partners in new zealand and australia their company utilizes freshdesk already so they just want to integrate it to me to integrate it into their software and i guess the that's the sprout platform so they've got a paid version.
rep,yep yep.
prospect,and so i just need to get set up is within a within administration rights and then they're going to go in and set it up with their software and and train me on using it.
rep,sure sure.
rep,you know definitely that sounds like a plan.
rep,and so currently darren what are the various ways in which you know the customers reach out to you at this point there.
prospect,so it's we make contact lenses and so they order on using their software and then it goes to a website that i get notified that there's an order to be manufactured so then i manufacture the order and i ship the product to the to the customer.
rep,alright okay.
prospect,if they have a if they have a question about or the need to redesign a contact lens then they type a comment in and that generates an email that goes to me and then i go in and i look at the information online and i make changes and i design any lens.
rep,aright alright so basically you have a website from which your customers reach out to you right and in case they are looking for maybe a change in the lens or any such results they would add a comment on the website is it.
prospect,exactly correct.
rep,alright so basically i reckon that you would have a form on your website which they would be filling up which will now come in to which will notify you in the form of an email data.
rep,all right all right so and that that's that's form which they fill would be your you know the email that comes into you which you'll be using that for you know going about the order.
rep,am i right in assuming that workflow is what that you currently use there.
rep,sure perfect all right you know thank you so much for sharing that and apart from that so do you see any pain points in your current workflow that you have which you think you know your healthcare system would be a better way you know to go about things.
prospect,yeah i think that if i could give so that we make contact lenses for eye doctors and so when the eye doctor has a question they may instead of using the form they may email email me and so whether they send just their email client to send me an email or whether the they type a comment on the form on our website that then generates an email to me i would like those emails to come to me so then i know that there's work and items that needs to be an email to me i would like those emails to come to me so then i know that there's work and items that needs to be addressed.
rep,sure you know completely makes sense thank you so much for sharing that darren and that gives me quite a bit of relevance into you know the couple of features that i could demonstrate to you over the course of this and yep so i think we can jump into the call but you know darren i think i i'll also be sharing my screen so do have the access to you know log into the system where you're able to view my screen there darren.
prospect,i'm looking at the email let's try yes lets try this.
rep,yep i think you'd have a in you know a zoom link that would ask you to download to zoom for the purpose of you know logging into it.
rep,yeah exactly there you go.
rep,all right let me begin to share my screen out there now darren and if you can confirm to me if you're able to view my screen.
rep,so let's you know jump into the demonstration now and freshdesk is in fact a customer support enabling tool that will let you you know integrate your various support channels in one single platform so that you know you have all your queries coming in together in a single organized manner which will enable you better tracking and also to follow up on these emails that come into the system right so.
rep,would freshdesk in fact the primary support channel that we offer is of course the email channel which is basically you know going to be the email address that you know to which your either your customers reach out to you or it could be the doctors who you manufacture the lenses for so you can have that support email configured here so that every time these doctors or your customers write out an email to this specific support email that comes into the system in the form of a ticket which with a certain ticket id number against it and you know so that you can assign an agent or yourself to handle them with in with a respect to these tickets so that that will enable better track right.
rep,so that's one of the primary support channels that we offer so let me take you now to a lifecycle of a ticket so typically i will i'll do a quick roll play where i'll assume to be either one of you know maybe ask one of the eye doctors who reach out to you through a support email and let's see as an agent what are the various you know the actions that you could perform on these tickets and which rules and you can also see couple of benefits of using a helpdesk system to go about this interaction right.
rep,all right sure so let me you know shoot out and test email so like how you do have a support email there similarly i do have one set up for myself and that is where i'd be writing into so i'll say that this you know what are the typical types of you know the queries which you do get in your system there darren. so maybe the doctors reach out to you ordering  the power of a lens or you know things like that.
rep,sure so i'll say order for a lens right.
rep,so say.
rep,so i'm just hypothetically picking up the scenario here.
rep,alright so if this happens to be the email which your doctor sends out to you so typically they would send it as an email it says which is the current way in which they be going about the task and now from an agent's perspective that's on the tickets tab that you see here is where you'd be receiving these various email in the form of tickets that come into the system.
rep,right so here if you see i have the email that i shot out right now coming into the system where this is the subject of the email that i sent this will let you know who the requester or who's it from you receive this email from and of course it comes along with the timestamp of when the specific email was sent right.
rep,so now as an agent what you could do is you can enter into the ticket to view various other aspects of it and let me try explaining them one by one.
rep,so the first thing that you could do is you have you can reply back to this ticket you have the option to forward this ticket or add a note so let me explain these actions so typically for the straight workflow you will be responding back to this email address to this email that they shot out so they you know he says that he's trying to reach out to look for ordering the length and please give me a call back so you could say sure you know will you please suggest a date and time right and if this happens to be the response that you sent back to your the doctor who sent that out and for you it's going to be part of a ticket thread over here right and now from a customer's perspective for the person who raised this query it will be it will look like a continuation of the same email address that they shot out right so here if you see this was the initial email address which they sent and that came with the response that you sent them up.
rep,and so typically what you could do is once you send send this response back to them you can update the status maybe saying something like you know you're awaiting on your customers response right.
rep,so this will give you more of a relevance into you know where is what is the status of the ticket or for that matter it will let you you know give you a better understanding of who who's who court the ball is in which will give you an understanding of whether it is you who have to respond now or you're waiting for a response from your customer right.
rep,so typically this is the way you could go about tracking these various issues and what you could also do here is there a couple of other ticket properties as such that you could you know append.
rep,let's say for example you can have various types of these queries that come in so one could be something like an order request one could be something like let's say a feedback or you know various other options that you could have for yourself because as and when these come in you can update these properties and save them because later in case maybe if you're pulling out reports out of the system based on these types of issues that you've got you would be able to do that right.
rep,so it would later on help you in with pulling our reports if you're looking to have them.
prospect,and that's what i think that they currently do where we've got our own knowledge base or with resources for our customers and so they can go in and they can link send replies that includes a link to those resources.
rep,exactly exactly i think one that you're referring to would be something similar to a customer support portal that you can enable which you can in fact make it look like an extension of your website itself so that you know when even when your customers reach out to you through your website and we can have various faqs populated such as what you see here on the solution steps so these are nothing but pretty much the various faqs or solution articles that you could populate on your customer portal itself which will enable them to come and search the these queries for themselves right.
rep,so if they type in something like a keyword which is order the system would search for these articles that you uploaded based on these keywords and pull them out for them pull it out for them.
rep,right so i think this is typically how you can do this and apart from the other advantage of having a customer support portal such as this is like how you have it on your website you can also have a similar font set up on the customer support portal itself such as this and even here in fact when they're you know typing in their query or trying to submit a ticket you the system still pulls out the solution articles if you got you know keywords based on the text that you entered so that this would still you know stop them from sending a ticket where you basically empower your customers to handle these queries for themselves.
prospect,so it sounds like yeah this is all making sense is how how it goes together so now i just need to have you show me how to get a set up where i can set up my my business partner so he can have administrative rights to go in and link it to theirs.
rep,perfect you know that sounds like a plan there darren and i also understand that you currently already do have an account set up with you know that says i space us dot process com so would you like to continue with this url or would you like to create a new account for yourself right now.
prospect,no i think this we'll use this one.
rep,sure you can do that and i also see that you know with there that there's been yeah you've been added as an agent case i reckon that you are signed up for the system so you already do have the admin rights to this so in case maybe what but what you can do right now you know darren is you can share your screen where either you can log into your system and i can help you add these other agents and provide administrator access to them so that you know they can help you get the system set up the fact that sounds alright with you.
prospect,yeah that'd be perfect.
rep,all right let's do that then so i'll just stop my screen share so now you can begin to share your screen and we'll go about the setup darren.
rep,great.
rep,so you will see the.
rep,that's say-.
rep,yep you can click on the on the green color widget that says share screen.
prospect,so i got a freshdesk .
rep,ah not freshdesk so your url would be i space us dot freshdesk dot com.
rep,perfect so.
prospect,i've gotten all setup go ahead.
rep,and that's alright cuz that that's basic of a dashboard that you know lets you know what of a couple of things that you can set up so now are you looking to maybe add charles as an agent into the system.
prospect,exactly correct yes.
rep,all right perfect so what do you can do now is click on admin okay admin that you see on yeah right there and click on agents yep.
rep,a new agent.
rep,a new agent that you see on the top right corner.
rep,right there.
rep,all right so you know there are a couple of mandatory fields here one being the name and of course the email address.
prospect,okay i'm just looking at my email on my phone to get charles email okay.
rep,would you like me to help you out with that.
prospect,yeah that's awesome.
rep,yeah just give me a moment i'll pick that up.
rep,all right it says c h a r l charl  @ innocon dot co dot co dot za.
prospect,dot z.
rep,a.
rep,alright so now you can you can define which is the role that you would like to associate charles with and typically would you also like to give him the plans and billing access that's good you know basically that you will have access to the the credit card information is that all right.
prospect,yes absolutely.
rep,all right sure.
prospect,give access to everything.
rep,perfect in that case you can just scroll down a bit now and you'll have this option that says associate rules yes you can give him the rights for an account administrator in that case.
prospect,yeah perfect.
rep,it's just enough if you give the account administrator because that works where you know all the access for an account administrator would be available for the rest of the ones too right.
prospect,okay great.
rep,so its like a bottom-up approach with respect to the various levels of access that you could have.
rep,all right click on assign and then the save.
rep,sure so now if you see an activation link has been sent to charles so once he clicks on that link and set up your password for himself he can he'll have complete access to your system.
prospect,fantastic.
rep,all right so apart from this darren i would you also maybe would you like me to help you set up your email base you know your support channel there to see if these tickets are coming in.
prospect,yeah that'll be great if you would.
rep,sure definitely let me do that so you know you can click back on the admin tab that you see there.
rep,yep and on email.
rep,all right so here by default if you see if they support that i space us space freshdesk dot com so what if you do is click on edit against that on the right side.
rep,yeah perfect.
rep,so here you can type in the email address under your support email so which is the email address to which you know either your customers reach out to you so is it a separate email address to it maybe your customers reach out to you and then the doctors or is it the same support address they enter.
prospect,everything goes into my gmail address and and so the question is it is it better to use i've also got one under my company that with the you saw earlier the darren at custom craft lens dot com so do you recommend i use that or that i use my gmail address.
rep,i would recommend you to have a support email address which is the former option that you suggested because that will give you a platform to which you know all your customers can reach out but you also do have the option when you're added as an agent for from your agents email address if you forward any of your emails which you get from your customers to your support email which is lens craft and that will too create it ticket in freshdesk but with the original sender as the requester of that email and not yourself right so if you go this setup or with the former one which you suggested you'll have both the options of you know having accessing your gmail account to create tickets as well as you know your support address so i would suggest that set up darren.
prospect,the custom craft lens.
prospect,okay okay yeah.
prospect,so is i'm just going to take out support and put in darren or no we'll do this so this would be my support email so that's good and then we will forward to this is the one i want to change.
rep,um yep so typically this forward is nothing but this forwarding rule must be added on your physical mailbox that you have so that that will forward tickets coming in to freshdesk so let me take you through the steps so what do you see under your support email is where you need to enter the end email you know the email to which your customers right into.
rep,apart from your gmail account the the alternate email that you help so which is that that says support at i space us dot com.
prospect,is it it's no it's everything goes to my gmail even the darren at custom craft lens dot com which is my company comes to my gmail address.
rep,all right so what i can suggest is maybe a you can have custom craft dot com created at your support email so that instead of those emails coming into your mailbox you can have them coming into freshdesk in the form of tickets right.
rep,yeah okay.
rep,all right so but i also see that you know this happens to be the agents email address too.
rep,alright so if this is the case you know there would be an internal loop created in the system when your support email as well as the agents email happens to be the same which will not lead to creating of tickets darren so ideally what i would suggest you is if this is the support email to which the customers reach out you can create this as your support email but from an agents perspective with the with with you know with the to do with the login message you can have an alternate email if that's alright.
prospect,yeah so the login email would be different.
rep,sure sure that'd be good you know change right after this so once you yep so if you have the setup you can click on save.
rep,all right and before we you know proceed further into configuring this i would suggest you to change your agent's email address from darren at custom craft lens dot com to any of the alternate emails and to do that you click on admin.
prospect,oh not.
rep,on not this on admin so this remains as it is this because this is the  email to which you know your customers reach out currently so you can click on admin again yep on agents yes and edit against darren nigrin yep so here you might need to be giving an alternate email id for you to for all the login purposes.
prospect,for login.
rep,yeah yeah so this is typically for logging in yeah yeah this make sense so now you click back and save and i think it will you know immediately log you out of the system because you've change the email from which to which you're logged in it says so that's alright so once you click on save.
prospect,okay hold on i want to change this one here.
prospect,actually we'll leave that as it is and add and this needs to be specific and then save.
rep,yep alright so typically you would have received an email address in fact right now it wouldn't accept it from here you would have received an email at that at at your gmail account that link will lead you to resetting your password and login with your system again.
prospect,and so.
rep,oh directly came in here is it.
rep,um if you can click back on that.
rep,just give me a moment you.
rep,sure yeah you could go ahead and click on that link.
rep,typically this shouldn't be the page but it's.
prospect,i don't know i think this the chrome i think the chrome browser autofills that.
rep,um alright um maybe if you could open your mailbox on an incognito mode and you know try use clicking on that link.
prospect,so open the email and another.
rep,yep on on an incognito mode.
rep,did that too lead you on to the page itself.
prospect,yep i think it think this is looks right.
rep,were you able to login to the system.
rep,all right so since it's on the incognito mode you know i wouldn't be able to view that so.
prospect,okay yeah yeah okay gotcha so we'll get out of the incognito.
prospect,and.
prospect,you can see the screen now.
rep,perfect darren perfect so now what you could do is copy this long address that you see which is says that that is under forwarded to yep all right so now you can log into this darren at customer craft lens dot coms mailbox to add this forwarding rule over there.
prospect,say that one more time.
rep,yeah so you can now log into darren at customer craft lens dot com your mailbox there and is that a gmail based mailbox network.
prospect,yeah it just gets forwarded as it set up through my domain to to forward all the emails so i don't ever log into darren at customer craft lens dot com everything goes to gmail.
rep,ah alright alright so darren at customer craft lens dot com isn't a physical mailbox it's more more of an alias to darren at no darren nigrin at gmail dot com.
prospect,that is correct it's more of an alias so my i'm through my the company that hosts my website i just go in and type in i can set up email boxes with my company domain and then they all get forwarded to wherever i tell it to get forwarded to.
rep,all right um so in that case maybe you could log in to or you know typically cuz darren at customer craft lens dot com the customer support email that you set up should typically be a physical mail box and not an alias darren is that's the best practice that we suggest going forward.
rep,you know like typically how over the mail they'd explained that you know sa uses something you know an alternate support email it says which i'm sure is a physical mailbox right so similarly you need to have a physical mailbox which did which should be your support email.
prospect,so then let's just use the darren nigrin at gmail.
rep,sure you can go ahead and create that itself as okay in that case again we might need to be changing the agent's email if that's all right yes i'm sorry i shouldn't have asked it's customer craft lens is a physical mailbox but since it's not is it alright for you to use an alternate emails for the login purposes apart from the gmail account so that we can set up you know darren nigrin at gmail dot com itself as your support email.
prospect,yeah so yeah we could use darren at custom craft lens com as my login right for freshdesk.
rep,um or more more so maybe something cuz since customer lens is still an alias of darren gmail dot com that might still lead to an internal loop of tickets being created which will not lead to the ticket itself being created darren.
rep,it's a little technical there so i would rather suggest as the best practice to have something as an alternate id for you to log in and for all purposes of your support email we can go ahead and configure darren nigren at gmail dot com there.
prospect,okay alright yeah i'm just thinking about how to do this and whether i'm going to set up another email because that's.
rep,um the other email that is okay other email for your support itself is it.
prospect,what's that.
rep,the other email would be for your support email or more for the login purpose you're talking about.
prospect,yeah login purpose so let's use my yahoo email address and for login.
rep,yeah that makes sense since yep you could use a yahoo account cuz typically that's what i do too because i use my yahoo account for in fact logging in as an support agent and i have a gmail account set up as my customer support email so that could be a perfect way that you could go about this set up.
rep,so what you can do now is you can click on edit and we can bring back the initial setup of darren nigrin at gmail dot com as your support email yep so on your support email yep that's where you enter darren nigrin at gmail dot com.
rep,alright save this and now we need to go back to admin and agents to yep update your agents email address and i'm sorry to you know that do this right now.
prospect,i need to do what.
rep,now you can click on edit against darren nigrin.
prospect,when i change this my yahoo.
rep,yeah yeah.
rep,save this and again it's a similar action that you would've received on on your yahoo account.
prospect,i'm just making notes so i know what my login is.
rep,here you go darren.
rep,so now what you could do is click on admin and emails so that we copy the long address email and you copy yeah right that and now you can log into darren your gmail account that is.
prospect,and how do i do this so how do i do this.
rep,alright now you log into your gmail account which is darren nigrin at gmail dot com.
rep,perfect so click on settings on the top right corner the one below that.
rep,the settings tab.
prospect,i'm just yeah i couldn't get to it because the window.
rep,yeah write that and click on settings again.
rep,the option below.
rep,and here you click on forwarding and pop i map as yep and you say you add a forwarding address yep enter in copy paste that.
rep,um i'm not sure if it's been added.
prospect,it says it's from forwarding address forwarding to gmail gmail com darren nigrin at i space dot us freshdesk dot com but it doesn't say gmail dot com it just says the gmail c o m.
rep,yep that's the long address which you know freshdesk system generates which is a unique address and that's not a problem but i don't see it reflecting under adding a adding a forward address here.
prospect,oh yeah now i see that.
rep,ok yep you can click on ok.
rep,ok so now you can you log into your helpdesk system again and on the tickets click on tickets yep so you have you have the forward confirmation here.
rep,so you have a code that here's the confirmation code you could copy that.
rep,the confirm the third line of the body of the email the confirmation code.
rep,yep and you can paste this code on the gmail there so that you know it's a two-way verification that happens.
rep,there you go and now you can you need to again click on forward a copy of incoming and save changes again cuz you know by default the gmail goes back to disable forwarding for some purpose.
rep,now you can click on save it alright so that's it you know now you have your your support email address up and running so let me just quickly test on this darren where let me quickly send out a test email to your support email that you have there right to see if there's you know if they're  getting tickets at freshdesk.
rep,all right so i'm writing now in to daren nygren did i get that right.
rep,all right at gmail dot com right i just sent the email and now you can click on the tickets tab again yeah all right there you see you get a new ticket the one above that if now it should be as part of your queue.
rep,so there you go so right now you have this email setup done so typically this is how you could go about doing it so the this is about the email setup as its done.
rep,so do you have any other workflows that you'd like to discuss and you know help me tell so that i could help you set that up for you right now.
prospect,do i have any other what.
rep,do you have any other workflows as such which you would like to discuss and see if freshdesk is a good fit so that you know you can have a so that i can help you set that up.
prospect,no i think that we're good right now i think what i'd like to do is since charles is is been using this system and is very comfortable with it he can get a set up to what the way he wants me to use it with their their product and then once i become comfortable i may like to expand it into my other the other aspect of my business.
rep,perfect perfect makes complete sense darren.
rep,so what i'd do right now darren is how do you like to take this forward cuz i understand that this trial i found that you have is it's a it's a free trial period that's available sometime until let me just check that out for you you're next when you face it until 26th of july right so will you be able to set set up this system within the next five days.
rep,all right sure that makes complete sense so once you do with the setup you know you can go ahead with the purchase and even during the course of the setup in fact if you have any queries you can directly shoot out an email to me and i'd be more than glad to help you darren.
prospect,okay very good and i'm not sure whether they said they had a paid product but charles will know whether or not i'm going to be part of that or whether i have to set up my own subscription or do i automatically have to set up my own subscription.
rep,sure no that's that's not that's not needed because in fact on the trial period all the pla- your account would be on the estate plan which is one of our higher plans which has all the features in it okay so that you know even when a charles is helping you out with the setup you'll have all the features available for you to go about the setup because if you are on the sprout plan it it has very limited features right so even these charles may be trying to help you set up that system some of these features may not be there for him to set that up for you so that is why we put you up on the trial period for a limited period until the end of the week when you will be on the estate plan which is during the trial period it's actually a paid plan but right now during the trial period until the end of the week it's still free so you can use this time to set the center system up for you post that based on you know whichever charles advices you on whichever plan to be on you could go ahead and make the subscription with that plan with the same account.
prospect,okay very good and what's the cost on the the estate plan as a two different plans.
rep,sure the cost on the estate plan would be its $59 for agent per month when it's billed monthly and i think it comes down to $49 per agent per month when you choose for an annual subscription.
prospect,what about the sprout plan.
rep,the sprout is a free free plan in fact so there is no no no cost to do with it then estate is in fact one of our higher plans and after sprout in fact we have something known as blossom which is i think $25 per agent per month when billed monthly and $19 per agent per month when billed on an annual subscription.
prospect,okay that's blossom.
rep,all right that's blossom what you can do in fact darren is you can type in freshdesk dot com which and i'll just quickly you know to let you know a page that you could use for your purpose of evaluation.
rep,yep and click on pricing and when you scroll down further scroll down a further bit yep you have this thing that says compare plans to see what's best for you yep right there.
rep,you just move past it scroll up a little further up i'm sorry yeah so that is having trouble picking yep right there.
prospect,okay cool.
rep,ok this is a complete understanding and this if you see are all the yearly you know for the ann- the cost that you see is for the annual subscription so you'd have the various features across these various plans which are available you can take a look at them even maybe charles will be better able to advise you because since they are currently using the system and you're looking to you know integrate with them using api i think he'll have a better idea of which is the right plan for you and accordingly you can go ahead with the subscription for that plan.
rep,alright and like i said at any point of during the setup too if you have any questions you can directly shoot out an email to the one that i send you right after the call and i'd be more than glad to assist you with the setup and with your evaluation darren.
prospect,that sounds great i sure appreciate your time in your help today all right thank you so much and it was really nice talking to you and look forward to connecting with you sometime soon.
rep,welcome to zoom enter your part if you.
rep,are in the zoom meeting now.
rep,hey this is abijith.
rep,hello abhijith we have manoj and varun and myself sukesh.
rep,oh you hi hi hi hi.
rep,i am assuming that you will be leading primarily this call right because this is more a data oriented call right with some nuggets of analytics is that correct yeah.
rep,that's how it looks like we take it as it goes and what we'll do is i'll just give a view of who we are as a company and about the practice and i also talked about you know overall data story right.
rep,in terms of both analytics and data.
rep,yes yeah based on questions or follow the you know conversation goes we will then energy optimal.
rep,i i think i think that makes sense but but the general tone of the call i think looking at his profile the deck as well should be more data right they based on the profile of the person all right we're on the same page i'll chime in eps analytic specific questions.
rep,yeah and all or if you feel you want to add a point go ahead and finish up your feature absolutely thanks.
rep,- perspective of hello.
rep,hello hello hello hi steve this is arun here don't hear how are you.
rep,i good morning arun you can hear me okay.
rep,yeah i can hear you clearly state thank you.
rep,you can sleep thanks a lot for taking the time today to chat with us we have manoj and abhijith with us.
rep,manoj is the head of big data delivery and i abhijith is the head of analytics team.
rep,they are going to lead the discussion today.
rep,hey steve how are you?.
prospect,i'm fine good morning everybody.
rep,knowing steve you know i don't give a quick brief introduction about us so the plan would be half today's we'll give you a quick overview about the organization and also a bit about our you know our practice and what we do and what capabilities we bring to the table but if there's anything that you want here specifically you know you can you can stop us any time if you have something very well here you know you can share that also right now so that we can we can kind of get to that specific point.
rep,is there specifically anything that you want hear from us today.
rep,the feed was now.
prospect,i think the capabilities is fine i mean i just want to sit back here i mean i'm settling to this new role here at univision so you know we've got people that have been doing a lot of different things over the years and i'm coming in not just to kind of review best practices but but to see where i can also help teach it's a fairly young group and some of the department so but yeah this is a long way to stay there's no specific thing i'm looking for.
prospect,i'll give you guys a chance to to talk about yourselves.
rep,sure if may steve if you can you know you can throw some light on your role you said you're just taking this role newly.
rep,i mean what would you know be your responsibilities in the new role.
prospect,the half of my time is going to be spent and this little sound i mean incredibly boring but working with our research partners like nielsen and mri gfk and making sure that what they are doing is going to be able to correct measure the hispanic population because you know it's while it's the second now the second largest ethnic group in the united states.
prospect,it's still you know it's not seen as being as upscale and it takes extra work just because of the language barrier to go out and properly recruit and maintain a sample of hispanics so that's a tap of my job.
prospect,and then some of the other things you know i'm starting to settle in and help the programming team understand help they're the ones that are really the youngest because i've analyzed and done programming television programming research for the last 20 to 25 years.
prospect,so but then you know working with people that run our viewer or community we've got a panel and you know right now my new hobby is going to be try to find an internet portal that everybody can use to share all of their work because we've got some pretty pretty big silos that have emerged and formed over the years and you know everybody has their own best solution for that but but that i mean that's today you know well i know we're but that's kind of the fun of this is it where we're making some of it up over time but.
rep,ok ok ok and perfect.
rep,you'll actually looking at somewhere where people can collaborate you know set up in a set of some work places will be put in collaborate put the documents in and share and you know what things like that is that.
prospect,yeah that's exactly right and for you know the non researchers in the company to find to provide a you know a friendly space where they can go in and find you know dashboards through something like tableau or domo ways that they can look at the high level information that they need without having to to make core areas of the research team.
rep,ok perfect.
rep,great i think it looks like a couple of things you know what we will cover today will be primarily around a few of the things that you mentioned in terms of what data capabilities that we bring to the table. what kind of technical skills we bring in you know assimilating data from all these different in your case the innovations and the other providers will give you a syndicated data.
rep,how do we bring that together into one common place and then probably build some analytics on top of it and of course the visualization part right in terms of using some using tableau or other tools to build some dashboards and stuff like that.
rep,what i'll also talk about is from and from an organization perspective what capabilities we have from a collaboration perspective.
rep,though i don't have detailed slides on it today and you know probably on our side i mean we should have had the leader of that practice also in the call - then we will definitely connect back with you on that point in terms of how we've helped some of our organization some of our customers collaborate and induce workspaces effectively.
rep,but i'll just give you some view of your things that i know offs and things that we have done you know well and some of the in appliance that we work with okay.
rep,to give you a quick yeah give you a quick overview about the organization itself with brillo we are about a three year old company so to say. we are based out at a headquartered in the silicon valley but then as you can see we've offices all over the world we had a truly global organization.
rep,pretty global for a three year old company right pretty quickly with dramshop we started building offices around and started servicing our customers and let me need for the offices all around the world is also driven by the need in a by business that we've been able to in a will and service in all these locations.
rep,so we wanted to have some newer offices to our customers and that was one of the reasons why we started setting up offices around the world.
rep,and today we have seven offices in the us.
rep,we have an office in costa rica couple of offices in europe in and we have a primary delivery centre out of bangalore india.
rep,and we have few offices in the apac region as well.
rep,so about 2500 employees in the organization and growing very fast and because over 350 clients you know spread over the world and we also along the way build roles enterprise you know great solutions right.
rep,a lot of solutions that can accelerate projects that can quickly help you realize the value of the project.
rep,and we've also built a few platforms in different areas.
rep,one of them which i will talk about specifically in the data area and in a few of those in other application rapid application development areas and testing and so on and so forth and what we've also done is we've filed in infamy showed cadence we filed a significant number of patents in the last two two and half years of which nine has been already issued across definitiveness and primarily in the you know the new areas like mobility and wearables and iot and so on and so forth and one of the things that we also decided when we started those journeys that we would start focusing our services primarily in the new areas right and in the areas that are causing disruption in the world digital destruction of the world you know anything that is digital lightweight mobility or variables or iot or you know analytics or or cloud you know where we affect a lot of a customer's adopt cloud platforms to to enhance they're in a business value to their customers that's that's who we are as an organization and if you look at what we do you basically broken our you know our view of how we want to service our customers in four different hours the first of the towers it's on the leftmost is recall the imagine tower where we have come up with our you know set of services service offerings which is a combination of frameworks templates and ready to use platforms that help our customers have imagined the art of possibility right and you know kind of help them explore ideas explore new thoughts and kind of crystallize it and come up with some quick point you know solutions that can prove to the business the value of the certain idea right so we can help them building some that you know doing some rapid prototyping building in or doing some consulting or coming up with the digital strategy and certificate in that that's what we call our imagine tower our imagine line of business the ones and typically we nail in the long term engagement we we kind of go through this journey with the customers that we we ideally want our customers to start here so that we also can appreciate and empathize with the customer on some of the ideas or some of the thoughts that they may have and once we we kind of crystallized that we helped them you know kind of build the digital experiences or you know where but it could mean anything to do with building some iot or we're in a solutions or variables or you know putting together some mobile mobile solutions and stuff like that or for that matter the last point in which i think is an imperial vintage interest for you which is around content and collaboration right so i have build those solutions and then at the back end also strengthen it with our with our engineering you know capabilities as well as our big data analytics capabilities right so that's how we operate as an organization primarily focused on enabling our customers to be digital right i mean if there are there are customers or doing business in the traditional form of a as we call it we kind of help them move to the digital world meet the new challenges the digital world and also help them you know strengthen their engineering abilities in the digital space okay that's how we are overnight any questions on that no i mean i'm looking over on the right-hand side to see i don't know if this is an example of and let's hold this to the end but of the kinds of companies that you're working with because i'm specifically i'm going to be looking at you know media type companies i see consumer technology slant media let's talk more about that when you going through the other two verticals absolutely absolutely love it about the work to be doing for this mean which may be of interest for you and the work that you've done in the india market with the one of you know with with a company called star which is part of which is in a part of networks you know empire yes yeah.
rep,so actually we've done and then we've also done work for publishing houses like sdvl you know media pretty broad term out there i mean so we've done lord in a work for media houses or in the television or you know the the visual media area as well as on the print media as well so okay.
rep,interesting stories that i can share.
prospect,there all right.
rep,and as we truly believe that are the more stories that you know where we kind cross pollinate we'll having some learnings from other industries that we feel may suddenly become relevant for the media industry as well so.
rep,i will probably catch up on some things we built this kind of interesting and may be of value to you.
rep,okay all right.
rep,quickly moving down from an data analytics perspective in others we thought was an area of interest for you you know primarily because you do analyze huge amounts of data from you know the likes of nielsen and the others.
rep,and kind of you have a plan to enhance or improve the equality of the data quality of the insights that you're getting from them.
rep,and then if i may ask you a question at this point i mean how are you dealing with the data right now you look relying on the the final insights provided by these agencies or are you purchasing raw data off and doing more of this work in-house.
rep,or is that the plan i mean.
prospect,i mean presently there there are you know we are relying on their platforms they're they're doing a lot of making a lot of changes right now by employing new technology you know they're going to be rolling in what has traditionally been their audio measurement tools a portable people meter into their television measurement there.
prospect,they're doing some modeling too you know they're going to be ingesting you know millions of set-top box viewing information over the coming year.
prospect,but we've been relying to date on their their analytical tools which are you know they're they can be powerful but they can be really clumsy but we have not seen the the need or the ability yet to do something like some of the companies like turner and fox and viacom.
prospect,we've not gone that far yet you know is that going to happen in the next year or two not clear.
prospect,i mean right now we we tend to be still more of a traditional audience by but you know we're we're looking at just through the experiences with nielsen at the quality of some of these third-party data sets and that exists in them and you know some of the misinformation that you get from it.
rep,so how reliable do you think i mean at this stage i mean are you comfortable with these secondary research i mean i also looking at any primary research and data that you want to add to it.
rep,i mean is that even is that even in the anvil or is that something that.
prospect,we need yourself great question we do occasional custom work we have a tracking study that we do twice a year.
prospect,we just move to a new vendor with that we buy secondary data through gfk or we'll be there mri american consumer study.
prospect,we have our own in-house community panel that we operate.
prospect,and so i mean that's all examples of more secondary and in some cases primary research and we haven't haven't thought about trying to record great that you know with the nielsen currency data to find more insights yet.
rep,but i mean just to let you know i mean we could we couldn't you know help you on a couple of sounds right i mean on bringing all this data together.
rep,helping you build models in in-house so that you can actually kind of control the variables build out those models at between a specific and kind of also you know over period of time rebuild the models as the audience as the understanding grows.
rep,they may not be understanding about the audience changes we can start fine tuning these a smaller than perfect i think.
rep,that's one area that we do a lot of work we've done a lot of work for the media house.
rep,in that space and that's one of our core strength areas and abhijeet on the call can talk a lot about what we've done across industries and is it has done this in the last 10 15 years right.
rep,i mean he's been doing this banks for media houses for insurance companies and so on so for so that's why i felt you know could be if they could be natural synergy where we could work on something quickly.
rep,you know in terms of actually engineering things out building out the platform that can bring those data together you know into into a common repository so to say and then have the ability to you know exposes data out to the analyst who can then build out dashboards quickly using tableau or whatever so that this data is leveraged in more ways than one right.
rep,i mean not just to build our models or to get that one fine insight and then also to look at you know maybe maybe kind of marry those data with some of the organs the in-house data that's coming out of in-house systems to get gain some insights about the business or the business performance so to say right.
rep,on a regular basis and stuff like that so these are other areas that we can work also in onset you know doing that engineering bit to set up some data platforms for you.
rep,and then let's did the area that we do a lot of work and right i mean if you look at it mean we we kind of have helped companies drive the data strategy that you know.
rep,build out the strategy first and then pull the roadmap and kind of build out these smaller blocks and because map right build the foundation and then layers on top of it and stuff like that.
rep,we will both think both the technology and the core business flash mathematic labor from a data perspective.
rep,that said this is how we we can look at our portfolio data solution.
rep,we bring you along data engineering.
rep,you know skills we bring in analysis in like divine experts and we bring in the biggest and positive to bring in that doing paper as well and the other end would be the data architect actually the scientist who bringing the the it is mathematical view to to kind of play with the data and come up with the insights as whenever it builds a lot of models.
rep,so that's how we are where we are kind of structured as a team.
rep,we do other work in marketing in science digital analytics in terms of you were talking about set up boxes in and stuff like that to like actually actually we've set up something for a service out here in the apac region which is very similar to netflix but then they they have their own set of box as well and their premium content provider. what we have set up for them is what you know the customers calls is the brain of the of their service.
rep,we actually set up the backend services to it using our own platform and we're building the recommendation right so so that the viewers who are painful premium content can actually over a period of time you know get recommendations in terms of what to view and here we build that history for them. and you actually tuned it to such an extent in the last year also that we write down getting about 96% accuracy in terms of the recommendations.
rep,that's great that's an area area that i could iq we could we could probably get working on.
rep,this right so that's that kind of gives you a few of solutions and this is how we view data i mean we don't view data in isolation right we don't view it on one end just as you know a bunch of dashboards or a bunch of insights it the business could act on.
rep,or on the other end just look at bringing the engineering part right.
rep,and so we do understand that this data that's inside the environment is outside the environment that's clean the big data that's probably dirty that's not asking with into third party windows.
rep,there are different vendors sending in data you know you've gotta mix it some structured data there's some unstructured data no there is a need to kind of put that into a single pipe harmonises and create what we call the playground right.
rep,i mean if there's a platform that we have built and we can also set up something that we spoke and you can actually build up something to you.
rep,then i think the value comes in after we are able to bring this data together right not discount any data that's out there because every data this is valuable.
rep,and you know i think with every passing day laters we be the value for data that you have is more than you know what we what we actually are right of you need to be ready it's kind of not quantifiable of this statement in companies that has been doing well across industries are the ones that have been able to appreciate the value of data that they have generated all of their windows of generated.
rep,then we can feel that this is where the world is heading and the apps on top of it would just be the reflection of you know how we are able to use the data and leverage the data and build out some good models and some solutions around it.
rep,with that said what he also kind of gives you a view of where all we can help you do that we can come up and do some advisory services.
rep,you know work with you on your own on setting up some workshops and creating that strategy roadmap or do some architecture consulting or actually build it out for you from an engineering perspective or do the analytics bit of it.
rep,or help you manage the data right i mean there's a lot of data quality issues that typically come up when you're actually sourcing data from third-party solutions and stuff like that.
rep,so that's another area where we thought we could kind of help you fill some good solutions that can manage that problem.
rep,or you know or just supporting the applications that we have right that we build out.
rep,so these are broadly areas where we can tell you know we feel that we can kind of help you on that front.
rep,from a technology landscape perspective pretty much you know mainly technology and we have skills around it.
rep,so we built a strong team that is a small time you know multi-tools killed and pretty much you need to do and we would we would be a beautiful gun it.
rep,amazing.
rep,how long any of these ring the bell well you know.
prospect,i am not an it person by trade in him and i know that the trend has been more public domain types of processing analytic tools you know.
prospect,the four that you've got on the modern sighs i can't say that i recognize any of those you know i just know that you know sass and python and those those kinds of things that have become more public domain that's where i you know if i don't even program in that but i but i know those are the tools i just add juicy tableau and and i mentioned you know we've got a colleague in a miami office that's trying to take nielsen data and and put that into domo.
prospect,i'm going to meet with her next week when i go down there see you know a others why does she you know what is she trying to do and who is she trying to get to use the data in this this more refined form.
prospect,i mean i think it's a good thing because right now all we're doing is sending out a lot of excel worksheets.
prospect,not a lot of analysis going along with it that's what i wish we can do with these kids is just crunch the data but turn them from or keepers into storytellers.
rep,so steve actually i am based out of miami.
rep,interesting like a couple of years back i met one of your colleagues from this office called carlos. so yes at that time the one of the things univision was trying to do was like how can they be higher up right in in terms of brand recall in terms of news axis and all.
rep,that that's more of the print side than the television side right.
rep,so they only understand how that can be so yeah if you're in miami next week would love to you know say hello in person and discuss all the analytics.
rep,and you are right about that observation you just made.
rep,so lot of the work we are doing is in python so alt risk tableau these are more summarization higher-level tools.
rep,right so when you go peel the onion a little more not of the world including the recommendation engine that manoj just talked about was the done for example in pi spark.
rep,right so a lot of our work these days are being done in python.
rep,it used to be more r but is moving towards python because of the simple reason that python is very easy to integrate and it's operationally efficient.
rep,yes so you can create literally anything as the api is then it is you know then dot it's agnostic really right of where you are putting these models.
rep,so you know we are deploying these models that we develop on historical data we have deployed it in aws ml azure ml sparc ml all python based models which are then you know basically integrated as api's.
rep,that gives a better sense okay you know.
prospect,i think the big biggest challenge for us you know i'm working on the television side i've got a colleague that does digital you know we own radio stations as well we are we are really a prisoner to nielsen because they are the currency.
prospect,i'm you know in audio or radio and television.
prospect,not so much in digital though they have an internet measurement service.
prospect,and that's part of it but it's taking those different samples and then trying to fuse them together using whatever.
prospect,i mean fusion techniques you you buy into and and try to make them all look at one a single source sample and yeah that's the holy grail for us and media.
prospect,because we go off here we advertise you know in the case of your univision we have radio stations we might be promoting a show that's on tonight at 8 o'clock on the radio station and you'd really love to be able to see well how effective is that medium and driving.
rep,yeah position so we i we have done yeah yeah we have done very similar work for sony in miami right. which is exactly the same problem their thing was remember running a chanel spot right and chanel offending that money can i tell them that this ad that you are running is actually mattering in your viewership in your sales right.
rep,so that says the they were they're trying to see how can we justify or at the tie that the promotional sport they're investing in is actually adding a similar problem you're trying to solve.
prospect,yeah we're all looking for that holy grail to show the return on investment.
rep,i'm good on it yes so yeah so it's.
rep,obviously some of the purchases for these items happen offline so the pilot that we did there was like some of merchants they were willing to share you know our install and digital sales data.
rep,because that you will not know right so what we did with sony was like bring the media side data and there's an attribution of sales the sale of data we did a pilot with some of the profession companies there with the pilot was in that case fashion industry.
rep,they share their sales data so we could do the causality and attribution and media mix analysis configure that.
prospect,guys we're coming up on 10:30 and i want to make sure we're able to get through all the information you know.
prospect,if any of you i don't know who how many are in miami you don i'm getting in late on monday night i'll be there tuesday night if somebody wanted to come by tuesday i've got meetings during the day.
prospect,but you know think of that as another chance to get together but yeah okay yeah once you find where in the deck is going to be the best example that to talk about you know things as we've already been leading up to this point.
prospect,you know what our what our needs are and.
rep,sure so sure yeah this one we leave you a couple of thoughts like maybe i'll take in a minute.
rep,so what we've done if you like up with open source feeds right.
rep,so what we've also done is we've taken that the batch of lead open source platforms that are products that are available on the big data side.
rep,we've actually created a platform which we call the brillio data platform right so.
rep,underneath that is all open source tools and we've kind of taken the best of breed for each of those in a need and we put it on layer it on top with our own ip terms of managing and orchestrating all these tools.
rep,and what being able to solve when those in one able to help our customers quickly get to solving the business problems or business use cases that isn't worrying too much about the technology.
rep,but second when we actually get this back from behind it also you know we've made sure that we don't you know have too much of programming knowledge needed to run this platforms have you actually made it a lot of you know we've built analog gui based you know.
rep,if we made it both gui based so that you don't have to draw scale or build up a new skill within the organization or reach skill some of it you know it's listingbook and you know worry about getting to use the latest and greatest in technology right so.
rep,those are things that we've been able to address with this and what we've also done is we've decided that we let me put this platform where everybody can collaborate easily with the creator engineers or the data scientists or the analyst right.
rep,you can collaborate on one single platform and deliver maximum value out of this platform.
rep,so this is something that i probably was or as a note even the plug dozen customers including that media customer that i was talking about.
rep,so this is what is running at the back end and we've built our analytic models on top of it to provide the recommendations.
rep,this is something that that is our own ip and we'd be more than happy to do a quick demo at some point when available.
rep,from a case study perspective we spoke about some of these to lose something that we did for you know an india-based pages is a powerful toast for you.
rep,this is a you know a television channel that caters to that has a bunch of channels that probably has 60% of viewership in india.
rep,and what they wanted to do was they want to actually go after the younger generation.
rep,i mean business the set of channels like 20 25 years old and they felt that their viewership population with aging and they want to get to the newer generation which is going on after different shows and they had a slightly different approach to watching linear television and stuff like that.
rep,so they would actually see what kind of changes they have to make to linear television as and also to app-based content right.
rep,so they actually want to understand how you know the youth so this is because of social media profiling of the field and kind of figure out what kind of content would fit into different you know youth that came out different lifestyles gender.
rep,you know difference other demographic values and stuff like that.
rep,so we combined the huge amount of data from twitter and facebook and so on and so forth and built reconnaissance a notice that you put posted to the north platform for for them to get a quick view of the inside stuff like that.
rep,again be it the recommendation engine that i was talking about this is for the video on-demand service company running on our platform light as we speak now.
rep,and serving content it's actually integrated with their content server so based on the recommendation because we could pick and choose the content from the recommend somebody content server.
rep,and now as the customer views it and based on where and when he pauses and stuff like that all these are analyzed.
rep,and then based on that we come up with some recommendations and if you see that customers are pausing movies midway they're able to only watch for an hour and they then don't watch it again.
rep,so we can mind that they didn't come back with you know the shorter capsule one our content into genre that the customer may be interested in is and so on suppose write.
rep,smaller things that kind of help us in the customer retains their consumer base and stuff like that.
rep,so the spheres up in the middle do something little bit for disney so to say.
rep,i mean we again this is all around the star wars movies.
rep,so this was a big break in powers movies until 2015 and before they launched it this like mega program that they embarked on which included large in a work across about eight platforms.
rep,i hate social media platforms that they they were in a kind of advertising a putting in some content teasers and so on and so forth.
rep,and also there's a lot of activity that was happening on their stores.
rep,their own website and there was the the fan convention and stuff like that.
rep,so we actually gathered information from all these different you know platforms plus the fan you know convention and stores and stuff exactly.
rep,mash then together we also mix the sales data in especially from the stores for the collectibles you know.
rep,services from star wars and we kind of figure out where the buzzwords in what what channel they had invest more and where they had to create more buzz.
rep,where was the you know different demographic segments which which platform were they in and where they had to go in and kind of put in more effort to bring more people on board and stuff like that.
rep,so this is another thing that we did i thought this may be of interest for you again something that we did produce me again.
rep,this is more on especially specifically going after their videos in games.
rep,we were trying to get the buzz around their videos and put the back end on in a build the back end solution for it.
rep,and we also helped them migrate the entire solution onto the cloud right.
rep,so lot of engineering effort involved on this.
rep,this is the voice customer engine again.
rep,this is something for another media major in the asian market.
rep,so do lot surveys we actually did help them design for their in a primary research as well.
rep,collected all the data build the models and provided insight.
rep,so so few i'm just throwing in you know few of the stories around.
rep,okay well maybe need collaboration spark.
rep,can you go back.
rep,and a lot of work on the sharepoint side as well.
rep,what we do is when we pick you next time in miami.
rep,we'll probably talk a bit more about these in an analytics stories and maybe also talk a little bit about what we've done in the collaboration space because that's another area that you mentioned is a native interest.
prospect,yeah the the meeting that i had yesterday with a supplier was it's not to take huge data sets raw data sets and try to make sense of them.
prospect,it's really just organizing all of the stuff that's already been done.
prospect,and so i don't want to wanted to mislead you to think that that's something we're currently diving into.
prospect,this we were just trying to help our internal clients figure out where the stuff is that they need.
prospect,so maybe that helps clarify via that particular project back on page 18 can you go back just one please.
rep,sure .
prospect,at the very top of that it the second bullet it says complement hoops yeah the insights will complement surveys and trp is used for decision.
prospect,so you guys don't have the tools for that or do you.
prospect,for doing the surveys or like we have a community ourselves and we've got a vendor that that has a you know software that allows us to create survey.
rep,yeah yeah you're right we don't have that but then we can help you design those surveys.
rep,we can help you build out the life there is any more from a from a design perspective service.
rep,every design and stuff like that so not necessarily having that survey engine so to say.
prospect,that's fine that it's you know you i'd be afraid of you somebody comes in and says we can do everything.
prospect,and i wouldn't you pray that just be a little leery but but yeah that's why there is that specialize in that okay.
rep,well i mean yeah i guess.
rep,one point uh steve while you were mentioning about that you know ability to get to the data set.
rep,i decided to fill you know when i heard it this time i thought it's likely to be like okay what are you looking at if you have the data stored somewhere but then you will actually go back and have the ability to quickly reach out to the data right.
rep,so when i first started i thought you would like trying to build out a collaboration you know like a sharepoint site and stuff is it but i think what you're also looking or as is the ability to go after you know search for that particular data set.
rep,you know easily and then try and get to the inside quicker right.
rep,this is like you different in the sense that and i quote an example of what we are doing for a pharma company right now right.
rep,so they do they get again it is similar right they get a lot of syndicated data for when they do drug testing and you know when they also some of these clinical trials and stuff like that.
rep,so there are a lot of data that's either in a primary readers as they get some their own field agents or secondary data from some people in a probably contractor them.
rep,or something data from between market you know agencies.
rep,now what what happens is all of this has to be put together and then he left analyze it now one of the biggest challenges that they had is to go handle those matching datasets.
rep,the ability to make sure that they they are able to get those data out to the analyst quickly.
rep,now that is one of the challenges we addressed right by putting it out into a big native platform and stuff like that and you know able to process the data quickly.
rep,want to what we also what we discovered back we were doing that then we helped solve this the ability to to actually go in and be able to provision a certain data quickly right.
rep,the ability presented search and what they're looking for and to be able to provision that take it out so basically like up in the retail store review you won't have that ability to go around to the right aisle pick the data of the shelf walk out check out with your data and then you're off the store and then you do your analysis with the data the way you want to do and then come up with the other side.
rep,so so basically what what people are struggling with is finding up where the data was lying.
rep,i mean the cataloging was the data catalog is missing right and the ability to quickly search out of the data catalog and kind of have that kind of a store front feeling right.
rep,um you you basically are going into a store and you know where to go you know whether where the milk is you know it's in the diary section we just go there.
rep,the milk walk out right if you want you don't necessarily have to then you know find out where milk is stored and that's just the kind of experience that we have created for this customer.
rep,and if i if i understood that last bit that you were just mentioning and got something that you're trying to solve.
rep,yeah now where is my right.
prospect,there's a lot of syndicated data that word that we're getting access to your your right i mean so there's gfk is tomorrow night survey.
prospect,there's the nielsen data they all have their own proprietary desktop applications to analyze their own data.
prospect,in the case of those two in particular however they have been able to get together and figured out how the fuse those two databases.
prospect,they're not common.
prospect,it's not a single source database but there's they've created statistical hooks where they try to make it look like it is one.
prospect,so that's one where it exists now we haven't we're just getting access to that ourselves starting this fall.
prospect,and so how clunky that's going to be is going to be interesting.
prospect,but then how you know what's the cost and what's the added benefit that's where we're all moving though it's trying to take as an industry is to take all of these third-party databases experian axiom nustar and try to fuse them all together and try to help us understand you know you know.
prospect,for a tv standpoint i don't care that they also buy you know certain kinds of being.
prospect,things are they the driver particular maybe i care about particular cars ad sales does but if i'm a programmer.
prospect,you know i want to know more attitudinal type things i want to see what else they're watching.
prospect,i want to know where else on television but i also want to know what radio they listen to.
prospect,what where they go online and and what they do entertainment wise.
prospect,so that i can can place my money off air in some of those same places and.
prospect,also maybe i could find some new opportunities content that we aren't doing that would blend in beautifully.
prospect,you know they may not think that univision should be you know in that space but if i see that that's something they enjoy doing then let's look at that as a new opportunity for us.
rep,oh absolutely i think i think i think i think we're talking to same thing and i think there's a lot that we can we can definitely this isn't details right.
rep,because the way i see it is i think you're looking at a couple of things right.
rep,you're trying to build that you know what we in the technology you know folks call a data lake right.
rep,you trying to bring all the data that is lying out there into one single repository and then and not worry too much about modeling it out or you know kind of constricting it.
rep,then leave it out there for people to come and play around with with that data and discover insights right rather than channel it and suggest a certain set of kpis.
rep,typically that that used to be then you define the kpis and you.
rep,measure the lead against those kpis zeroes rather than what is happening right now where you let the data out there you make sure that you're enabling people here with the access to every data that's possibly out there.
rep,and you let them somewhere inside new find newer correlations and you know uncover new business opportunities.
rep,i think that's one one aspect to it that you're looking for and the other is probably having that ability to go and specifically pull out you know a certain data set a certain report that came in from nielsen or some other syndicated data.
rep,and then pull it out into their personal space and kind of do the analysis and pull that view on the data.
rep,two different things that yeah but one you know looking at that platform that can that can kind of solve both these problems.
rep,yeah anything we'll be able to elaborate more with some plan or road ideas that we can share and if i go get in disgust mode.
rep,okay there's somebody else do you think you should be you should be part of this also steve maybe you can catch time it that way maybe you can have you know maybe somebody from be the it technology team who you feel should also be part of the description.
rep,so that you guys can present the ideas to him or her as well.
prospect,i'm sure there is and you know mine one of my colleagues and i'm just learning some of my new colleagues just because i've been here so little so recent is our head of ad sales research.
prospect,and i know she's going to have a better understanding of you know what their needs would be and who's supporting them from an it perspective.
prospect,she just went away on holiday as of today so i mean she'll be back next week but that's something that i could talk about with her.
prospect,you know just this idea of this portal from the data portal and you know the the report portal is something that she's going to be i mean integral in figuring me out.
prospect,and you know what do they need how often they will they even use it that's that's another big concern guys.
prospect,i'm sure that you have to deal with you can build a tremendous tool but if you've got people that are so swamped on a day-to-day basis you're not going to get the casual user to dive in.
prospect,and everybody's got day jobs already so that's the challenge is trying to to free up more time to use and do more things.
prospect,you know just like i said the goal with the young miami team is to convert them from being you know scorekeepers into storytellers.
prospect,you know that that means they've got to do their job differently.
prospect,they've got to stop doing certain things because we're not growing in terms of head town as a company.
prospect,so in some sure that's the case with many of you or most of your clients is what what can i do less of in order to do some of this new cool stuff that can be that can be incremental.
prospect,and then coming up with new ideas a new product.
rep,okay i think what we will do is while we plan out a date where we can need you.
rep,we'll also in the background work on maybe a short decorator maybe maybe five six slights on a point of view on some of these areas.
rep,where we kind of egg that discussion kind of focused on these two three points right.
rep,on building the you know the ability to build that data lake right where we do people can discover insights.
rep,also a portal where people can go quickly access the data that they need.
rep,and then maybe another portal where you can actually end access the insights as in like the dashboards and stuff like that.
rep,so maybe through clear areas and then also maybe some some view on what potential analytics we could do.
rep,and if you if you have something in mind in terms of your current challenges maybe we can tailor some of our thoughts on on the specific analytics points also.
rep,and then maybe have a workshop kind of a you know a meeting where we kind of focus on these four for four or five points right so that we kind of then can narrow down focus on areas that we can work in and have crystallized the next step side and if for next you know.
prospect,i i dunno i mean next week i'm pretty booked in the miami trip but i'm going back down on what's this the 10th and the 11th whatever the thursday/friday is in august.
prospect,which is a beautiful be in miami by the way.
rep,when it was not a good time to be in miami.
prospect,i'm not sure but the 11 you know maybe earlier in the day my digital colleague that i had referred to he's based down there and i'd like for him to kind of see this he's got he's been with the company for 11 or 12 years.
prospect,so he's going to know more of what's been going on on this side but you know maybe we can do that on the morning at the 11th.
prospect,what do you think.
rep,whoo when you look down and you let's do it that okay yeah.
rep,we did you could do but i know those right i mean of course of course yeah that's it really a good idea to have the your dear colleague from digital as well because then we can know what kind of work in terms of attribution in terms of media mix plus what digital assets do you have in terms of deeper like.
rep,so yeah that will be greater yeah yeah i am local here if your trip will definitely pencil it down and i will check with you prior to that and also in in the interim if there are specific things as you yourself said right you are still getting to know the organization maybe.
rep,what we can do is before the 11th right we can definitely circle back with you to see if there are other things that would be of interest. so that if we meet for a couple of hours hour and a half of it work then we can you know ensure that we are making best use of your time now.
rep,yes b sounds good.
prospect,all right well folks thank you very much this is a good introduction i see some really some cool media related things that you know i need to figure out it you know.
prospect,we're we're up to that right now hopefully we will be but as you know we didn't have the kind of competition i honestly in the spanish-language marketplace right now that some of our english language colleagues that burner and by and a box entering country.
prospect,where they're having to try to move beyond nielsen to come up with ways to depict their audience with tracked advertisers right.
prospect,all right well gentlemen i hope you have a good weekend and i'll continue to stay in touch through email.
prospect,thank you all right.
rep,thank you goodbye.
rep,goodbye.
prospect,one of them which i will talk about specifically in the data area and in a few of those in other application rapid application development areas and testing and so on and so forth and what we've also done is we've filed in infamy showed cadence we filed a significant number of patents in the last two two and half years of which nine has been already issued across definitiveness and primarily in the you know the new areas like mobility and wearables and iot and so on and so forth and one of the things that we also decided when we started those journeys that we would start focusing our services primarily in the new areas right and in the areas that are causing disruption in the world digital destruction of the world you know anything that is digital lightweight mobility or variables or iot or you know analytics or or cloud you know where we affect a lot of a customer's adopt cloud platforms to to enhance they're in a business value to their customers that's that's who we are as an organization and if you look at what we do you basically broken our you know our view of how we want to service our customers in four different hours the first of the towers it's on the leftmost is recall the imagine tower where we have come up with our you know set of services service offerings which is a combination of frameworks templates and ready to use platforms that help our customers have imagined the art of possibility right and you know kind of help them explore ideas explore new thoughts and kind of crystallize it and come up with some quick point you know solutions that can prove to the business the value of the certain idea right so we can help them building some that you know doing some rapid prototyping building in or doing some consulting or coming up with the digital strategy and certificate in that that's what we call our imagine tower our imagine line of business the ones and typically we nail in the long term engagement we we kind of go through this journey with the customers that we we ideally want our customers to start here so that we also can appreciate and empathize with the customer on some of the ideas or some of the thoughts that they may have and once we we kind of crystallized that we helped them you know kind of build the digital experiences or you know where but it could mean anything to do with building some iot or we're in a solutions or variables or you know putting together some mobile mobile solutions and stuff like that or for that matter the last point in which i think is an imperial vintage interest for you which is around content and collaboration right so i have build those solutions and then at the back end also strengthen it with our with our engineering you know capabilities as well as our big data analytics capabilities right so that's how we operate as an organization primarily focused on enabling our customers to be digital right i mean if there are there are customers or doing business in the traditional form of a as we call it we kind of help them move to the digital world meet the new challenges the digital world and also help them you know strengthen their engineering abilities in the digital space okay that's how we are overnight any questions on that no i mean i'm looking over on the right-hand side to see i don't know if this is an example of and let's hold this to the end but of the kinds of companies that you're working with because i'm specifically i'm going to be looking at you know media type companies i see consumer technology slant media let's talk more about that when you going through the other two verticals absolutely absolutely love it about the work to be doing for this mean which may be of interest for you and the work that you've done in the india market with the one of you know with with a company called star which is part of which is in a part of networks you know empire yes yeah.
prospect,and then if i may ask you a question at this point i mean how are you dealing with the data right now you look relying on the the final insights provided by these agencies or are you purchasing raw data off and doing more of this work in-house.
rep,but you know think of that as another chance to get together but yeah okay yeah once you find where in the deck is going to be the best example that to talk about you know things as we've already been leading up to this point.
prospect,okay there's somebody else do you think you should be you should be part of this also steve maybe you can catch time it that way maybe you can have you know maybe somebody from be the it technology team who you feel should also be part of the description.
rep,hello hello hello hello.
rep,allison are you able to hear me? allison chris.
rep,hello oh hey guys i think you've join but i'm fortunately not able to pick up an audio from your end.
prospect,good morning it's allison.
rep,hello allision this is jay how you doing.
rep,hi good thank you.
rep,so i'm the only one here right now i'm not sure where my colleagues are but yeah i'm waiting for.
prospect,so we have i don't know if we explained this earlier but we we have a cot we've hired a company that actually does our you know level-1 level-2 support work for us and they're the ones that will actually be making the calls and using this system so i so a couple of them should be joining they said they could come over and i should be joining today to make sure that it you know it will work on their end as well.
prospect,if you don't mind just waiting a few moments let me see if i can be there here.
rep,so allison so while we wait for them just give a quick heads-up or you know an idea of you know how exactly you're these teams are how are they going to be using freshdesk and what is the current process?.
prospect,so right now we we had a developer and house create that the system the tool that we're using right now and essentially we are just wanting freshdesk to replace that.
prospect,so what they're doing we describe as we described yesterday is we essentially have two groups at simple we have the transcribers and then we have the outbound callers.
prospect,we never take answer life calls so what we do is any any voicemail that comes to valve either through our main number through our billing number will go into say a bucket or a queue and the transcribers will grab those they then they filter those voicemails and they determine where they go.
prospect,so basically it's whether they deserve a call or not so if they if they you know determine that they need a call back then they send it to another bucket or queue where then the outbound callers i guess agents or whoever when i call them.
rep,okay also also also ellison so so there's no channel of inbound calls coming into your system so any call that comes in would be sent to voicemail straight that right? yes always yes.
rep,okay okay okay so in freshdesk how we can do this is uh so we could probably minimize the number of rings on each one system so as soon as the first screen comes in so after the first ring you know we can make sure it directly goes to the voicemail.
rep,so that's how we'd be able to do it because you know freshdesk has a phone system that allows incoming calls as well so what we could do is we could reduce the incoming ring time and directly you know make sure all the calls go to voicemail.
rep,and yeah well explain the rest of the phone channel as we are getting into the demo but also just for my understanding so who are these callers so uh what are types of calls that you receive? 
prospect,so with so probably 90 to 95 percent of our calls are probably our customers or users that use our steam steam games which i can't remember yesterday i don't think you're familiar with that platform correct.
rep,yeah i used to play counter-strike so as a matter.
prospect,okay okay.
prospect,so so probably 90- to 95% of the voicemails are left by our steam customers the other 5% are are people who are actually trying to get to either you know one of the valve employees or to our valve hr department so that's that's kind of the break down.
prospect,the calls that we we only want the calls we only want to come in are regarding billing or say you know if there's fraud fraudulent charges or if they don't recognize the charges otherwise otherwise our steam users use a ticketing system email that's our main support.
rep,so we are trying to also bring in that email address with users use a ticketing system email that's our main support so we are trying to also bring in that email address with freshdesk?.
prospect,oh no not for the ticketing system yeah yeah the only the only email address i think are you talking about what we were talking about yesterday.
prospect,i really wasn't on the call yesterday so with my colleague jeku kind of explained to me the entire phone situation with the support not really.
rep,so so i'm the one who i'm the solution consultant in here so i'm that's what i'm trying to get as you know clear understanding of you know how you're trying to set up the system because freshdesk is a complete helpdesk system which manage not only just your you know your phone channels but also your entire email support ect.
prospect,oh i apologize i thought you were on the call yesterday so i bought it so let me let me give you a little more detail then.
prospect,so the five percent of the calls that come in that aren't steam related we would be an option to to just forward the link or send an email to say the hr department and that's outside of freshdesk.
prospect,are you i think hey so the folks from our contracting company blueprint are here jessica and caesar and caesars going to talk to you he can probably speak the language a little better than i can.
rep,oh perfect hey hey oh hey caesar.
prospect,oh quick question right now your voicemail box is controlled.
prospect,valve or chris.
prospect,and is that an internal system you guys set up that deposits it or is he using a company.
prospect,you're just using our like report on that we had polycom.
prospect,because it might be honestly easier for it to maintain that way i know you want the outbound but the inbound the main reason wasn't saying it he is suggesting a good idea which is a mobile second ring time that automatically goes into it but then you have to rebuild a repository and stuff like that.
prospect,right yeah i was going to bring that up yes i think i know a lot to think that i don't think you guys want to mess with your repository works perfectly for what you want.
prospect,right .
rep,uh okay so yep i mean ceaser yeah i think only with the understanding as well so yeah so freshdesk is a multi-channel.
prospect,i was actually the one who brought freshdesk up to them i use them for our department in our site operations department.
prospect,so just to get more into the semantics aspect of this pretty much what they require is i know you guys have the app for the api key for ringcentral can they use ring central for outbound calls and will that automatically populate a ticket or are they gonna have to breathe are they gonna have to create a ticket every time the user ringcentral.
rep,know how the ring central freshdesk integration will work is so we already built that integration also native integration so what we would enable is so we would  so and it's again so what would happen is integrating it automatically create tickets as soon as you receive a call and you're in central desktop client.
prospect,okay so now phone calls will still have to be manual?.
prospect,okay yeah they should in all honestly.
prospect,yeah okay and for that the main thing they're going to require is two separate sections for example like i stated before we have it and then we have our site operations group so they're going to require a two groups one of them being the trans hosers want to be them being the people who call back so they would require some group to the initial ticket should always be assigned to the transposers because they had to read afer's make sure everything's good and then assign it and then in all honesty in their contacts list they would just require a contact for like hr and billing and such so what they could do is when they send a ticket and resolve it they can resolve for like subject type of hr and hr automatically receives an email notification being like hey there was a ticket that was just closed underneath but it's been redistributed to you with the url which we can see if there's a way that you guys can integrate it from their system to auto pull if not copying and pasting the url will take a second just so they can receive an equal notification.
rep,i know so the email notifications can be automatically triggered from within freshdesk.
rep,and also you have additional steps as well so when you're creating the group itself so let's say if our ticket is unanswered set for a period of time we will be able to auto escalate to another person etc so that's probably the secondary.
rep,but yes alright so let's say or so the the transcribers received the voicemail so that would so every time a call comes in that will you know generate a ticket so once you know the transcriber go through the entire voicemail so they can listen to the entire voicemail right from within the ticket right so they can open a ticket and once they receive the ticket they say you know okay you know what this needs to go to my outbound team or to my callers they can just put it to that group you know let's say you have a group created say outbound callers so once you put it to that group we can notify all the agents oh you know or we can even send them an email to that group say you know hey a ticket is coming or if you outbound always mining that queue they can always just pick up these tickets and call.
rep,well now let's say it's a different issue apart from you know it's not that they're billing related issue it's team then you can always put it to your hr team or the other groups that you've created and as soon as you know that team receives you know the ticket we can you know notify them by email and we also do a bunch of automation apart from that it's or like you know automatically updating the ticket type but if it's cool that it's put hr we can you know probably put the you know issue type is you know returned and refund or shipping payments etc so we can.
prospect,so with our example we'll use hr group is there a way to transpose a rule that says let's say i assign ticket to the hr group when it goes into the hr group it literally just resolves itself so they don't have to log in the main thing is there should only be two people who actually touch the system which are going to be people listening to the calls and people making a call outbound call.
prospect,hr building stuff like that all that requires an email notification so there's a way to set it that when you assign it to group hr group billing it'll automatically resolve ticket send the distribution that we can create an email being like hey you know.
rep,so what we do what we could do is let's say if you know let's say if a ticket has been put or if it's been assigned to a group let's say uh you know let's say i have you know marketing as a group right for example it's think that that's hr for us.
rep,so everytime if a ticket has been put to the marketing on the hr group we can automatically set actions like you know you know set the status of that particular ticket to resolve and also you know send email notifications accordingly to the group itself so you can send it to to group it to the assigned group with a subject saying you know hey this is ticket was being raised is the ticket and we can also insert placeholders where we can also insert the ticket you urls itself.
rep,so in case a hr needs to get back into the system to look at the ticket we can enable.
prospect,so the voicemail file will need to be attached because hr will never have access to freshdesks.
prospect,so it's not so they can assign the url just like you guys.
prospect,oh probably as long as they can just automatically assign the url then we're good.
prospect,yeah okay.
prospect,so that what we just what use went through it is that'll probably about the 5% of those voicemails just so you know that's about the 5%.
prospect,and we have probably four different emails i think right now four different emails that we would need to have set up that they that the transcribers could could forward to so but it sounds like that's doable.
prospect,yeah that's very easy.
rep,okay yeah that's pretty simple so within any ticket to you so when you open up any ticket within freshdesk you will have the option do you know so there's a bunch of things so part of this is replying to that will be able to also forward this ticket to you know another email address or a particular email address and also we'd be able to add notes to a ticket as well great so let's say just within your transcribers itself or they identify you know this is what they have confusion identifying a particular issue so they can just you know interact among themselves you know within agents right that happens i'm sure a lot saying what hey guys i don't know what this is about.
prospect,you know let me show them really quick yeah let me show them really quickly on my end i would look like for an agent since i have my freshdesk open.
rep,i've actually been sharing my screen i you guys not looking at my screen?.
prospect,yeah we can see it i just wanted to show her more yeah i see it yeah a little harder he's just going to show me something.
prospect,like that but we have requestor this is where little saladin since everybody's going to be prayed in the tickets and it'll be free i'll do j jones for now but you have hr yeah you show their issue let's say for my stuff new hire hardware/software subject voice all received the status resolved group i decided to myself bud and they will just paste their yeah whatever it is it's literally just submit the close yeah okay.
prospect,and we can simplify it i realize i call those different and that's mine is more specifically broken down because since we do the it and all that we have a lot more issues like he showed you before it like all this is very easy said an issue code is easy you guys would need billing hr account fraud like those and those can all be just a secondary group of no actual drop-down mine just has a lot more for our sla purposes and then what happens is she receives a message and if i had tied a url it just says url here but otherwise it says i sent it to jay jones in the message content this is also good because it tells you who did it.
prospect,but how how's it going to look in our email? i guess what i'm wondering she can actually pull it oh it looks just like a standard email reply.
prospect,and it'll and it's obvious you go click on the url in yep and that's why the easiest way the way and we do it is we actually have a lot of canned responses i created these from scratch they're super simple he was showing you them earlier but you can have one that says like hr one that says yeah stuff like that and it's just okay this we received a voicemail for the hr department click the link below and then all you have to have them do is paste perfect okay they paste a link and when they result in ticket your hr department will get a notification that tickets been resolved from us well from you guys with a link in it so when they read the description says hey you know we received an hr related ticket call click here to open the link i click it and it opens just like you have it.
prospect,okay okay so that sounds like hovers i'm that sounds good that covers that 5%.
prospect,so let's talk about what it looks like when they send it i guess to to our other our outbound caller group which they would be accessing freshdesk as well.
prospect,so there's two ways they'll see it through the dashboard which says like andrew campbell has submitted a new one but for example if somebody assigns it to me it'll tell me like somebody has assigned it to you.
rep,yeah the best part is you can just create a group so under tickets so we can using the filtering options so let's say when i when i type in sales i'd be able to see all the tickets that have been assigned sales group and i can create this as a view and i can you know name this as you know sales tickets for its own right so that's how it works.
rep,so i'll show you how i work probably  that will give you a clear understanding.
rep,so i belong to the pre-sales team so this is my this is all the tickets that my team receives right so all these are new tickets as you can see is all new tickets and it's not been assigned to any agent so when i pick up this ticket and i start working on this this ticket automatically be assigned my name as an agent and so this could be your outbound callers view where they see all the tickets right and when they interact with the customer and the customer respond to them you know back and forth conversation so i've also create another view just for myself saying you know jay's is open and pending tickets so when i click on that i'll be able to see all the open and pending tickets i have open a my name.
rep,so these are conversations that i'm already having with my customers over customer response it would just be threaded in the same ticket so i can you know probably you know when i come into work i mainly focus attention on this group because these are you know customers that are directly dependent on me.
rep,so i would respond in these as you can see i have no open tickets right.
rep,now so i've cleared all of them and then i would you know when i'm free and you know when i've cleared my open tickets i get back to my pre-sales ticket queue and then now i start answering that tickets to my team.
rep,and i was like very solid case book.
prospect,if you have a way of organizing a set are in your own queue and you have a way of organizing those ones say if you want to call someone back you know if you you didn't get through to them or there wasn't voice initely want to call them later yes well.
rep,absolutely so yeah so what i what i do personally is so within an ticket so we have something called as to do this that's an i reaiiy so i just go to the to-do list and i add my to do i can say call you know customer back and you know p.m tomorrow
rep,i'm going to add this as a to-do list this would also show up on my dashboard right so when i'm on my dashboard so we will show me my to-do list so as soon as the open freshdesk i'd be like okay you know what hey today i have to call this customer at 11 p.m which was found no with respect to this ticket so i would go ahead and you know complete this task for so once i do that it would pick up yeah perfect okay and.
prospect,then i'm assuming it's easy to just give a ticket to another agent if you can't do it i'm assuming that's okay.
prospect,oh yeah that's all drop-down pre-populated information this is what you.
rep,we have ticket properties where i can look at i want to reassign this from chandler to let's say roberts i can just go ahead and change the agents name in the group's name example and update the ticket that's all it'll be assigned to that.
prospect,me an advantage is i do an all nighter transpose a user versus a different team if they move it as a transpose or q nobody else can see it.
rep,for the people whose group subtraction side so that you can create your own admin groups to see everybody's ticket.
rep,gotcha yeah yeah mix.
prospect,okay and then um storage as far as yesterday i think we had a few questions around the storage of information and the urls and retention yeah and the retention you do how does that work on your end or how long what's your capacity of storage.
rep,oh okay so i mean so these are there's absolutely no limit for storage right so we completely hosted on aws so things on the cloud and there's no storage as such for any account so you can have as many data as much data as you want within the freshdesk system.
rep,which is really.
rep,we we have customers you know for example you know tesla so tesla is a company and show you how you'll see on my system so they have another company called solar city so they have i think six to seven accounts with us and they have i think close to 250 to 300 thousand tickets in each you know per account.
prospect,it is you do enable so that is something i'll let you know default this does not come with ssl yet to go and put it into your host and everything like that yeah but once it's printed you guys are the only ones who have access to it 50 what they're also those certificates didn't think yeah there's a really simple one thing little sensitive yeah and then uh but yeah when it comes on to the encryption besides them nobody else has a see.
prospect,anyway definitely issue okay in itself does that says no scape that angle can take care of it for you but there's no yeah there he goes.
prospect,no honestly being able to use your own centralized certificate like you guys can do prevents anybody from accessing it especially with your network setup here.
rep,channel and the retentions on their server and so i mean even if you need any updates right so you can just go to update start freshdesk you see anything that's happening on our side then it's completely open to all our customers so all our system operations anything if it's down you'd find all of these data right here so you can see also the past incidents and if anything was down as you can see nothing's been reported even if there was we would automatically updated on our site here so and you can see the resolution time which you know within a couple of minutes sometimes even seconds say go ahead and resolve it so yep.
prospect,missed part of the actual voicemails were they how they handle missed that part time.
rep,so uh you miss ours how they're stored or why when i suggested to keep them the system you guys already have so there's no distribution to another one especially since its already working with a new url and everybody within the net can already access them i think that retention model you guys have that could just be a link to the foul it's honestly the best because the way they can do it with the ring central.
rep,central's callbacks.
prospect,well so i don't want your because we haven't actually really discussed that.
prospect,with them yet so what do you are currently taking calls on our pbx in the house and we don't want to continue to do that for this.
prospect,we want to call come in and the voicemail ecology system is not.
prospect,okay maybe you guys do just want to get rid of your pbx system and respect you yeah these customer call voicemails.
prospect,okay so right now i'm going to give you some clarification right now our voicemails when they come in we have it set up that they automatically go into i guess it goes to an email address right which goes into our a tool that we want to get rid of so we were - what would that look like with your system so if someone calls our main number and they you know push option seven or whatever they end up leaving a voicemail then how what is that how do we get that voicemail to you?.
rep,by that so there's no an automatically a ticket will be created with the worse now with the number four where we was calling you don't have recent tickets to see if this customers call back and you know in the past and it would have a play message right here so when you click on that you'd be able to directly listen to the voicemail.
rep,but i color have a below turn.
prospect,on the transcript yeah yeah but america.
prospect,oh the inbound call has to come in to something and leave a voice know right yeah there so yep three central or whoever sit integration you have but it yeah there so yep three central or whoever sit integration you have but it can also take the inbound call yep right.
prospect,this one can do it.
prospect,so oh is that a fresh desk number then so how does it so we have numbers right now right so how does that work do i guess so how how that work is so once you completely moving to freshdesk you'll be able to port the existing number into the freshness system so once it's configured here you know we could go ahead and you know set up systems like you know you could also set up an ivr are saying you know press one for sales or you know press one for if you're a steam user press two if you're not press three for billing rated issues etc and we can also route these you know with key presses to directly to a group or to you know a number and you can also have general settings like you know we'll be able to also record calls all the calls that are happening within the freshdesk system both inbound and so you know you could set up your voicemail - this way go set up your voicemail around going on delivery messages and on the dashboard itself so we have a phone history so when you go to call history you can see our you know all the calls that have been made from your outbound agents and if you know you have the call recording feature on you can also listen to those calls directly as well.
rep,so currently we have a account with ringcentral another is an integration piece that goes with that is that correct.
rep,use them as a the calling function yeah we may want it you know so.
rep,this is being integrated with ring central so it's covered in all the plans so and so this is what the ring central integration will do.
rep,so it will automatically create a ticket you have tasks as soon as you receive a call or rings central phone so ticket will be created and all the customer data number etc all of this would be you know push to freshdesk for reference purposes so you know when your agents are looking at it you know they can go ahead and view everything so this is how it would look like a - just a step see required.
prospect,your a minute so you have a complete steps here to get all go ahead and fix it.
prospect,yep yeah an advantage of this is i know you guys are with ring central for three months some period of time i think we're obligated to use them but yeah some point we would probably just transition each other straight freshdesk this so it would be the same feel because the ringcentral creates a ticket just like the freshdesk does and then when you guys can drop ringcentral and swap or refresh those the only thing that to do is import that number again and that's it it's going to run the exact same way nobody's going to even notice the difference outside of they won't have to run the client.
prospect,so i don't think we have filled you in on this one day but i think we what we're talking about is we probably will be only using ringcentral for a short period of time than we would like to just use yours.
rep,you're sure i mean not a problem at all.
rep,i'll talk to her does that answer your question that part i don't underst yeah it's like we're saying i guess i mean it whatever voicemail audio clip or file is just stored in the same place everything else is right it's just data on the aws servers.
prospect,and is there i think but i also was asking for was about retention policy i think how long would that data be kept.
rep,oh so so as long as you have an account with freshdesk your data is going to be with us and even let's say you're moving from freshdesk and you want to take all your data with you a lot of softwares don't let you do that but freshdesk will allow you to do that so when you go to account settings you can export all of your data from freshdesk can take it with you so we're going to say in the future okay one more away from freshdesk we would be able to give you back all of your data.
prospect,let me ask it the reverse question is there a way to say we don't want to keep the data anything past 90 days just for example what we did all their way to have it removed after certain period of time?.
rep,so we saw not so there's no way of actually removing it right so unless you really probably i think there are some terms and agreements that you may have to probably sign up but what we could do is we could speak to our team so what would happen is let's say you don't want data past 90 days on ideas old data in your system so what they would do is so in the aw servers didn't have a separate section right so one each blade so what they can do it they'll be able to archive all of these into a separate section so all of these will be archived data.
prospect,but data i mean i'm mostly referring to this voicemail file not yeah yeah yeah i just i don't know what our lawyers want to do lawyers may want us to dump it after 90 days so we can say we don't have it look at.
prospect,currently our voicemail files are deleted after 30 days so it would be nice to be able to still do that but of course all the notes that we leave around the calls we still want that information saved.
rep,if you want to remove data from a service we'd be way to do that again.
prospect,please let's go today oh yeah so is this a soft so if we use therefore the same things like i saw so how's that work yeah it may cause exactly like a solid one okay and then.
prospect,if we ended up using or so each agent would have each agent making the outbound calls they have their own phone number they have extensions or how that work if we use here?.
rep,so i until they have complete access to the number so all incoming calls would ring on the phone so i'll go also to make outbound calls they can just use one single numbered show you so each given point of time you can make multiple calls from using this.
prospect,idiom beginning physical back they will yeah pena they were going to independent numbers but today they need to have direct in dial numbers or gonna just have an extension people balance oh yeah they can just do extension i think it might be.
rep,yeah you can you can do extensions.
rep,to yeah okay cool also for system on that way it all stays in unisons and then just give it like extension one through twelve or something like that so sounds like this kind of works the same as mitchell as far as on the numbers okay we don't really need game.
rep,yeah also freshdesk is available on the app so for your agents download the past app so let's say they're moving away from their desk or their computers you probably grab a cup of coffee or something like that but let's say they would want to make a call attend an incoming call so they can also always you know toggle from attending and making calls from the browser to their phones and they can make calls directly from their cell phones  using the freshdesk.
prospect,i don't know actually is there a way for the agents to be set that they're not available for inbound calls?.
rep,yep so they can just toggle this off and they will not be available to involved.
prospect,and then that prevents me hold somebody always receiving calls.
prospect,right yeah well it sounds like they will always anyway be okay.
prospect,i mean if all of this is i mean all of the agents you know turned it off or audio cards automatically just going to go to one voicemail.
prospect,yep yeah that's what you want and then especially because if you do the extensions and they're all signed into the extensions that have a main number they get that specific call type will never receive the call and i'll always keep stored in the voicemail and like you guys currently have it set for.
prospect,okay one point i actually like especially for you guys hey can you show them really quickly the reporting side of this so they can see a how that will look like?.
rep,yeah sure so do you want the helpdesk in-depth report or i want to get to that one.
prospect,i'll be okay but and then we can shown the phone summary afterwards this is specifies if that's what they're mainly using.
rep,sure so helpdesk in depth report will give you an overall inside of the helpdesk right so you know how many tickets are you're saying why email go to but i think in your case you're going to use fresh that's only especially for phone so you can see how many phone calls are coming in or how many have been on you know oh and priority high speed by you know type all of this.
rep,you can also see the average response time so how long agents taking to give out the first response of making you know call back of the average resolution time the first assigned time so once they receive a ticket and then you know your transcribers go through it how how long does it take for them to assign it to the outbound caller.
rep,so you'll be able to view that you don't spill it put a cross type and product.
rep,again your first response sla it so based on the sla that you set so what is the first responders layer by source priority all of this can be seen.
rep,and also when you want to let's say it says shipping and you know our returns our delivery is you know thirty-three percent compliant so when i click on it i can also see which are the tickets that have been complete at this rate.
rep,so when i say you know low priority they are fifty percent compared to what are the tickets in low-priority better you know sla compliant.
rep,so we can drill down more on that you can also create your own filter so any custom fields that you create within a ticket so you can select all of those as well and generate reports on them so you can generate reports for an individual agent group don't see their individual performances and you can also create scheduled so let's say you want this report to be you know send to you or since you're a manager so you know let's say every monday at you know at 10:00 a.m or 11 am you want to report to be automatically generated so you wouldn't need to get get into the freshdesk system freshdesk will automatically send these reports.
prospect,it is one you can go and can you show them phone summary yeah.
rep,there we go.
rep,so the phone summary will give you insights and you know number of calls that are coming in number number of outbound calls you're making only calls were transferred how long do you know how long were your agent speaking with the customers what is the average handling time are they able to resolve the calls oh you know total duration etc and again even on the phone summary we'd be able to filter down by incoming and outgoing calls business hours groups all.
prospect,yes that'll be great.
rep,will there be a way to see so there's the voicemails that are coming in just through the main line but will we also be able to see a report on say any voicemails that come in on a direct you know through an extension directly to an agent would we be able to break that down? but that works okay can you go back to the phone summary really quickly please.
rep,it off but but what is that what's that saying sandy she on average handles a call every 32 seconds has received six calls in this time period of one day as answered 100% of them and the average call duration are three minutes.
prospect,but i'm assuming that six calls means that she just pulled six from the queue right so but what about if she leaves her personal number and extension a mother personal number and extension number even yeah that she remembers is just that break that out.
rep,yeah just to verify if you click on sandy can you see what's incoming and outgoing or can you see see.
rep,right now all of these are incoming when i click on going out be able to see all of sandy's outgoing so these are the outgoing calls.
rep,okay it's two different reports but you can automate that like you showed you again.
rep,and you can also create a view very similar be a you know tickets you can just name this as outgoing call report right yeah and see and when i'm going to drill down so will show you all the other reporters at it.
rep,yep and also we have agent performance reports where you can see you know for ye th and you know our how many calls how many tickets are the handling or what is their first response sla all of this and you know average respondents lee this will give you an overall idea they first contact resolution so on just making one call table this over ticket or is that and this is give you a overall order put you want to filter down more on let's say the source or we can just choose the source as form and we'll show you the phone related data a lot so in your case i would be all the tickets.
prospect,it so yeah yes so this reports only up output of all in csv or give you pdf there's just csv files for exporting it.
rep,would be csv but if you want uh so tickets on on an overall so we can also be done as pdf but let's say if you want all the tickets right so example i go to all my tickets so if you want to export them in you know excel as well so we have an export option radio directly on their tickets so they will be able to choose if you wanted at csv excel what is the data within the ticket that you want imported is it all your data or just now selected data alone so you can choose that as well okay i want just to come me subjects source description and probably the agent name or something like that right so we can just export that out of freshdesk.
rep,okay yep so you can choose that's.
prospect,let's talk about the pricing a little bit or how you break that down i'm assuming it's by it agent or do can you talk a little bit about that or how did you sell it in packages or what's here i don't really haven't really looked at your pricing.
rep,okay so these are the different pricing we have and you know i think so if you want i think the blossom if you're going to be just using the phone channel especially if you're just ticketing you know you could just stick with the blossom plan but if you also want since you want the outbound callers to be also dynamically notified so you need dynamic email notifications as available in garden so i mean i would you know leave that up to you it so if it's gonna be automated so either blossom again i really don't see a you know any usage of you know estate or forest.
prospect,what's good time zones thing under estate i get notifications oh.
rep,come on time zone correctly tower offices in you know you have offices in europe in australia in asia.
prospect,oh and where where the agents are located gotcha okay exactly yeah yeah we don't need that.
rep,and then that's just a straight so each time assuming that each transcriber and each agent making outbound call would be considered an agent as far as cost goes correct so anyone who logs in and yeah yeah yeah okay yeah.
prospect,i mean that's got a question about the under forestry listed some they called ip white listing what is that used for in that context.
rep,so i feel like this thing and nothing butts on the security so so we can sometimes restrict you know what i need customers only from these ip ranges to submit the tickets to my freshdesk.
rep,so a lot of companies have the only those companies with those ip ranges would be able to submit tickets into the freshdesk.
prospect,like for example if i had agents that were working out of their house or something i want to make sure it's secure and they were only coming from one exactly its own location.
rep,okay look i want ip addresses.
prospect,yeah okay we don't need that.
rep,all right perfect so uh so suggest and you know caesar how are we looking i shall be a sign up for a free trial with freshdesk.
prospect,we did sign up for free trial i haven't given ceaser at or jessica access to that so i think we need to kind of play around with it a little bit more is that what you're asking.
rep,okay uh okay perfect so yeah so i mean even also on your file so let's say you want to test out any plan so you can move to any plan on the freshdesk system and you know test it out so there's no restrictions on that so any trial - you know if you want to probably if you want to just find a comfort i stock like chat or something like that you can always you know try out any plan on your trial and so if you need any assistance as well just let us know you know so i think on the email or calendar invite that we just sent you for the demo you'd have my first name address as well as jacko's so you know just feel free to email any of us directly and you'd be able to you know help you.
rep,okay great thank you i think that's it and then we'll will ya look good over and reach out to you just as soon as we have ourselves organized.
prospect,i i would say end of the week.
rep,yeah friday would be good.
rep,welcome to zoom.
rep,the meeting has not started please stay online.
rep,enter your participant id followed by pound otherwise just press pound to continue.
rep,you are in the zoom meeting now.
rep,there are one participants in the meeting.
rep,hello oh hey is this kevin.
rep,kevin are able to hear me?.
rep,muted not able to hear anybody's voice.
rep,hi guys are you guys able to hear me? hello.
rep,no but someone is dialed into it right.
rep,hello hello there's no response.
rep,when you're dropping an email.
rep,yeah sure.
rep,hello yeah hi kevin you there.
rep,oh hey kevin oh looks like you are connected but.
rep,kevin can you hear me.
prospect,yes i can.
rep,oh hey kevin this is jay from freshdesk.
rep,how are you doing today?.
prospect,good how about you?.
rep,yeah i'm doing good.
rep,thanks so.
rep,yes i was just telling me that you would join the long link that we had sent yesterday.
rep,all good kevin so are we ready to go waiting for anybody else for my team.
prospect,so i was going to have a couple of other people join but they got called away by an emergency.
prospect,so it'll be just a today and then after you know i make my recommendations.
prospect,they will let me know or i'll let them know whether we're going to schedule an additional demo for a larger group.
rep,all right sure so uh so - wanna be just the both of us today right.
rep,all right perfect.
rep,all right kevin.
rep,oh yeah so these are briefly explained about the requirements that you had you know with respect to freshdesk.
rep,in what you're interested in?.
rep,so before we start today is there anything in specific that you like - you know see you want me to cover.
prospect,yeah so one of the things that we saw on your website that we're interested in is integration with with skype.
prospect,so we have like different groups that we set up for our different customers to interact with our account managers and skype and so we wanted to know if you know we can capture that in your product or not.
rep,all right so.
prospect,i guess the first question though as far as the skype goes is it is do you do do you work with just a regular free skype or only the enterprise skype.
rep,so so we actually have two types of skype actually we also have a skype cti.
rep,so we can integrate sites using the cti we have and also the other skype we have is the skype for business right.
rep,so we integrated with both yeah.
prospect,so what is this so we don't have skype for business what is that cti?.
rep,so we also have the regular skype so that you know everybody else uses right.
rep,so you can use the regular skype integration and with skype it's also a native integration.
rep,okay but i'm just going to ask me speaking and what also just gonna go ahead and share my screen with you so it's a lot easier.
rep,are you able to view my screen.
rep,yes alright so this is our apps marketplace so under admin apps so you would find all the apps that we integrate natively with.
rep,so so when you go ahead and you know type skype.
rep,so we already built the integration with skype and it's ready to use right.
rep,so when all you need to do from your end is when you hit install or ask you for your skype credentials and the integration is going to be made.
rep,so this is all the steps will ask you field names so we'll pull out all the information that you need from skype is alright so.
rep,we can initiate a video call directly from within freshdesk using skype and also you know other options like now you can you know have a screen share etc and all of this would be you know log down to the same ticket that that particular customer is involved in.
rep,so example if you have a customer named jake so you know you could have a skype call with them and once the call is ended that entire conversation or the screen share would be part of that ticket for you know jake.
prospect,so when you say the entire conversation does that mean that like for an audio meeting that it would capture the audio from it?.
rep,um no it would capture the conversation.
rep,it would not record the entire audio.
rep,so we'd say you know a call duration it would give you all the details off that meeting okay.
prospect,so if as i had said that we were using skype as more of like a instant messenger will will your product people capture that.
rep,yeah absolutely so if it's going to be a message all the messages would be captured but the skype recording would not be captured because that is something that is that belongs to skype privacy policy so that is something we will not be able to capture.
rep,but all the other details like contacts name address phone number etc all the other details requester information would be captured your resort for your skype contact.
rep,okay exactly that contact we you know.
prospect,if there's a conversation between two people on skype then it would capture that that entire conversation.
rep,yes that's right.
prospect,and there's nothing for the user to have to copy and paste from.
rep,no it will be directly from within freshdesk right so good automate it will be automatically mapped already.
prospect,okay and so does the user have to i guess all the all the users would have to be on on your product and then and then initiate their skype through freshdesk is that right.
rep,yes skype and we already have the integration built out with just ask for your credentials and you know once you key in in credentials the integration will be automatically built.
rep,and same goes with the jira i understand that jira is also something that you are interested in okay.
rep,for jira again it will work the same way right so when you say geo so so you would need to put in your you know domain for your jira account are you username password.
rep,and what are the things that you'd like to do and sync with jira so that's most important.
rep,so when you wanna so for example when issues status is updated i would want to add a you know a private note in freshdesk publish know like an update a status.
rep,so with jira at the two-way integration so anything any changes that happen or you know within jira and freshdesk would be you know there will be a two-way conversation.
rep,so if someone update status or i want to add the comment in jira for the issue that you're linking it will also update and you know it added as a private note in freshdesk.
rep,and you can also sync the attachments one so if there's any attachments that need to be sync you could go ahead and do that as well .
rep,so for example now let's say i receive this sample ticket right.
rep,if i want to have you know escalate this i want to put this across my developers in jira.
rep,so you want to integrate it with freshdesk you would find jira integration right here.
rep,so all you need to do is link an issue it will ask you for you know the project the issue type and you know the folder and you can create an issue.
rep,so once you create an issue in freshdesk you'd find all of that within jira as well.
rep,okay so the create create asking you for the project.
prospect,so let's see if there is no project that it links to necessarily.
prospect,so it's you know bug that was found.
prospect,on jira they would be project rights so you would need to create categories and folders.
rep,okay so it would go into our product support.
prospect,project setup so but.
rep,yeah so that is that is what the project is an issue type so this account actually i linked it with an old jira account.
rep,so but this is reflect within jira as also for freshdesk and this is jira instance and since that is purely just used for testing purposes so so this is how it would look like with in jira for.
rep,let's say i'm an agent so i would see all the it get assigned to me and these are all freshdesk tickets right.
rep,so i can see it's an example i just open up this ticket.
rep,so you know all the changes that happen within this ticket you know what the priority is low so i can view the workflow and if i add you know something here at a work log and you know comment except for all of this would again be reflecting back in freshdesk.
prospect,okay all right that's okay.
rep,and it's a two-way integration that and similarly so also other other apps that you want to integrate with right anything.
prospect,so when you say you know internal messaging etc so you can integrate with slack.
rep,so so you can always use our app store because you know you know we already built integrations and these are ready to be used apps so if you want to link your crm system you know monitoring like you know from jira all of this is just one click install.
rep,for example if you wanna you know have sugar crm installed so all you need to do is just hit install you know key in the credentials for sugar crm and it will put all the data data it's comes here ok.
prospect,and it is the slack integration two way as well?.
rep,oh yeah so how we would so this two terms so we have slack integrations for both the older version of slack and for the newer version.
rep,so the same so how we would you know use slack is so using our automations infrastructure so we would be able to push data to slack you know as direct messages to agents or you know private messages using private channel or different groups in slack right.
rep,so so these are the actions that we can use.
rep,so and you can also use freshdesk to create ticket slack commands to convert all the dm you know in slack to freshdesk tickets.
rep,so it's kind of a two-way integration that way as well so.
prospect,but you're pushing pushing everything it's not not automated.
rep,how the push is only from you know from freshness to slack.
rep,because we need to do you know define what are the tickets that need to be pushed right.
rep,so they could be specific tickets that you want to push the slack.
rep,so that's see only.
prospect,and then once that has been pushed to slack then anything else that's commented on in slack. that would be a reflecting back in freshdesk as well.
prospect,and then going back to jira for a second once that once that integrations made is there you know anything that has to be done on either jira or on freshdesk to to get you know to keep that sync happening.
prospect,i know it's an automatic sync and so that's where you define the sync updates righty.
rep,okay yeah.
rep,your define it in the very beginning so what are the things that you want to happen so we are click so these are your jira actions and these are freshdesk actions.
rep,and what is it you know you know the so it's a two integration so when something is changed in jira what what do you want happening in freshdesk and something happens inverse .
rep,that's what do you want happening in jira so it okay yeah.
prospect,and you have to do that for for every time.
rep,this is just a one-time config.
rep,and once we've saved and you know saved .
rep,okay i would be apply for you know got it off the admin.
rep,and then the different apps those are just free apps to others.
rep,completely free app so this basically our marketplace.
rep,so all of these are ready to be used apps integrate with any.
prospect,okay okay all right all right.
rep,so uh so i also notice then i was told that you're moving from zendesk to freshdesk. is that right?.
prospect,that's yeah what we're considering right.
rep,so uh so what the current channels you have configured in zendesk.
rep,so is it just email a phone chat or is there anything else like it or do you also have a portal.
prospect,i really don't know i'm sorry.
prospect,i'm uh i'm kind of kind of new to the company.
rep,so alright that's alright so yeah so you could tune you can configure email your you know live chat all of this with freshdesk because well so.
rep,integrating live chat is again very simple.
rep,so you know we can define how your chat should look like we can have a visitor form so they should fill out this form before they initiate a chat we can have preferences as you know when you would want and where you want this chat to be enabled.
rep,we can have a chat routing and let's say you don't want to have this on your support portal but you want to have your chat enable on your website or any webpage.
rep,for example on lets say on your site ah when i go to you know probably you know let me go to page where.
rep,okay let me just go to key features right so let's say on this particular page i want chat enabled so i can go ahead and just do a copy-paste of the code i have here which is ready to use.
rep,so when i hit widget code so you already have the code scripted for you.
rep,so all you need to do is just copy paste this code and the chat would be available for you.
rep,and the chat in real time again.
rep,so for example when i go to know so when i go to my e-commerce portal so this is my portal would look like so this is my support portal.
rep,so on my support portal then i have a solution articles with my customers can search for solution articles they can go ahead and submit a ticket if needed.
rep,and here i have my chat as well.
rep,so i can go ahead and initiate a chat.
rep,hi i need help or anything of that sort right.
rep,it's the chat is again are in real time.
rep,okay so if you could scroll back up on that that page we were just looking at.
prospect,uh-huh.
prospect,the submit ticket part of it can you can you show me that.
rep,so on on this submit ticket the different categories that you have there or those configurable .
rep,yeah i mean this entire ticket form is configurable right.
rep,okay i got all so for example i have dependent drop-down field so for example i have type of issues here and my next you know ticket for this product but actually when i'm going to go ahead and select my type of issues.
rep,for example i put payments and pricing i have different you know other fields populating up here when i quote you oh you know returns and refund i have more fields for other different field for other i have really other different so it's completely configurable.
rep,and also when i'm going to go ahead and put in a subject for my ticket when i me and i have this is a mandatory field so let's say i'm looking for you know orders or something at that one when i put in my subject freshdesk will also populate all the related articles based on my subject line.
rep,just the users another you know chance to look at all the solution articles you've created you know so that you know they have a self out kind of system and they don't reach out to you for you know every small thing that didn't have questions okay.
rep,yeah and also the best thing about freshdesk is it would also enable you to you know check the status of the tickets.
rep,for example let me just show you that right.
rep,so i'm going to go ahead to my portal yep so when i view this portal on my entitled as a login user you know when i you know submitted a few tickets i can also go ahead and check the status of those tickets as well okay so.
rep,like this is it together so that i could see in who the agent has been assigned to it you know what the status of these tickets are so it's also more it's more than a self serve system right so it would enable you to keep track of what's happening and i think that's what you want all the customers down right right.
prospect,so okay so that's what the customers would have the the place that like our account managers would log tickets would it be the same configuration is what what a customer would see or.
rep,um not really so these this is essentially this is an end and you know uh you know a front end portal that's you know available to say customers.
rep,if it's gonna be internal or tickets are being raised so your agents for example your account managers so they would create a ticket directly from your so they can raise new ticket and you know so this is the new ticket form here.
prospect,okay so that looks pretty similar to what we were looking at i assume that it's completely configurable as well.
rep,good well yeah okay and also if you want some of these fields that you've created you know automatically you know populated.
rep,so you know for certain issues you may have some fields of pre-populated right.
rep,so we can have certain templates as well for that.
rep,example what i'm going to put mobile refund i have a lot of these fields already on a populated yeah.
rep,and also my description it's all the way auto populates you know so this is my mobile refund ticket for everything i have a tag and description all of these automatically already populated.
rep,all i need to do is just you know put the requester whoever it is in in my name so yeah so and i can go ahead hit submit it i have the ticket created.
prospect,it's awesome.
rep,so you create these templates too you know so that all of your ticket property is here within the ticket they are kind of populated automatically.
prospect,yeah okay all right.
rep,perfect so uh also.
rep,so when you said phone so what exactly is a phone system that you're currently using and you know to me not help me with the number of calls you receive in a day.
prospect,i don't have the number of calls but we do have 800 numbers that that our customers can call in to.
prospect,and i guess that was one of our questions i know i saw on your website that you can buy phone numbers through your company can we use our own 800 numbers.
rep,yeah absolutely right.
rep,so so with freshdesk you can buy a number so it can be both you know a local number or toll-free 1-800 number.
rep,so but let's say you want to retain your same number so once you put in freshdesk we have our dedicated support team will assist you with the process of porting your existing number.
rep,so you would your customers would still be calling in you on the same number but you would be using you know our phone system into their existing phone system so it's just a you know coating that you do very similar the.
rep,for example if you want to move from at&t to verison.
rep,so there is a process to do that pulling it so it's a same way or.
prospect,so okay.
rep,and you know once you have the number within freshdesk we can you know go ahead and elaborately setup you know an ivr system you know so.
rep,for example you know press one for sales or two for support etc.
rep,you can have menus and you can have key presses within those menus to call the agents you know directly.
rep,so this could be like extensions etc.
rep,and we also have you know you have your settings where in freshdesk you will be able to record all of your phone calls as well so.
rep,or any phone conversation is happening so you can record all of those conversations yeah you have them you know your other functionalities like a transcript wait music hold music how many calls could be in a queue at any given point of time based on the volume your non availability messages when you want to accept your phone calls you know all the other phone settings.
rep,and also voicemail is a very important feature that we use so the voicemail feature what that would do is let's say a customer calls in drops in a voicemail.
rep,freshdesk would automatically convert that voice man into a ticket and that ticket would also contain the recording off the entire voicemail.
rep,so when you open that ticket up so you can actually listen to the entire conversation.
rep,you know the voicemail recording and you know your customer your agents can get back to it.
rep,and on the dashboard we also have you know your available agents who is available on your system at that point of time now how many agents are you know available to answer tickets how many agents are available to answer phone.
rep,so when i see you know i have 10 agents not accepting phone calls as an administrator you can actually force them to accept phone calls.
rep,so i can just turn on the phone answering capabilities for them.
rep,yeah if any as an administrator and also you would have your phone uh you know summary dashboard where you know you could see the entire call history of you.
rep,know how many you know who stopped can and which agent there's any ongoing calls.
rep,you can you know this view all of that information so this is where who it's wrecked if the phone calls is recorded so when i hit play i can actually listen to the entire conversation.
rep,this will allow you to make and receive calls.
rep,okay so you can listen to these conversations yep so yeah so that's how it works.
rep,yeah so so i think with that a top i hope i give it a quick summary of freshdesk.
rep,oh.
rep,is there anything else in particular that you want to see today.
rep,yeah i guess i had a couple more questions.
prospect,so can you create a support ticket via email?. you know without being logged into the the freshdesk system.
rep,yeah absolutely so once you have an email configured within freshdesk.
rep,so let's say you have one supporting email address lets say for example this is the email address i have here right so i have this configured within the freshness system.
rep,so any email i send to this particular email address uh it would automatically get created as a ticket.
rep,so as your customer so for example so when i look at the my tickets.
rep,so you would find you know all the emails plus anything that happens also let's say you receive a general ticket right.
rep,like from one of your customers.
rep,so all you need to do is just forward that particular email to your configured email address and it would you know come as a ticket.
prospect,okay so we also have a couple different domains okay. could we you know use multiples so we you know one one would be you know help@ mitigator another one might be help@ you know what that's something else.
rep,if you know a new multiple email addresses you of course okay double impressed that we have you know support@freshdesk.
rep,com sale@freshdesk.
rep,com.
rep,how many and the best part is you know or we also you know uh you know setting up the entire email setup you can also assign these directly to group.
rep,so example i'm going to say no sale that you know mitigator .
rep,com that it is my email address i can directly assign all emails that are coming through this email address to my sales team.
rep,i can create a group within freshdesk okay i can say who are the agents who belong to that group right.
rep,i can write get them.
rep,so this is where you go to you can create groups in freshdesk alright.
rep,so for example i have a marketing team so inside the marketing team and have a jay and bob monica raghav sandy so any ticket thats coming that's coming into the marketing team is going to go to these six people and i've also set up automatic ticket assignment in a round-robin way which not between nothing but you know let's say i have eight tickets coming in the first one will go to a jay to anther to bob for to monica you know six to sandy and the seventh one and again go back to a jay.
rep,so we can also have it as a load balancing manner.
rep,so let's say i'm going to say each agent in my marketing group can handle you know about let's say six tickets at a given point of time.
rep,so if ajay and bob monica and sandy already have six tickets you know in the queue that they handling and raghav just has two so raghav would be getting the next few tickets you know.
rep,so that's a load balancing so you can also set up automatic ticket assignment and within the group itself so let's say for ticket is unassigned in a in a group or in their in their particular sales queue for you no more than 30 minutes or you know an hour.
rep,we can also escalate it probably to their managers.
rep,let's says if chandler's a manager i am going to escalate to mr.
rep,chandler right so we can have all of these set up as well so.
rep,there are a lot of you know minor detail then you know when you drill down more there's a lot of options that you will see.
rep,because what i'm giving you is away or overview and generic you know the first you know probably of a basic demo because i know is first time you seen the system so i'm not getting too much into the details but i guess the things you can do.
prospect,another question on the live chat can we have multiple agents on a single chat at the same time?.
rep,ah.
rep,no but you would be able to transfer the chat to another agent.
rep,and also within a ticket what do you can do is so let's say you receive a ticket wait so you can collaborate internally with multiple people on a particular ticket as well.
rep,so you can either add note and you can notify one single person.
rep,so let's say i want a chandler to be you know notified about this ticket i could take you know hi chandler and you know please look at this.
rep,and i can notify just him and he'll know what i'm talking about because he'll know the ticket details who the requestors are of that etc.
rep,i cannot discuss this is a group so when i hit discuss so i can say you know what i need you know chandler bob and you know gb hey guys i need some help on this.
rep,you know could you please help me?.
rep,hey so i kind of opening up a discussion within this specific ticket so i can start collaborating with all my other members.
prospect,okay all right.
rep,i can do that.
rep,it's alright again.
rep,so any other questions i'm sure you got a lot.
prospect,and the other the other thing as you know we were looking at like deploying the chat on a particular domain can we do that on multiple domains.
rep,yeah absolutely so you can you know so it's just a copy-paste right.
rep,as i told you right right so just copy paste it on as many web pages as you like.
prospect,all right and then someone in my group asked about trello integration is that one of the.
rep,yep absolutely so so how are they trying to get trello integrated with freshdesk.
rep,i mean i'm just curious you know what
rep,this is the first i even heard that our company has trello or is using it so i guess i'm just asking the question on whether whether it's an available integration and then we can go.
prospect,i honestly think that you know this company has been adding things without really thinking about what else we have because it seems like what what they're doing in trello they could easily be doing in jira.
prospect,so i you know i'm hoping that maybe we can can take a step back and look at getting rid of a couple of these things.
rep,yeah perfect so with trello so we would use our third-party integrator so that is zapier so we have trello integration as well.
rep,so where was interesting for you you can go back to them a yes it is available so how you do that is you know you could select trello in either freshdesk or freshdesk in trello and you could check the actions and create that stuff so.
rep,okay yeah so these are all the triggers and actions that you can do co can happen they almost do all of it.
rep,and i mean trello something that be used to use as well internally.
rep,we stopped we found it a clunky.
rep,so right i thought i was very curious off you know actually surprising you know seeing someone say trello for a long time.
prospect,i know i agree i agree.
prospect,another thing i want to ask is just about the search ability of tickets.
rep,so there's a global search.
rep,so for example i'm going to put out of it.
rep,so what did we do is we've categorize it so we would search for order that particular keyword search for order that particular keyword in subjects and content for my tickets for all my solutions for my forum is different how many and also on their customers.
rep,so it's a global search or you can search for a ticket id any you know any probably message on you know oh a ticket anything ever.
rep,for this example i put asad they sure it should come up so good it would search literally i wanted everything within a ticket and you can sort by you know date created last modified etc.
rep,freshdesk you know show me.
rep,alright let's see.
rep,a long time someone asked me about the search functionality okay because you know search is something but you know a lot of people use on a day to day basis think salespeople and support you know guys and so what i understand though in importance of having search.
rep,companies either it is just man the ticket you know they just you know it's answer ticket they just create views for themselves.
rep,for example if a man i just create a view just for myself and you know and i could just call it and tickets.
rep,and every day when i log in a freshdesk i will just be you know kind of just using this and just viewing this view announcing ticket set on my cue.
rep,but it's always great.
rep,and also when i'm sometimes when i'm on this agent training session always encourage agents you know let's say you receive a ticket about a particular issue always great to search because there could be another agent within your same system and within your freshdesk system that would have also received a similar issue.
rep,and you know with that same subject you know that particular keyword so you could get some ideas and tips about it.
rep,okay so talk someone .
prospect,so you just mentioned training is that does that come with the with the system.
rep,oh yeah so the entire implementation and training and onboarding is done free of cost in freshdesk within freshdesk since i'm your account manager and you know so i know technical account manager as well so i would be you know also kind of handling the entire on loading as well as the training.
rep,so okay just let me know when you you know if you do need training for your admins or just a agents and yeah sure you know we could always set that up and you know get that going as well okay.
rep,so the rest of a team also need to be kind of involved in this.
rep,so i mean if they need another demo as well so we can always let you know get that fixed as well.
prospect,yeah i think that in the next demo you know to really be able to show the product interacting with skype is going to be important our executive team it was really focused on on that.
prospect,uh-huh so i guess the other thing i just wanted to ask about was was pricing.
rep,uh-huh.
prospect,so we were we have zendesk.
prospect,i think that a lot of people don't don't like it them some of us here have just used jira for helpdesk tickets in in the past.
prospect,and so there's you know a faction that's asking why why don't we just use jira for that why you know.
prospect,why buy another another package.
rep,.
rep,its very interesting i mean though so so i think you told me a lot of points right now.
rep,so to answer your first question is so when you say a lot of you know customer a lot of people not liking zendesk yeah.
rep,so i mean i've heard that a lot is really because it's really complicated sometimes to use right and we honestly i've have i've had so many customers moving from zendesk.
rep,but we actually got fed up after a point because we've we have so many data migration that we needed to do that we've actually gone ahead and build own custom plug.
rep,so if you have any data that you want to move from zendesk you actually created this right here within our own system.
rep,i think you see a lot of companies do that.
rep,always directly import your data and ended your second question be.
rep,you know internally we have developers and you know engineers as well who who use jira but how we use jira is more of a bug tracking if there's any issue within a product so we would raise it and they would work on it.
rep,but you know freshdesk is more for end customer facing solution system.
rep,that's completely different at the entire interface changes as well.
rep,so yeah so that's the difference and coming to plans and billing so so these are the different plans we have so yeah.
rep,so based on you know what you're trying to use.
rep,so anything from chat so i would suggest just you know sticking with the garden plan and above that would be a great pick.
rep,our yeah so i mean i would leave to that choice to you it's become i'm not a sales guy i am not here to sell you on anything so.
rep,i'm just a technical consultant so honestly.
rep,yeah so you would uh you could go ahead and choose which ever plan suits you best.
rep,so yeah so i could always help you picking but in picking plan but yeah so but you know from based on what i hear and you know from the requirements i really think anything from garden and about should do the trick.
rep,and so what what do we get you know what's the difference between these difference between between garden estate and forest .
rep,these so it's just given you it's a these are the additional features that you will have.
rep,so example you'd have we know full portal customizations you know role-based dashboards for multi product you would have  ip white listing in forest custom mailed servers data center location yeah.
rep,so you can choose of these right.
rep,so these are additional features that are part of each of these plan so yeah so based on your requirements each company would have their own.
rep,so yep.
rep,you could choose whichever plan you feel is the right fit and yep so.
prospect,and then can you just define an agent for me.
rep,also when i say agent so anybody who's going to be logging into the freshdesk system.
rep,i'm saying the ticket so they would be agent so anyone raising a ticket outside of the freshdesk system but there would just be a requester.
rep,so we're not going to charge you on that so you can have you know hundreds of thousands of customers and we're not going to charge you based on that it's just going to be the agents who are working within the system.
rep,so only they would know the agents.
prospect,so for example i am a product manager you know i might be interested in looking at what's in that queue but wouldn't be doing any work on tha.
prospect,so would i be considered an agent or what i have access to be able to view a dashboard or a queue or anything like?.
rep,that if you're going to be you know exiting the system viewing that boards viewing all tickets you would still be an agent.
rep,so because i know because on the calendar i saw a bunch of people who are supposed to join the call so you know so i'm sure you know they would want to see the system as well so just let me know when when you know that's a good time and you know we could go ahead and schedule the call for the rest of the team and not always if you would you know probably first explained to your team you know as to what you saw on the demo and never the painpoints or other things that you found interesting.
rep,and you don't want to share that feedback with me so i could probably you know let's get another call and drive that demo based oh you know purely on your requirements and what you'd want to focus on that demo.
prospect,okay that sounds good.
prospect,and and so just going back to those different different pricing tiers i guess what i'm wondering is you know how how can can can you start off with you know one plan and then move to another plan.
rep,yeah absolutely yeah of course.
rep,so let's say you want to start off with garden and you know down the line you feel you need to requirement you know probably a full customization or a bunch of other features and lets say you can always upgrade your plan to estate or forest.
prospect,okay yep okay.
prospect,we're young company so we may want to to grow into some of these higher tiers.
rep,all right very good.
rep,perfect so i said right that decision and call is completely yours so yeah ofcourse.
rep,so yeah so you could discuss internally with your team and you know let's get back to me.
rep,okay no on you know when we could schedule the next demo for the rest of it so we could go ahead and plan that.
rep,alright then.
prospect,great.
rep,so see us i look forward to you know or hearing back from you and i also have a left asia you know follow up with you.
rep,you know to fix the next demo date for us okay yeah so let's take it forward from there.
rep,okay pretty good thanks very much.
rep,all right great was thank thank you so much to kevin it was great talking you and i hope the demo was useful.
prospect,so yeah it was thanks you know we were kind of poking around on online on youtube and so forth and you know those things get out of date pretty quickly.
rep,not factory on the store subdomain after.
rep,yep got it so it's still the business model awesome so can you alex give me like 60 second background on what specifically has transpired that where our customer experience study became interesting to you you wanted to learn more about it anything in particular you can share so what i can do is i can focus my conversation and findings in that context um.
prospect,yeah sure i mean you know ecommerce is a difficult place to to survive in these days it's a saturated market place and dominated by some pretty recognize easy to recognize players you know and and so here we are factory alice stored not not an amazon or a walmart but doing okay and what we hope is to continue to grow and do even better so you know we're at a point now in our in our business where we're starting to take a closer look i'm dig a little bit deeper you know that the fruit isn't as low-hanging anymore and so we're having to get a little bit more i guess efficient or better and more specific things that we're doing on our site you know such as our split testing and my email marketing and our ppc marketing and so on so and one of the places where we think there may be opportunity is in our site search so this is you know searches isn't i guess it's our business but it is in our business right and we're not we're not we know have a team of scientists here that are devoted to this and we're hoping to leverage a third party service who who does have those kind of search resources behind them without having to reinvent the wheel ourselves so we have a server it works okay maybe it works great i don't know it's just but you know what we're doing now is going through this exercise you know if we if doing well we don't know we need to compare it against something so let's take a look at a couple of services out there maybe we can split test this and see are we doing well look we'd be doing a little bit better or could we be doing a ton better all right so the reason why we've so far engage unboxed.
rep,okay all right perfect so let me let me share with you what we have done so here's what the analysis that we've done can you still see my screen alex.
prospect,yep moving your mouse over peter.
rep,okay let me there we go that shows up does that work.
rep,okay perfect so i think one of the key pieces was i remember the name of the gentleman it was i think igor is that correct .
rep,is he still around or .
prospect,no no.
rep,okay so what we did was and i think unfortunately we we should have done this slightly differently we should have picked one of the subdomains because here there is no search box per se you have to go to a subdomain to actually pick one so we did actually do that i believe at some point so to make sure where did we go so there was that yeah i just want to make sure that we did a good job here because we then give our team a specific set of instructions to talk to the customers with or talk to this focus group with let me walk you through what we've done and if there seems to be some gaps here we'll run the test again but no please when i give you get to the feel for what this is and what we've done so far so what the premise of this is that we want to make sure we we figure out how your users or your customers are actually discovering products on the site right and and our strength is that that is what our expertise is to understand and decipher what the issues might being with product discovery .
rep,so we hired 425 focus group participants we gave them the site and we gave them three tasks we didn't tell them how to perform those tasks but they then judge themselves and then we measured what they did based on that now the measurement was either positive or negative if it was negative we've distributed into three levels severe moderate or mild and negative been it was it's some sort of an interruption right so severe was a enough to disrupt the flow and mild was it was an annoyance but they could still proceed through that annoyance and here's the five stages that we analyzed the customer on so discovery stage selection comparison check out and return stage now the caveat here is it will it says checkout if we are not saying the how long it takes for somebody to check out it is still in the context of product discovery because that is the only place where we have expertise even if we thought that it took a long time for somebody to checkout me couldn't tell me why or what alright what is it that you're gonna do about it but what we have talked about is if somebody is checking out can they discover the right set of products at that time based on what your business requirements are and then the return stage is not returning products for the customer coming back to the site does that work for you does that make sense.
rep,okay i awesome so so first is the discovery stage obviously okay so we did this is unfortunate anyways so we did pick three tasks task one was espresso coffeemaker and you know obviously the customer response would be there is no search bar but that's the problem you should have picked one of the subdomains .
prospect,backward.
rep,so let me let me do this i mean walk you give you a very high level alex maybe we can do this report again but i want to ask you which would be the subdomain you'd record where you feel search is gonna be most helpful because i see some subdomains or you only have a few products i mean smaller number of products which say where it would make sense to do that.
prospect,yeah i mean if we if we're gonna take a sampling here um take that garmentile.
prospect,this one.
prospect,yep yep .
rep,and you could.
rep,yep yep so g dot back java store this one's good the  at&t tile which is just at&t dot or att factory outlet store dot com that's in the upper right now how big are these catalogs just to give me an idea nothing doesn't have to be an accurate number.
prospect,say i attained an aggregate around 50000 but on a per store basis i mean they could be it vary wildly so i don't know not sure.
 but then gone in and at&t have some significant number of products like a few hundred.
 oh yeah absolutely.
 g dot and att dot all right so let me just give you overview as to what we did here so task one was highly specific me give you a specific task let me look at the customer response and then we give you task 2 say noise cancelling headphones then we look at customer response and the customer response is essentially looking at it and saying did the customers search or did the customers use navigation or did the customers click on some banners and stuff like that and then if task three is low specific look for anything on this on the site for your choice right so what do most customers do in that case and then the idea is that once they get started on this journey how how do they follow through or the interruptions that they get so that's where the selection stage comes in here for highly specific where we said expresso coffee maker you can see from a navigation perspective what will the reaction be then four or some okay and then then we'll have the medium specific task we'll have the navigation for it again and then we'll also have search and then whether in super see here even for navigation it seems like there was some issues like over plantronics may not necessarily sell headphones but they do sell headphones do they.
rep,know your onix they do yeah.
rep,so for medium specific tasks for looking for noise cancelling headphones four out of ten clicked on plantronics with laying down the headsets category so the search parameters win all four users typed in noise cancelling headphones were shown zero results.
rep,so that was the one of the search results and on this tour four of them will abandon now obviously we paid these guys to be there so they didn't abandon but what they what the typically say is oh i don't know what to do or what should i do next when they ask those types of questions we know that if they were by themselves that they were all abandoned site then essentially one more thing that would you okay here's a lot of analysis around this but a low specific task maybe ask them to look for something specific so on samsung they look for camera and there was shown results for a battery homepage banners this type of product name instead of epilator she was shown zero results for spelling mistakes so instead of oh she typed it in he i wish we had done a more consistent job on this i apologize alex comparison stage this is the next stage where we now actually figure out and say okay now that you've moved  down to a product that you were looking for how do you actually buy next so they talked about you know how easy is wanting to see similar product recommendations the site did not show any and next was but they did say they were able to find all the information they were looking for very easily so if they have the real and they are true intends to buy and the preview page is doing its job in terms of providing all the details but if they have no intent to buy from any user experience perspective it's not very easy to navigate to the next level so if i find this particular product say abel planets headphones i want to see another set of headphones i have to go back and then click on the next product so to see second product i have to do almost three clicks right then the checkout stage was users were shown saying cross-sell recommendations on the card page as well as in the as well as in the process of the checkout so the idea is that if i was shown some popular new products and ones that i had in the basket i were considered buying them so that's you know user were not shown any recommendations on the checkout state so that was definitely a an opportunity and then the return stage this is something i personally had my experience on one of the other sites was saturday morning 8 o'clock i'm spending time on the site i spend almost half an hour kids come into the room eight hours passed by before i get back to the site i've already forgotten what i was looking at so we wanted to figure out what will the site do to help me get back to where i had left off so to recreate that scenario we asked all these focus group participants to sort of take a 15 minute break come back restart and to remember what they were looking to buy come back and find that product again and they still couldn't search they could still navigate they could still use whatever mechanism they want to use but unfortunately only two users were able to recall the products and they found it difficult to spot the ones they viewed earlier so recommendations recently view recommendations would definitely help for repeat customers and then we basically have all our customer feedback and suggestions based on that customer feedback as to how you can address and improve some of these pieces what is it that you need to look at and then we have all our key takeaways grouped by each stage so product discovery what happens selection stage checkout the <> cetera and that's the so if the customer experience study for you so alex one of the things what we can do is we're gonna repeat it with gene dot and an at&t dot works like specifically just looking at that assuming that a customer lands there directly and not even worried about the main factory outlet stores homepage.
prospect,okay yeah they think that would be helpful.
rep,yep okay would you like to schedule something for it will take us a few days to get the participants to the study and prepare the study is it possible for you to look at your calendar the feature give us some some availability .
prospect,yeah how about with this at the same time next week be too soon.
rep,possibly so the week after would be the best the week of the twenty nine what would that be still okay.
prospect,yeah my week tend to be loaded heavily up front so again i'd be looking at thursday that's march 3rd as being the next best day .
rep,is that ok with you.
prospect,yeah that's fine with me yeah ok .
rep,i just want to make sure that you are not on a time crunch to evaluate a provider i just want to make sure that you're playing.
prospect,on yeah yesterday if you're safely within the time frame we're we're just we're working through a few different a few different providers so and we're not we're not at any kind of a decision making phase right now it's all information gathering yourself.
prospect,that's good .
rep,all right so is it okay alex do requests maybe a hour-and-a-half timeframe rather than just an hour because this will take about 30 minutes to walk you through maybe 20 and then the other presentation might take the whole hour especially you might have some questions for you on that as well .
prospect,um yeah it's a pretty big chunk of time i mean if maybe maybe we can try to kill it in an hour and then okay at the end of that hour we can decide if we should circle back for a quick follow-up .
rep,got it so if it's okay with you what i'll try to do is we'll do the invite for like 15 minutes over just so that you know and if that's okay and even if we'll try to get get it done in the hour if not we at least have 15 minutes to this wrap up.
prospect,fair enough.
rep,okay hurry up thank you so much.
rep,all right i like so thank you so much again i apologize for this and but thank you for the opportunity and we really appreciate your flexibility you got it.
prospect,all right i'll talk to you guys soon.
rep,enter your participant you are in the zoom meeting now there.
rep,yeah i can hear you yeah.
rep,hi is it john?.
prospect,it is yes.
rep,hey john prateek here thank you so much for joining how are you doing today?.
prospect,i'm good just as a heads up i do have a hard stop at the top of the hour.
rep,so i will quickly introduce my team i have rohit joined from my team rohit would you like to do introduce yourself quickly.
rep,she hey john thanks for your time.
rep,john can you hear me properly?.
rep,yeah hey john i manage the honeywell engagement for brillio thanks very much for joining us i think prateek sent you a brief deck as well  so you know we will be will be going through that but before that you know let me just quickly introduce you know some of the other folks that we have on the call we have a chander.
rep,you know chander heads he is a part of the digital engineering  he's our chief architect as well so chander.
rep,thanks rohit hi john good to connect with you.
rep,so john so before we start right you know i would like to get a brief introduction about yourself as well so that you know we can get going from there.
prospect,so i'm honeywell it i run a small cloud team for our hps business.
rep,okay so is it for hps?.
prospect,correct.
rep,okay okay okay.
rep,so we are working with the hps you know the honeywell  productivity and productivity solution so we are working with the the you know earlier in intermec team which is part of the mobility practice and we are we are doing a lot of test test automation world for the mobility devices and and printer devices so that is one work we are doing we also you know getting engage in a data and analytics project you know pretty soon with the same team.
prospect,who you working with over there.
rep,so we're working with the venky.
rep,i think is name is shanti rasan venkatehan so that is so he owns the team under him we have here working with fermin who you know is our point of contact and this is with the team which is based out of lynnwood.
prospect,so to be clear i'm with honeywell process solutions not honeywell billing you know.
rep,okay okay okay so it's honewell process solutions and not hsps.
prospect,yeah it's different here.
rep,yeah i get it.
rep,thank you.
rep,so yeah so be having a relationship with honeywell and we're doing some projects there and i will check with the hsts team so thats the project i was referring to thanks  so what i will do is john i will give a quick introduction about brillio so that you know so that you know who we are and you know what our capabilities are and then then chander will be focusing around the cloud practice and you know what we do for our customers in the space.
rep,so first so you know i think you know if if you have the presentation with you john and i'm referring to slide number 4.
rep,so i think this is the right slide i believe you know to start this conversation you know about why they exist as an organisation  so brillio is a  company which is you know which is helping our customers in the digital transformation journey right and when we see you know why we are very focused here is because you know multiple multiple factors right because in the recent times you would have seen a lot of disruption happening there in the market a lot of changes going on right so the way you know customers engage the customer behaviour are changing the way customers are engaging with the organisation and vice versa has changed. the customer the way customers are buying products and services are changed right there are new start ups who are coming into the computer industry and completely disrupting and taking over the industry and also in a lot of data and analytics building or a date of floating around you know and thanks to cloud processing capabilities right? which which you know provide the ease of processing data at scale right. and which provides you know organizations you know it better insights about customers and you know so that they can reach to the customers in a more personalized manner right so we'd all these things it does become like a for the organization that are in scale you know it does become very difficult for them to adapt  quickly and you know change alright otherwise catching up with the speed has been very difficult that is there you know we as an organization you know we come into play we help our customers you know in there overall transformational journey.
rep,we have built some unique capabilities which i will be talking about you know in the areas of consulting you know cloud engineering experience you know application as well as data analytics and we bring these as a cumulative or you know we culminate these and you know provide provider as a service to a customer which which helps them to drive this and you know to catch this wave and take it forward.
rep,so that is what that is the reason why they exist today.
rep,with all these capabilities that we have built we help them to compete you know better and faster.
rep,right and we will also hear from us.
rep,from a presence standpoint we are global company we work with it over you know fortune 500 customers across the globe having presence in the us primarily headquatered in in santa clara and california and then you know we have other regional offices and you know delivery centers as well and we have offshore centers based out of india as well i sent those in you know in in the uk europe as well as in the central american region.
prospect,so would you say you're primarily a services company?.
rep,we have primarily a services company that is absolutely correct.
rep,so when can we talk about like you know as you said right you know are we a services company.
rep,yes right so i'm referring to slide number 6 right now you know where you see you know the 4 key pillars or 4 key areas of you know our capabilities brillio imagine is our consulting you know framework where we you know sit the customer's do workshops ideate you know on you know on new technologies or strategize with them in building their overall roadmap.
rep,build poc and you know do a lot of impact test impact testing you know and then help them to you know realize these these idea right.
rep,so that is what we do as the imagine framework that is our consulting framework how we engage with our customers  and then you know you talk about experience these days of a business customers engage with organizations in multiple forms right so the experience delivering the experiences you know is very important for organizations so so we have build unique capabilities like immersive technologies in iot etc.
rep,so that's that's the you know that's the capability which is more related to the user experience then it is about you know so the next is that on big data analytics which is you know helping our customers to make high confidence decision making right you know and getting with the customers better using data  transforming the products and services and you optimising there operations using data analytics capabilities so we have unique capabilities accelerators you know models that helps customers to realize the the the value of data quickly and then you know engineering which is the foundation right? you know we have a we have a very strong cloud engineering capabilities you know specifically what we talking about that in todays call and we built  very smart applications you know that all the four pillars we are talking about over here you know culminate to deliver that experience with our customer you know leveraging the smart application and some of those you know platform that we have built you know you can see in the lower bottom right brillio data platform digital platform <> which is our which is  one of our analytica model for internet security.
rep,you know some of those things you know we have which which helps us to take these capabilities to out customers at a faster pace.
rep,any questions john?.
prospect,not so far.
rep,okay sure so i will hand it over to chander after this slide this is basically about alliances and partnerships that we have currently we are a microsoft partner and we'll talk about some of the you know partnership that we have with microsoft in the subsequent slides.
rep,so chander do you want to take it from there from here?.
rep,thanks so john just continue on the point of what rohit was talking about i see we are the the 10 min mark i want to spend about you know 5 minutes kind of giving you a little perspective on our deeper perspective on on what we do in engineering and our relationship with you know what we do with microsoft alright and and then maybe want to ask you know especially around specifics around what you're looking forward to your area is right and and then then we can take conversation further so see i think one one thing you would see the way we have been structured right is we are a  organization but i think what is most important for us is  do we have the the right way of engaging with our customers right.
rep,and to that extent the slide that you see?.
rep,which is around our alliances and partneships  so what we'd have to bring in the best of   you know what each of them do have it right so we don't wanna have everything in house but essentially bring in the right mix of you know the skills that we we have and then essentially be the catalyst in in bringing in the right strenghts of the respective products or vendors that are our there  to help deliver what we have to the customer right the to that extent one very very very strongly engages with the you know the the basically the education community students which is where we are partners with ucla and kellogs primarily around data analytics and arround ai so the ideas to basically bring in the latest on what's happening around you know in the research and how do you basically flying to help solve solve industry problems right? so that's one area where we do it.
rep,second you know we also make these investments into these startups and organizations you know the example that rohit is talking about albdo marketo is something we acquired it was primarily around you know doing the deep analytics solution right so there's a lot of things that you filed along with the same thing in the partnership perspective and then it comes to that you that i was i know i know talk about the engineering dimension site so essentially what you've done is everything around what you do as the nuts and bolts of problem selling exercise right.
rep,whether you use cloud as an intervention methodology which is our expertise lies in  3 areas one is azure second is on aws and third is around open stack.
rep,there are the areas we are deeply focused with with azure and aws where we are kind of tried to the help us both microsoft an amazon.
rep,we are a us national manage partner for microsoft and we do a huge amount of work on azure for microsoft as well.
rep,in fact we've done all the the learning work  you know essentially moving all of the assets of microsoft academy integrating their you know their you know the backend systems. migrating all of this on to azure getting all this on to as you're getting this whole of scale architects for support of a 10 million users worldwide.
rep,these are things that we have done just as  examples right and also with respect to bing analytics ingesting data at about 60 gigs an hour and running this on azure.
rep,a few examples of what we've been doing with microsoft.
rep,it similarly also supporting miscrosoft customer as well which is my slide 8 this few examples of what we have done as a perspective of you know.
rep,again was not sure on what are your specific are you are looking for but we are trying to cover and give you a sense of one the scale and the type of engagement that we do john right.
rep,so the first one that you see is essentially working with this large uk manufacturer. essentially getting entire sap migrated from a heterogeneous <> and into azure.
rep,and in the process actually getting microsoft azure certified for hannah workloads.
rep,which which which we did  successfully two years back.
rep,to give you a perspective right.
rep,it's it's an entirely new area where  probably there's nobody else involved and else trying to basically lead it from the  front of example of us being the catalyst in making it happen alright and in the process basically getting microsoft certified for hanna workloads on azure and production workloads.
rep,and also getting a customer to run on on the new infrastructure altogether.
rep,an example of something that we try to bring.
rep,what we drive and deliver john is around working towards an outcome based model.
rep,so the ideas is really you know understand what the context for the problem that you have and how we can bring in the right technology expertise or the the necessary firepower to make it happen.
rep,so that's our way of engaging and and the solutions that rohit was kind of alluding to our basically our ways off i would say intervention mechanisms to help make these things either repeatable or make it happen faster right so that's our ways of engaging so for us  you know i would say it's more of a problem solving exercise where you you solve the problem the right way and you basically all all different options and then use technology to help you take you towards the goal post right.
rep,and to that goal post  you obviously want to operationalize it by basically building it into multiple ways as a required and an essential taking it there.
rep,ohh and and through this entire process brillio basically drives this model of engaging from ideation to supporting it and then running it.
rep,so examples that you see towards the end like for example we run the microsoft premier support.
rep,right so globally for microsoft  we run walmart's backend support on their databases like we support 11000 servers. so running an example of end to end right from ideation to architecting to actually implementing and then essentially doing you know the support and operations in the managed services for some of the large names is something that we as brillio  basically do it john.
rep,so i will just pause for a second here and i just want to see you know you know i think we are 17 minutes minutes into the conversations.
rep,so just want to hear john your views around what you heard from me so far and i can go deeper into these examples of this from specific areas you would like me to talk about but just want to kind of do a sense of what do you think about what you've heard so far as anything specific that you would like to hear from me.
prospect,no i think the pitch i hear it is you are services company that focuses in targeted newer areas so i don't have any services needs right now but this is something that if we ever step off into some of these areas that we could certainly engage in at a future date.
rep,okay so sure so then you know i think from the way you see.
rep,i think most importantly is around a subsequent slide which is our slide 9 you know we essentially hyped off  this whole you know as an organization right  we formed brillio essentially by breaking out from the parent company and idea was really to kind of see how do we bring in the right expertise to make things happen right? it's not really about see people are one aspect of it but what is more important as you know as an organization how are we connecting with the customer right and how do we deliver great value and this is where you know withing a span of 3 years so essentially see a lot of these awards and mentions that we have been being having and most recently has been with the microsoft inspire conference that we were a couple of weeks back and and then the stevie awards we just receieved.
rep,you know some of the awards around you know cool company great ceo really more importantly microsoft essentially certifying us in terms of managed premier partner.
rep,so basically you know you look at the experiences side of it which is around multi channel experiences or essentially the core engineering work or look at data and analytics.
rep,again i don't say we have expertise we have all the depth about every area but the way we basically  come along as bringing the right expertise to make it happen right.
rep,so that's where you know where we try to do it.
rep,so around the core services john i'm i'm at slide 12 right  essentially it's around engineering which is where for example you know do we design it right do we architect it right having that infra and architecture practice which is what i run.
rep,and then  and then you know having for example like the right ways of optimizing like moving your things  towards a truly serverless design in fact via what we have done is you know for example of both our customers where not just about taking the assets from on premise and moving to cloud but its also about how to optimize and show them year on year benefits around that security and scalability is something that is a fundamental and core in our design so how do you know essentially having resource connecting and driving this you know security by design rather than as an afterthought.
rep,here is core philosphy  the the engineering practice houses and most importantly the third part of it right it's not just about us doing all the cool things around cloud specifically around azure but more importantly how do you help sustain and how do you help you know show value to our customer doing these operations.
rep,i think that those are i would say the core areas that on how we have structured our services and this is how we will be delivering values there are few data points around specific services at cetera but you know so the way how how do you see you know you said that you're looking at all the services and all of these you would probably look at this is the future point in time but specifically around what you been doing in honeywell how how do you see your charter? what what was whats the core areas of the charter you are driving now john? you did mention that you had a cloud team and you are essentially doing work around it.
rep,is there's anything specific that you would like to mention about.
prospect,not really i mean its mostly cloud support so we're on a private cloud on premise for most part we're assisting some of the product teams to publish into the cloud so we got some folks doing that but right now we we've got that pretty well staffed.
prospect,so like i say we don't have any specific needs now i can see if they wander off into wanting to do more ai or data science type things that's an area we don't have.
prospect,so if something like that would come up and they want to move quickly then we might need to go run off and invest in some capabilities there.
rep,okay and on on on the cloud itself i believe you're primarily around azure.
rep,or you been looking at any kind of multi cloud strategy or any of these areas john.
prospect,like i said we're primarily private cloud right now based on the type of work we do but azure  is the the public cloud option we've done a fair amount there.
prospect,there's a good chance will be moving to aws some of our stuff and adding aws in a future but those are the two big ones.
rep,so i was the john rohit here just one question is it like you know when you say you know your are part of you you you have a plan to move to aws as well is that part of the road map and you know have you have you start thinking about  putting a strategy in place for that you know what you would you see like for when i was talking about the imagine thats  exactly one of the services that we provide the way over there as well as we partner with our customers to build that strategy road map. so just wondering right now i have you already started working on the road map and do you see that you know a partner like us can help you to you know in in in building a strategy?.
prospect,we haven't build the strategy there but that's mostly because that direction was more of a corporate conversation.
prospect,they said that they're signing an agreement there so we hadnt plan to go there but if it if that becomes the preference then we'll have to put together a migrations strategy and i move stretching but for now we're assuming that we're we're at is fine and we'll stay there for foreseeable future.
prospect,unless we get in a a fight with microsoft and decide when you do something else but that's typically what drives the things we've made it fairly significant commitment to microsoft so i don't think it's likely that will move away from there it's just it as what those large companies it seems like we're heading with aws now and they've gone in signed that agreement but from my perspective going multi cloud just to say you're multi cloud seems counterproductive it's inefficient and slow.
prospect,azure provides most of what we need today.
prospect,doing it twice in two different locations this seems unwise and not necessary unless were forced into it.
rep,yeah that makes sense you.
rep,so sure so yeah so that's what we had john for today's presentation so we talked like me to give you a quick you know overview about the organisation you know what kind of work we do.
rep,you know we have very strong capabilities as well as very strong partnerships you know in the cloud space  so anyway case you know if there is anything that you're looking you know in future where a partner like us can help you.
rep,we will be more than happy to engage with you and you know and take it forward from there.
prospect,yeah i think the biggest thing if you can email me who you're working with internally already typically the hardest problem with engaging suppliers at honeywell navigating pass procurement so i wouldn't even attempt it until i know how they've gotten around that or if they've you know they've got as an example in the msam what what documents they have what agreements they have.
prospect,if we ever want to use them can we build off of those otherwise i mean you can be looking at three to six months or more engagement period while all that stuff gets put into place and works through legal and all that so i think the to make this before this can go further i'd like to talk to the people that may be already working there and smps and see what types of things they set up and how they've done about it so we can decide whether or not it makes sense that you guys into the list of folks that we talk to you whenever we have a need.
rep,okay beautiful.
prospect,okay well thanks for putting together and give me a kind of an overview i hadn't heard of you prior to this gives me some insight.
rep,no worries john.
rep,thanks very much for your time and i look forward you know just keeping keeping in touch with you and then we'll take it forward if there is any opportunity that arises in the future okay great.
prospect,take care all.
rep,see you take care.
rep,bye.
rep,welcome to zoom enter your participant id po you are in the zoom meeting now there are 1 participants in the meeting well hello jesse.
rep,hai jesse.
rep,this is gautam here from freshdesk.
prospect,good.
prospect,how about you.
rep,i'm doing great jesse.
rep,so i'm a product consultant here and your account manager take through in fact put me up for this demonstration for the day.
rep,alright and you know i did go through some of the requirements that you had so i understand that email lists a current support channel that you use right now.
rep,am i right assuming that.
prospect,um yes or no so we're using multiple different channels right now including a live chat.
rep,um.
prospect,well and sometimes phone calls.
rep,so i understand that you are unhappy thoughts so there you'd have you have all these three channels set up is it.
prospect,yeah well with happy thoughts um with the we did sign up for four actually and the person who handled the customer service before me.
rep,hmm.
prospect,not happy with it like she tells a little bit funky a little bit too difficult to do and like under tried and she's also freed.
prospect,so i found that asked me to kind of find something that my work found freshdesk comforted you know compared to happy that happy boxes no i kind of like what i read and so that's why i chose try to touch the right now.
rep,sure here makes complete sense of it.
rep,so let me take you through the demonstration so at any point during the demonstration jesse if you have any questions you feel free to stop me and we can get that fly fight and then move on. and i'd basically be taking you through you know the way you support channels right now which first one would be the email then of course the live chat and the phone and later on of course we also have a customer support portal that you could have set up with you could go about uploading your fa q's and solution articles so that you end up empowering your customers to handle the queries for themselves so that's an option that you could explore so let me take you through demonstrate these couple of aspects of the help desk system.
rep,and typically by the end of the call i could also share the set of solution articles that you know could help you go about the setup of the system and you know take it out from there.
rep,so let us jump it is a demonstration then jesse and at begin to say my screen now and if you could confirm to me if you're able to view my screen.
prospect,or do one circuit.
prospect,yeah i can.
rep,all right all right so let us start off with you know the lifecycle of an email-based ticket here with freshdesk and let's see how let's do a quick role play but let me shoot out an email assuming that i am one of the customers and let's see from how this is going to look one from a customer's point of view and then of course from an agents point of view too right.
rep,if you could do that and so what are the typical types of query that you generally get there jesse.
prospect,one quick question how long will it take and the second one or can repeat by just ah ah.
rep,how long the session would be.
rep,oh we have the session put up for one hour so that time still with you.
prospect,yeah i guess so.
rep,alright and yeah my question is what are the typical types of queries that you know generally get there so that let me try picking up one of those examples and take you through the life cycle of that.
prospect,oh but i guess some point it so we sell cheap and some are so we saw organic teas right but then ours is a little different from what's out there because it's a press together and i believe there's no such other thing as fresh tea.
prospect,i'm a lot of people sometimes that is an organic which they are is it you know like how is it made by walking on what's caffeine level and stuff like that.
rep,sure you know let's let's say say that someone's try to get to you asking what are the components of your you know the ingredients that you use in making the tea powder there right so.
rep,i do assume that you you have a support email set up to which your customers right into.
prospect,yeah we have an email forwarding are more we have an email provider that we do on.
prospect,you know and do discussion.
rep,sure and with freshdesk it's as simple as you know you set up the forwarding rule in that support mailbox and all is once you do that all the emails that come in there would be converted into tickets and when they come into your help desk system.
rep,so similarly i do have one such support email setup and which i'd be using to take you through the demonstration so let's say that you know i'm one of the customers so try to reach out to you try to understand the components of the tea.
rep,so let's say he says hai and crested and purchasing your product please let me know about it right so.
rep,there specifically is you know the email which a customer sent out for them it's going to be seamless where they'd still be shooting you out an email and coming back now from an agents perspective is going on its stab that you see here is where you know they'd be getting all these emails or the queries that are coming to the system and so here it could be see um i'm sorry.
prospect,oh no ouch hardly it feels.
rep,right so it's going to be on top of the queue wait to see if you see happens to be the subject of that email and it's the requester of that email and of course that comes along with the timestamp of when the specific email was set up right.
rep,up front by default when it comes with it comes with the status as open with the priority set to low and no agent is assigned against that specific ticket right.
prospect,ya i know.
rep,now as an agent what you can do is if you think this is a ticket that you can pick up you could come and open that ticket and let's see what are the actions that you could perform as an agent in the system.
rep,first one would be a simple straightforward reply so you could directly way back to the customer and fact while replying you could also make use of these can responses which is nothing but certain set of pre-configured reply templates that you could have it configured in this system so that you can you know plug plug in them as responses we're never or ticket you know related to that comes by.
prospect,ya.
rep,so you have your customers asking about the components of the tea you could have that as a pre-configured response template you have it set up so that you know you can plug in that response tip immediately right.
rep,so you could go about and what let's say that you know you respond back to the customer by hitting the send button and once you do that from an again from an agents perspective it's going to be part of the ticket rate that you see here where as soon as i send out what i would typically do is in order to better track this ticket and come and change the status to let's say something like you know awaiting on customers response so i know that all of the customers code and i could wait or i need not have to open this ticket unless and until you know someone gets back to me on that right.
rep,so basically do that.
rep,and i would assign myself as an agent to those case on to one who you know took responsibility of sending out the reply and i would update this sets of properties so these properties that you see here are something out of the box but i'm not close you can also have your own set of custom fields set up so that you know you could maybe for later on our purposes or maybe pulling reports or you know filtering out these tickets in fact you could go about using them too.
prospect,ah okey.
rep,so i would say let's say that you could have certain more options apart from this so i'd say that this is basically sales query and later maybe if i'm looking to pull out water how many sales query i got with for this month that's a report that i'd be easily able to pull up later right.
rep,coming back to the ticket itself so this would be you know how it would look for an agent now coming back from a customer's perspective it would be an extension or no part of the same email thread that they initially initiated right so.
rep,this was the email would stay short out as a customer and this the rajion sent out as an agent in this system.
prospect,yes all right.
rep,so that's how you get you know typically reply back but there could be some scenarios here where you might need to collaborate with some of your other enabling teams in your system so maybe if and someone is trying to track the order you might need to reach out your delivery team or to your finance team to know what's the status of certain things right so and they might not be added as agents in the system so in that case what phrixus providers you only you have the option to directly forward this complete email thread to that specific person to their mailbox.
prospect,okey.
rep,and one holds back right that gets added as something private note in the system so.
rep,this private note some note that would be visible just to the agents in the system and not to the end requester of that specific ticket right.
rep,so this way you will be able to collaborate with your other enabling teams to who are not added as agents in the system and of course with the ones who are added as agents in the system you could directly add a private notes it could be instances where you know you might need to pick their brain on any issue that's coming so you could say something like hi you know would like your thoughts on this and you could notify that agent and once you do that and add this private notes it becomes part of the same ticket set and also that agent would be notified letting them know that you know one other agent is looking to you know  get get your thoughts on this.
rep,so please look into it.
prospect,oh okey.
rep,all right so that's typically how you could go about the shooter and in case you could be scenarios if you have multiple agents in the system and i understand that you are looking to have something between three to five you also have this option to add the other agents as what the those tickets so what this basically does is you know they could be scenarios where one agent has assigned himself to this ticket but it may be some other agent to who would like to know what's happening with respect to this ticket or with what's happening or what are the various actions that are taking place with respect to this ticket so in that suit scenarios they can come and add themselves as let's say watch us to this ticket and once we do that all the actions that are taking place with like to this specific ticket even they would be notified on that.
rep,so that's about one option that we have which is called as the watcher.
rep,then of course let me just we have one other benefit of you know using this help desk system let me just quickly pick the right ticket to show you the example of that yes.
rep,so here if you see we also have this option that these recent tickets so the okey it is nothing but it gives the agent a complete history of the various conversation that has this system has had with that specific customer so that you know he gets it gets a much more relevant idea into the current query thats come in so that he can send out more of an apt response going out right.
rep,it are the click of button he had the complete history of conversations too.
rep,so typically about you know the email of a life cycle of an email based ticket that's into the ticket speed but coming back to this page here was also possible as when you have multiple use in the system what they could do is they can come here and set up views for themselves so at you can have your own set of custom filters too so i can say that you know my default view i would like to have it as all the tickets that have been assigned to me after along the status let's say which are either open or pending so exactly what i could do is come here save this view and let's say i'd say them as these are welcome tickets so that i know that you know this becomes my default view in the system so when you have multiple such agents they can have their own sets of you so that they need not have to every time come and fill in these filters to filter out the tickets that they are responsible for they can have their own set of views too.
prospect,yeah quick search.
rep,all right so get that's pretty much about how you can set up your set of custom views and of course with the status that you see here so as soon as maybe a customer response back you would have a you know the label coming here telling that you know the customer has responded so in that way something like this so in that way you know that with other tickets that you know you would have to take it up first before you know moving on the others so you have these notifications that keeps coming in too.
prospect,yeah okay that's good.
prospect,um okay also another quick question how do i go about setting this up like obviously the email going into this and you know phone numbers and all that stuff.
rep,mm-hmm.
rep,sure sure it's actually very simple straightforward set up there the same fact because with the email of course what are you gonna do is all you have to do is set up a new support email right.
rep,where you can type in your email address and accordingly you'd have a long address coming up getting populated something similar to this.
prospect,aah okey.
rep,right this copy-paste this long address and added to the forwarding rule so.
rep,which is the current system that you use there jessie for your email.
prospect,we use a banner with gmail.
rep,well all right so if it's gmail it's a very simple set up in fact you have your settings here and under the settings there of this forward or pio pri map option coming here so this way i'm gonna add the forwarding address and it's a two-way verification that happens and once that is done you know all the tickets all the emails that come into your physical mailbox would be converted into tickets automatically.
prospect,okay that's cool okay and then okay and then everything else like phone number and then the live chat same thing.
rep,um sure next i'll take you through that so this is with the email setup then with the live chat in fact it's even more simpler where you already do have the widget code available so all you got to do is copy paste this code on before the body tag of the web page that you're looking to you know have this chat code embedded and once you do that it's up and running again.
rep,all right  right so it would look something typical to this so if this happens to be your website where you have a copy pasted my vertical chat widget code there so it could either be a preset form that you could have it set up and based on the option that you choose you can even have it routed to the specific agents in the system or you can also have go active chat where based on a certain set frequency of time which your customer spends on that specific page of your website you can have these pop up by themselves these live chat widget.
prospect,okay okey.
rep,right below it's really over here let me take demonstrate how this live chat would work so let's say i'm trying to reach out from a customer's point of view all they got to do is if you're having a free chat home base set up here they would initiate the chat and now from an agent's perspective that would you know give them a notification on the bottom you know.
prospect,if they.
rep,see here so here if you see you agent will also have information on the location from which that specific person is chatting and also know the web page on from which he has initiated the chat so for example if you have this live chat with it on all the web pages of your website maybe if they are chatting from the pricing site you know web page the agent would know that maybe this more of a sales related query or maybe they are maybe on the features page or you know your ingredients page you know that it's more of a technical question that's going to be coming in so that gives it more of a relevancy to why your customer is trying to initiate the chat with you and of course that in fact is going to be again seamless where you type them and you know you could go about this chat right and at the end of the chat to the system brings about a pop-up that asks you would you would like to convert the stat into a ticket so they could be not you know in your instances where you chatted with that person but maybe you would have to follow up with them later over an email right.
prospect,yeah yeah.
rep,so all you got do is let's just say save it as a new ticket capture the person's email address and save it and now you would again have this on top of your cue on your tickets page  we want that information available.
rep,and what you can also do is since you also use multiple you know channels for your support you could also set your filters based on the source of that specific ticket so now if i say just to chat i can have you know tickets pop-up right.
rep,so typically now i could end up opening that where i'd have the complete status to hear and reply back to the customer in case you're looking to you know follow up on email.
prospect,oh  okayokay that's cool um okay and can you show me the positive phone.
rep,sure so with the phone of course that in fact works similar to the chat setup.
rep,where if you you do already have a number available there to which your customers reach out here to.
rep,do you already have a you know an 800 number or phone number with your customers reach out to you to are you looking to purchase a number for you.
prospect,i believe we have a phone number.
rep,aha so if that is the case we also do have the option to put that number with your system so all you got to do is raise a request to our support team and they'd get it done for you.
prospect,perfect.
rep,once that is done in fact it is a very simple setup with respect to the phone where you're either have a simple message where which could be a welcome message that you could upload or in fact event record on the system itself or it could also be a key press based ivr option which is based on certain sets of key bridge with your customers made you could have these calls diverted to either an agent in the system or it could be a group of agents in the system or for that matter even connect to a different number that you like to ring.
prospect,all right and how will you spot you're having a phone conversation how does that get converted into did i get converted into a ticket or power to pick a turn-off.
rep,sure it definitely that let me just quickly and i'll show you that too.
rep,say that you know i'm on the spawn channel and let me try ringing in this number from an alternate help desk system so you once you have the phone of course you also have the option to make outbound calls from your system is this and now let's say i'm calling into this number and so during the course of the call to the agent has the option to you know add notes or take down notes with respect to that specific call  and all like with respect to the chat at the end of the call the system would pull up a pop up asking if you'd like to convert this into a ticket so once you say yes or all that all it does is you know it comes again on top of the cue and you know how they call recording embedded against that specific ticket too so that you know coming into it they can definitely go ahead and do that.
prospect,okay okay that's separate for.
prospect,yeah one last question would be mobile you guys work of like a mobile app for some purpose here.
rep,sure we do have a freshdesk standalone mobile app which is supported both on ios as well as android.
prospect,okay and it's just also robust as just you know desktop or is it so limited.
rep,it definitely does have all the basic features or all the actions that you would like to take as an agent but then they there will be some features which might not be available on the mobile option but on the phone but on the desktop but that is something very minimal.
prospect,certain you know for me some of the stuff are limited.
rep,something like you know inserting scanned responses or you know a certain things like that so those who are the extra ones that you wouldn't be able to do but then if you're looking to maybe update the ticket properties or reply back to the customer forward that ticket all that is definitely possible and of course you you also have this option with the phone channel to accept the calls via imobi in case you're off the cubes or on the field and not available to take calls on the browser you could definitely go ahead and do that too.
prospect,do that do i have to do this selection every time i'm switching or the arm ugly penalty more it wouldn't.
rep,you would have to be manually switching it to wire phone in case you're looking to take calls on your handset.
prospect,okay and then if i downloads the app tonight probably our third we have a browser or the app right.
prospect,yeah. yes okay oh and as on the app i be able to you know let's say now i get a phone call or a live chat would i be able to convert the ticket also while doing on the app or what it was done this also.
rep,um actually jessie with respect to that um i think i need a little bit more clarity is it alright if i maybe get you back or an email over that if it's at an option that's available on the mobile app to.
prospect,yeah i'll just email me back and i'll be brave.
rep,sure i find i know it should be possible but let me confirm to you that or an email.
prospect,yeah i just wanna you know at least the basics i'm actually i work a lot off my phone special i don't know wrong you know i want to be able to for.
rep,sure no problem let me you know get you that piece of information because typically what i do is like i said post this call i can also subs send you certain solution articles summarizing on these couple of things that we discussed today so that you know you can refer to them to go up with the set up and alternatively what we could also do is something maybe when you had when you think you've had enough time to play around with the system we can you can also go out and shoot us an email where we can maybe go ahead and schedule a setup call which could be maybe again for an odd time where i we can discuss your specific workflows and i can you know help you set up your system and have it up and running in no time.
prospect,yeah that'd be great um yeah just go ahead and for or you know figured that question out for me and i guess send me some more solutions.
prospect,i'll try this out for a while and then you know we'll go from there.
prospect,i don't know um because i'm gonna set up today um but you know it's gonna take time to try to figure it out here all shit generally all the stuff seemed pretty good and it seemed a very you know intuitive very easy um but it would take time to figure out you know there are there more you know problems are there in certain aspects that way to happen and in a way i don't know that when all comers i don't know often how long that would take for me here pick.
rep,sure not a  problem jessee you know you have any questions with respect to the product you could directly shoot out an email to me because i'd be a technical point of contact and i'd be more than glad to help you at any given point of time.
prospect,thank you so much.
rep,no problem jessy is really nice i talking to you so before that.
rep,do you have any questions for me at this point.
prospect,uh no um just you know if i think of you know after trying some stern things i'll probably um you know email you and that way if i have any problems or questions.
rep,yeah definitely definitely.
rep,look look over hearing from you then soon. great thanks so much.
rep,right thank you so much for your time and have a great day.
prospect,you too bye.
rep,welcome to zoo.
rep,enter your participant id but.
rep,you are in the zoom meeting now .
rep,they're going in yet at brock.
prospect,you're all on bill.
prospect,oh.
prospect,that's weird.
prospect,hi brock on my own through login i don't know what happened.
prospect,neither.
prospect,okay we're just waiting on wade.
prospect,out here okay are you talking to someone specific amanda is that just talking yourself.
prospect,i'm talking to myself should i say that out loud [laughter].
prospect,okay wade are you on.
prospect,yep i'm on.
prospect,okay all right and i think we're all here so i'm just going to kind of just get the conversation going so today we're going to take a look at freshdesk i'm really a miniature of this a whole demo presentation but as i've mentioned before you guys are the experts so i'll let you guys shoot away with questions and once you go ahead.
rep,okay so guys oh this is balaji here from freshdesk so i so i had a conversation with a my dear amanda earlier last week so she gave me the requirements and she also mentioned that the company that you guys recently acquired is using freshdesk and you want to see the full capacity of how you can utilize freshdesk - so i have gautham with media from my team he is the product consultant so he'll be sharing his screen and giving you guys a product work through to give you a better understanding about how freshdesk can add more value to your current support process and feel free to stop if you have any questions at any point of time gautham will be glad to answer those questions.
rep,all right hi guys this is gotham here how you guys doing today.
prospect,good how u done.
rep,i'm doing great thank you so much for asking guys first of all i really appreciate you spending some time off for this demonstration right and you know like balaji said during the course of the demonstration if you guys got any questions you feel free to stop me we can't get that clarified and then move on right and naturally i'd also have some questions for you you know try by understanding your your world to a better so that you know i'm able to suggest you the right solution to see if prosthetic is a good fit for you guys going forward right and typically at the end of the demonstration i'll also shoot out an email so if you have any further clarifications you get you know direct directed to me i'd be a technical point of contact.
rep,all right but that's it and i just have a conversation with your manager balaji where he let me know about his earlier conversation with amanda where i understand it currently you guys use email and phone as you know the primary support channels and i also understand that you're the bridge between the distributors and your customers is that right in the a function of that case.
prospect,thats correct.
rep,all right so when exactly do you see the help desk system you know being used here or you know into the workflow that you have that.
prospect,i've this is brock i've never seen the product you mentioned that we did acquire a company that leverages it i've never seen the product we've recently changed our go-to-market strategy and it resulted in a more team as opposed to individually named accounts.
prospect,i have some what i'm looking for is just to see how maybe we could improve communication between teams and we're using shared inboxes and i know we've had some struggles and with that although i think your product might be more specifically geared toward service tickets and trouble tickets but i don't know so i'm just i just understand belong for the ride maybe wade might have a better.
prospect,yeah got a this is mr wade you know and a couple things i guess one we met freshdesk from a service delivery perspective we know we can be much better in terms of how we executed that so we're interested in understanding that so we could just walk us through the basic service delivery context of how you the platform to be used there effectively and different capabilities that you typically advertise no no that look enhance crm capabilities that could be added into the mix in the platform which would also be helpful in the transition of you know quotes that we developed in in other tools but certainly once it's integrated into freshdesk we can have more of an end end workflow not only accepting and processing that you know well basically defining the opportunities and then accepting and processing those as orders all the way through to customer service on the backend pre-implementation and then you know after you know post deployment.
rep,right sure so are you guys also interested in maybe a crm product right which you were referring to so we do have a sister product of these pressfield's which is a completely a high-velocity crm product and help the first step which is more from a help desk perspective is what it is so we do have a tight integration between the two so let me take you through freshdesk which is more from a helpdesk solution point of view and then if you guys interested we could also you know set up a meeting for freshdesk sales which is more from a customer centric way to the crm based product right.
prospect,i think i'm you have been you just touched on if if that's possible today just you know something proof is on in just a quick overview of fresh sales would be very interesting and helpful.
rep,sure let me see what we can do about that we put on sherrod yeah this is balaji huh so that is possible once this freshness demos or i will be looking in surya from our fresh sales team so he would be able to throw some light upon sales and give you a quick overview of the product.
rep,alright guys so without any further delay i think we can jump into this demonstration where and take you through the freshdesk as a product which is to help that solution so i just begin to share my screen here and if you get in confirmed to me you're able to view my screen quickly jump right.
rep,okay thank you all right so.
rep,what the help desk system the first thing you know we look at the backend set of things which is for agents or for your internal team collaborations what are the various ways and the channels through which you know you could go about doing this communication so currently i understand that you guys use outlook there for your email transactions taking place so what you could do is with freshdesk can have a common support email set up you know the email too with either your customers or your vendors right into and that could be a common mailbox that you could use that you could forward these emails coming into the system in the form of tickets so that you have all the email transactions and all the communications on a single platform and all the agents were added you know we're accessing help desk will have complete access and a transparency to you know all the emails that have come in the form of tickets and of course the tracking and the responsibility also increases once it you know when you have it in a single view here so that's it let me do a quick demonstration and show you what a lifecycle of an email based ticket here with freshdesk like right.
rep,so for that let let us assume a quick role play here will let me assume to be one of your customers who try to reach out to you right so to them it's going to be seamless where they're going to continue reaching out to you to a certain before that so.
rep,do you guys also do have a support email set up there you know to which your customers right into.
prospect,yes we do its support at clear to their. savanah
prospect,there's one that's order entry at clear to their comm.
rep,all right so yeah so similarly you can have those support emails set up with fresh steps so that all the emails that come into that mailbox gets converted in the form of ticket so yeah well similarly i do have a support email set up and what are the typical types of queries that you get there guys so that's like you know i can pick up an example of that and try seeing how to collaborate with the various teams that you have there.
prospect,savannah what do you typically just an order has been processed and is ready for you to enter correct.
prospect,sorry there's an echo or like a lot of feedback that i'm getting so i can't if like way you're really accurate to i don't know if you're on speaker phone or what but could you please repeat the request.
rep,oh wait i think i did get the digits of it so maybe order tracking over there.
prospect,correct that's right.
rep,oh all right sure so let us say that you know by one if a customer is trying to reach out trying to understand the status of their order so let's say so you know typically it's a i trying to reach you guys alright so if this is you know typically the query that your customers is reach out to you for for them it's going to be seeing this way they'll still be sending out the email to your support address so now let us look at how this emails going to come in to your system the form of ticket and how you could collaborate amongst your various teams there and you know to have better responsibility and tracking of these emails but coming right so for an agent where he'd be looking at these emails on the tickets tab that you see here so this is going to list down the various email set up come in to your support mailboxes and with that said i you know i understand that sarah was also mentioning you have to support emails so we also have the capability of adding as as many support emails as you can and and and you know assign them to the respect to groups in the system so that you know the rest of the team doesn't get bothered by the emails coming into something like support and maybe a second email than sales at your company dot com right so in that way you could have multiple such mailboxes set up so now let us look at the current email that we sent right now so here if you see it is if you can see this on the top of the list over here where this happens to be the subject of that email it comes along with who is the requester of the email and of course the time stamp of when that specific email was sent out right so now as an agent what you can do is you go into the ticket and let's see what are the various ways you know what are the various actions that you could go about using as an agent in the system so that.
prospect,she doesn't real quick before you get into all the action so what your point was like if we had different sales groups we could even create different subgroups.
prospect,members.
rep,exactly perfect on that so in fact just to demonstrate that it could be something similar to this where you could have multiple sides mail boxes set up so something says one as support and it could be you know multiple such mail boxes over here.
rep,right and in that case you could also have your groups set up in your system so that what i was like i was saying each of these emails coming into these respective mailboxes could be directed to specific groups and it's only the agents who have been added to these groups would be notified on them so that you could still keep it up you know you get categorize them into two separate groups and so keep it different from each other right.
prospect,all right so yeah now any other questions there.
prospect,and really it's just a matter of pointing that email at at freshdesk or what we had those already predetermined and we wanted to integrate them into say another business operation within our freshdesk account what's the process of getting those emails directed through freshdesk is it pointing mx records or.
rep,all right so thats as simple as that just setting up a forwarding rule there.
rep,right so once you have the founding rule you just followed all the emails that come in to those respective mailboxes and your friends gets tickets what's that.
rep,yeah sure so any other questions before i move on to then.
rep,perfect let's do that - so now as you know agents of the system there are a couple of ways in which you could respond one is where you get directly hit the reply button and send forth your reply so you see that you say it is fine reach out to you and i can say sure you know suggest a date and time right and you could go about sending this response and once you send this response it's going to go back to that person who requested for this and for an agent it's going to be part of the same ticket thread that you see here so what i would do for better tracking purposes is i would as soon as i send out i send out send out this response that come at change the stages to say something like you know awaiting on customers response right so that i'd dont know that you know the balls of the customers code and i can't wait for the response from them before i maybe looked into this ticket again right and since i answered this at also assign myself as an agent to this ticket so that you know that gives me that says me as the person responsible for this current query that's coming right so these are a couple of things from an agents side so now coming back from a customer's point of view this is going to come back to them in the form of that same email thread that you sent out so from a customer centric view it's going to be seamless to him where it is still going to be an email transaction happening and from agents perspective you have the pop-up ticket here right so this is a simple straightforward way in which you could reply to a ticket and of course when you're applying you also have options to make use of scanned responses which is nothing but certain sets of pre-configured email templates that you could have it set up in your system and when query related to that comes in you know you plug it back and when it comes back right so that you could make use of these scanned responses and so that's about how you know the ways in which you can yes.
rep,so gotham the key then is once you start a thread going through here is to continue responding out of this thread in freshdesk so you keep it all tracked correct.
rep,exactly so why do you have yeah.
prospect,i got a quick question for you gotham on so let's say that so that customer that sent in that inquiry someone else on his team also sent in a very similar inquiry about the same pio or whatever i wanted to assign that ticket number that was created to and to another event so it can merge all those together so we can keep the communication consistent does that inquiry make sense to you.
rep,yep that makes complete sense there's because you know this is the exact way in which you know that we have this option to merge tickets so it could be where it could be the same customer who sent out me me two different threads so now instead of maintaining it as two threads what you could do is you could choose them and merge that specific ticket right you can merge it based on the requesters name or based on the ticket id that you have right so once you do that you have them merge and it's only going to be a single you know channel of communication that goes out which will definitely reduce on the redundancy then.
prospect,okay yeah thank you.
rep,alright perfect cool so yeah so like i was saying we saw hope you could go about replying so now more importantly in terms of you know internally collaborating amongst it could be between various agents of the system or it could also be between maybe some of the other enabling teams in the system so let us look at that so now when let's say someone's trying to find out the status of the order there could be instances where you know you might need to communicate with some of your other enabling teams that you have there in your organization right so it could be maybe you'd have to reach out to the finance team or maybe the hr team and so forth right and it does not needed it that all those of you know users in your organization would have been added as agents in the system right so in order to collaborate with other users in your organization who are not added as agents in the system so that is where you have this option to forward this complete emails ticket said to that person right so in for example you get forward this to your someone from the finance team where they are going to receive the complete history of the sternal patient coming in to their mailbox and once they respond back to that that's going to come and get added as something known as a private note in the system right so subscribe it note is nothing but a node that gets added which will be visible just to the agents in the system and not to the end customer request requested for that specific query right so in this way you'll be able to collaborate with your other enabling teams to who might not be added as agents in the system by forwarding this completely get read to them and once they respond like i said it's going to come here and get added as a private note right.
rep,and similarly in there could be cases where you know a certain ticket has come in and you know let's say gotham has been assigned us an agent to this but there could be instances where you know you might also maybe would like to know what another amanda thinks about this specific query in that way what you could do two ways you could directly add a private note saying something like hi you know your thoughts on this and let's say i look here and add amanda as an agent and add this private note so a notification now would be going into amanda letting them know that you know one other agent is trying to you know collaborate with you on this so take a look at into this query that's coming right so in this way you could collaborate both with your internal teams who are added at agents to your helpdesk system as well as with people who are you know other uses of the in your organization too.
prospect,gotham can you assign so in the event of a maybe of shift work or teams could you assign multiple agents to a single ticket.
rep,um no that not possible there where you will not be able to add multiple agents to a single ticket but then what is actually possible is we have certain other ways to collaborate which is called as you know a parent child ticketing so it could be a certain task that's coming to the system and in case you think that you know this is this is a task that can be split into  put into two where it could be two different agents looking at it so that is something that is possible right so let me take the right ticket so that i could explain that to you just give me a moment here guys.
rep,all right so in that that case so here if you see you will be able to add only one agent against the ticket but then like i said what's possible is you can add a child ticket to this existing ticket where you split this task amongst to be two you know two agents in the system right in that way you will be able to you know have assigned two agents against the same ticket.
rep,does that make sense.
rep,so you have the same thread here where you come here choose a different agent against it and save it so that this kids you know saved as a child to the parent ticket so that you could have two agents assigned against it and collaborating on the same issue so that's when.
rep,they learn of it yeah.
prospect,i'm sorry goutham what another solution to that be to just have the group and just have the individuals responsible for that ticket as a group and then not have an agent assigned at all and then whoever is responsible for it would just be able to see changes within that group.
rep,sure that's that's something that's definitely possible so what i was talking about this more from where you know you assign an agent to per single ticket and once you do that that person's becomes responsible to that and it's only him who is only one person who you can assign it but like you said you can definitely have this ticket coming into a group of agents and so that all of the agents in that specific group can be notified on that and who are things is something relevant to them they can pick up that ticket for themselves and once they do that they get added as agent against that so yep you could definitely have a certain ticket coming to a group of agents where all of them would be notified on that that's an.
prospect,if u go back in i don't i don't have a place a button that says add child in any of my tickets how do i get there again.
rep,um that is in fact one of the integrations that we have so in order to get that set up you can go to apps and here you have this option that says you know adding a parent child ticketing so it's a simple one-click installation and once you have that you would get that button to add child tickets.
prospect,okay thank you.
rep,all right no problem so yeah coming back to that in so in that way you will be able to assign only one agent against a ticket but in case of collaboration you can make child tickets and you don't have have two agents working parallely on that but an alternate solution one i could also suggest is maybe there could be scenario well i think the initial one was with your you're talking with regard to a shift change right.
prospect,what was the question.
rep,alice i was writing very you know well for the purpose to act to agents was it more from you know the point of view where it could be one agent who's looking after it but maybe he should go up gets completed and it's someone else coming in and who's looking to work on the same ticket.
prospect,that was very good listening gotham i didn't it i did mention shift work but i was more thinking like vacation at that individual that it's assigned to if i could put someone else on it or or if it was a team that's actually responsible if i could put multiple entities.
rep,all right yeah sure so in that date will it work also suggest you guys is you can add the second agent as a watcher to that so that you know even they get notified on the various actions that are taking place with respect to this ticket so if you know that someone from your team is is not going to be you know present coming in is enters that is the time you know when your customer reaches out to you since you added them as water even they be notified on the various notifications that comments so they can come here teams and add themselves as the agent and you don't go about responding to that.
rep,so you think that that is a work flow that good fit for the scenario that you have.
prospect,i think that is that's possible.
rep,so in the key.
prospect,i think gotham is that you know we operate in a team-based function here so whether like routes example if somebody goes on vacation or or maybe just they're working you're collaborating on a ticket the need for visibility primarily so you nobody on that team and potentially even other teams can get to it and then also you know if somebody does happen that you have on vacation or goes to training or something that other team members can step in and see everything.
rep,here so in it perfect so in that way what i would strongly suggest to you guys is to go about creating radius groups from the system and add these agents against these specific groups so that you know if you have these tickets coming in you could also be you can view them based on the groups that you have so on the team so that you know if maybe someone from let's say your sales team would like to view what's happening with the technical support you can have these various view set up so that they could toggle between these videos views and see which are these tickets that have come in to those respective groups.
prospect,yeah i think that's exactly how it reply.
rep,great so that's great you know simple and straightforward to because once you have the group set up all you gotta do is click on save as and you know select a view of give it a certain unique and make it available for you know either agents specific to the group or for all agents so that you know you can collaborate amongst the various groups that you have then.
rep,all right no problem so yeah that that in that way you could definitely go about you know satisfying that workflow that you have guys all right so that's mostly about you know an email based ticket that's coming to the system so any other questions guys so far with this because next we could move to phone support channel.
prospect,i think good i think i'm okay with the email portion that's were.
prospect,yeah i think i think starting i think really just a matter of identifying the groups and then the rule based on those groups and cleaning that up cleaning that up a little bit as you can see when you logged into ours it's kind of nasty because i think what happened traditionally before we got before we required and it ended business the the team members would use it more as a collection point no rate is in it it was not he was not using you know the email chain then went directly out of their email account and outlook or wherever but not necessarily inside clear i did cite fresh time brain.
rep,right right i understand.
rep,shit not a problem guys what we could also do is maybe you could take some time to play around with the system and if you think you're comfortable we could also have have a set up called schedule where you know we can discuss your specific workflows and i can help you set up your system in the right way so that you know you can get it up and running in no time.
prospect,yeah that will be great.
rep,yeah definitely so like i said after this call you know that shoot out an email so in case you guys would like to schedule set up a call you could definitely go ahead and do that at any point too all right so coming back to this before that so that's that would be email channel no more questions.
prospect,i think we're good.
rep,alright guys thank you.
prospect,danna you're good with it.
prospect,i am.
rep,all right so next is of course the phone and so i do understand that currently you do have an 800 number to which your customers call in to.
rep,all right so some of what you can do is you can have that number ported on to freshdesk itself so that you know everything you have your customers calling about that number you have that ringing here with freshdesk to where it is even here once you put that number with this it's a simple setup that you could have either it could be a simple message where you could call out upload the welcome message or record it or even convert the text to speech right and that would play to all groups in the system but then when you have various groups what i would actually suggest is have an ivr base set up way based on the key press you can direct these calls coming in to specific groups in the system or input also be specific agents in these groups right so once you have this set up it's going to be as simple as wait you know you accept the calls either wire the browser but in case they could be cases where you know if some of your agents are on the field it could definitely also say they would like to receive it by a phone in that way all the calls would be directed to their handsets all right so there are the two ways in which you could receive these calls and with respect to the call itself you can yeah you know you have the feasibility to record these calls you get you know set up the maximum together and of course if there are there is a situation where in case none of the none of them are available to take these calls you could have it you know directed to a voicemail and that would automatically convert into a ticket.
prospect,that is a different license or is that part of the base package then.
rep,it is definitely part of the about the base package there so even with the porting of the number all you got to do is give us your number and i getting processed from the back end here where we can have that integrated with freshdesk.
prospect,okay then once we ported it we're free to like if we decided you run that through a different contact center or something like that we could also port it back then right.
rep,exactly yep so you're just going to use the helpdesk system to receive those calls where it's only going to get diverted into the helpdesk system and your your telephony network smooth will be the zip.
rep,all right and of course even with this you have the you know the access to select the specific group that you like to ring that out to right so that is the rest of the agents and the other groups wouldn't get to stove when a certain call comes in so yeah that's how powerful you could go about setting up you know phone channels with freshdesk so let me just quickly demonstrate a small example of how this calls come in and let us look at one other benefit of having are integrating the phone with your helpdesk test system so just give me a moment gage before i just set that up helpdesk.
rep,so typically you could also make outbound calls from your helpdesk system itself so when you make a call you know you have a pop up coming where the agent could add notes during the course of the call itself and let's say at the end of the call when he cuts it the system in fact pulls out the pop up and ask if you would like to convert this call into a ticket right so they could be instances where you might later need to follow up with that same person maybe through an email or certain other things like that so in that case what you could do it you could capture the name or if of course even the email address of that person and save it in the form of a ticket so that that's going to come here on top of the queue again and you could you know you can even have the call recording embedded against that specific ticket and you know you go about maybe later on following up maybe through an email with the same person right.
rep,so do you see you guys see yourself using this workflow at any point do you think this is something that is relevant to you.
prospect,um possibly we also have loud contact solutions here that you know we may be looking at as well we actually market to our customers so um we could i'm assuming link that into this as well you know that's part of what we're looking at it that you know from a support standpoint we're like press test is because it's you know highly integrated into our operational model right now.
rep,all right all right okay.
prospect,from a crm standpoint mom if we can integrate those two together and that has a lot of benefits.
rep,sure so we fight with the crm you know since we touched upon that point with the first sales in fact it would look something difficult to do this because okay not with this specific requester let me try it you're not pulling out more of a relevant ticket here because it's basically going to you know compare the two customers that you have at both the ends and based on that of this data because with the present integration in fact it's going to look from the typical to this case when you pull out a ticket and you click on that that's going to give you the complete account details of that person along with the details and of course also to do with the contact details of stay rainy right.
rep,so i'm sure you know surya my colleague would be giving you much more perspective into how the integration and of course what they would press sales but both freshdesk and sales integration so specifically how that would look like.
rep,right all right cool so just just wanted to let that know you know since we touched upon the crm integration there alright so going back to the phone channel.
rep,guys any questions with this so far kids after this it's one final customer support portal that we can look at before you know i take more questions and handle the calls to surya.
prospect,like i said you know we haven't integrated or call side of the crm.
prospect,you know from a support number standpoint that could be something we could definitely take advantage of and the clear to their side yeah we have to do some evaluation i think in terms of while we were going to do that from the distribution team sales and kevin operations so and but it's sorting it you know see how seamless it is it's very nice and be very easy to track calls and instead of having right now our teams have to do redundant entry in to  crm and in other systems so that's what's nice about this it automatically tracks it.
rep,sure thank you so much for sharing that you know that gives more much more perspective into how we could go about the setup code to 4x all right okay and of course the last thing that you know i'd like to talk to you about is amanda mentioned that you guys might also be interested in having a customer support portal to listen right so let me just quickly explain um you know how that would work so yeah a moment here guys so pure on your website in fact i did not see that you do already have a support tab so what what is typically the support that we get talking about you just to differentiate this from the customer sub good guys.
prospect,this one's actually through our our other side of our business which right now is it linked to in terms of what we're talking about today so we have different business units one is direct and that i have the support screen here that you pulled up there the other businesses one is our direct our distribution operating right.
prospect,for a north american network of about eight to nine hundred different dealers that we have one is a boutique or contributor the other business that's actually up and running in freshdesk is called clear to there that's a site that we run we sell and we mark and sell iot and security and surveillance solutions project the us and in canada as well so that i wanna actually utilize the freshdesk today from a supplying perspective.
prospect,what you see here though at some point we'd like to link that in as well in the past so i think imagine you know if you wanted to take what you see here and link that into fresh that's going to explain how we do that definitely that's.
rep,exactly what i was getting at to it so typically what you can do is since you know that originated already do have a support portal what he can do is have that link over here where once your customers click on let's say something like contact support that would redirect them to a boat route that would look something similar to this where they can you can have your faqs your solution articles and you could increase the number of touch points for your customers to reach out to you to using this customer support portal and that's typically how you could link your website with the portal and coming to the portal in fact you can in fact make it look like okay extension of your website itself so that you know even would be seamless event for your customers when they move maybe from your website to the customer support portal that you guys offer right so that they wouldn't feel like you know they moved on to a third party page at the end of the day there so that's typically how you could go about linking where with the set up it is pretty simple case or the boodles you you use the url that you have and it's based on the url that you provide here is where you know that's going to be linking back just give me a moment before i open that screen so yeah you know provide a portal url and it is based on the click with your customers make on your website from which you can direct them on to the sports right.
rep,sure and so a couple of benefits of having to help their system is here is where they could come in and let's say you know type in certain keywords and based on which you have articles dick that could be pulled up in so that you know you basically empower your customers to handle the queries for themselves woofle at the end of the day reduce on the volume of the tickets that come into your helpdesk system too.
prospect,so then would we from that page that you had a say we want to link our support page that you saw would we link then from our support page url to the freshdesk page that you have that configuration yeah.
rep,exactly all you got to do is add a link that there and say that once that hyperlink is clicked up on you directed to the url that you provide there.
rep,alright and of course you also have the option to have your own vanity url once you have that domain added in your dns zones right.
rep,so in that way you could use your own specific urls to.
rep,okay alright and so in this way you could go about setting up these articles and of course one other benefit is you can also have a form like similar to the contact us form that you have here on your support portal exist and even here in fact you know when you're summers are you know trying to reach up to you for a query when they open the subject of that specific query you can still pull up these solution articles which will prevent them from going ahead and submitting this ticket rather you know yeah getting those questions answered for themselves here right.
rep,and of course would you know how to go about setting up to solution solutions tab this it's basically a three level hierarchy that we have here the first is the category and below the category we have folders and folders the articles and we can also go ahead and you know set restrictions at the folder level to say that you know you have you can say that only specific companies could access these sets of documents or you can also have a segregation that says that it's only these internal documents which are to be accessed just by the agents of the system or of course you also have the option to say that you know anyone who has access to our website can go ahead and you know access these helpdesk documents right.
rep,so yeah that's the break that's how you could go about setting up the solution articles and one other benefit of doing that is in cases when you know you're responding to your customers you also have this option to like like we are talking about scanned responses once you have that you connected your helpdesk with your support portal you also have the option to directly insert the solution articles as responses you know going out either it could be the complete content of it or just the link of that article right so that's something that you could you should be able to do that.
rep,right guys so this is about the customer support portal so any questions would the so far.
prospect,looks good.
rep,alright so that is you know pretty much about what i thought that take you to the demonstration of the help desk system guys so any other workflows that you would like to discuss to see if help desk if recessed is a good fit.
prospect,like i said you know we're already using it i think you know press in terms of implantation for us is this more i would you take advantage of some of those additional functions you like you to the web creating a knowledge base like you showed with some of those articles and other complication and then you know certainly would be really interesting then is you know what can we do to to link in some of the crm capabilities on top of that.
rep,well right here so with the crm of course in other two minutes i think you know we can have the balaji linking you with that so what are you a week so in that case would you also like to maybe have a set of goal scheduled for sometime next week.
prospect,let me get back to you on that i work with amanda to coordinate babble yes certainly i think what we need to do is come up with a almost like a you know a clean up plan if you will to to take what we inherited and point where we can utilize it much more effectively because like i say put on so you can see when you pulled up our website there's a lot of aging data there and i think savanna is taking initiative to run run with this from a support perspective sales operations perspective but one of the things that we'd like to do lean up all that data and get to a point where we can start managing it the way you showed in your demonstration and then also add in some of these other features maybe even adding in the phone side of it to actual service operations in addition to our sales support operations.
rep,great right definitely wait we could definitely do that and you know that would that would you you could see you will be able to see the complete benefits or you know reap those benefits when you go ahead and set that up in the right way and you know when you use it along with the best practices that goes that i could suggest to you or the set up callt sure so you can definitely shoot out an email whenever you would like to have that and you know we can go ahead and do that too.
prospect,that'd be good .
rep,all right guys thank you so much for your time and but before we go let me just pull back in the your account manager ballaji a to the call and i think he's gonna take us through the next step.
rep,okay i appreciate it.
rep,balaji on we should really thank you oh okay.
rep,uh gouthamfirst of all thank you for the demo i hope it was helpful and so how do you guys find the demo.
prospect,i'm good i mean good mean obviously we're familiar with the interface and everything they obviously some of the other features and capabilities is important because you know we're new to this and we know there's a lot more that we could be taking advantage of and we're not so that be part of a follow on call with bottom that her gotham excuse me that you know would be helpful that you create a plan and how we could start not only cleaning up what we have but then taking advantage of these other features and even to the point where you know like i said you know we have a contact club contact center solution but if we can link something in very quickly and seamlessly even on the crm side then you know the team members on the call here i'm sure would appreciate that where they make a call attracts everything when inbound call comes in that's also tracked without having to do any extra data entry and effort that um but certainly from a support standpoint and i think i'll sit down with the savannah and amanda and figure out how we can get more efficient with what we've seen.
rep,okay i got it so on that crm standpoint um you know surya from my fresh sales team has joined the call so he'll be giving you a short demo of fresh sales so if you have any questions regarding that and how the integration works between thresh shales and fresh desk so it will be glad to help you out on that.
rep,okay thank balaji.
rep,yeah welcome so move to surya.
rep,hi guys this is surya from fresh sales how're you doing.
rep,i'm good how you done.
rep,good well thank you no i awesome so i guess you went through a quick demo of freshdesk which takes care of your support requirements and moving towards we're moving on to the sales side of things is where fresh sales comes in so if our sales is a simple crm tool you know and easy to use neat looking interface as your sales reps might be using to have their follow ups going on and automated emails going out outside the system and pretty much follow up with your leads to convert them into successful businesses and i will just start start off with a you know brief history of how the system itself was created and then we can jump on right to the demo itself so.
rep,italy when freshdesk which is our parent product our primary product was there in the system and first sales was initially brought in as an internal tool to satisfy the sales requirements itself however when our freshdesk sales team i was continuously going bigger by the day and at one point of them when we crossed around 120 salespeople for freshdesk alone we had to you know we move on from an existing tool who we were dependent on so earlier we were using salesforce ourselves but how we're considering you know the cost of the crm cost of salesforce and also how complex it was even to perform simple operations we had to move on to an internal tool and fresh sales was initially used internally alone and then was later used and release to the public market around 14 to 15 months before and it's been in the system for a year and a quarter .
rep,and so we continuously have updates coming into the system minor updates which just take a refresh of a page do you know actually load the update and major updates keep coming on to the system again with just a refresh of a page once every month.
rep,so i without further i do i will you know start sharing my screen so this is you know the first sales crm itself which you might be seen me one second awesome so this is the main page of the crm tool once you're inside the crm and this one the left pane that you see is the menu pane where you have four major core modules and leads first one being leads second one being contacts third accounts and the last one being deals so leader where all your leads are you know the people who approach your business ideally so they might be junk they might be genuine so there's just a mixture about junk and genuine leads who you have to actually follow up or get in touch to to see whether they will be giving you business so they these people will be in leads and once you have your follow up process let's say you make a phone call or you have email conversations with them and then you find out they are actually interested in your product then you convert the lead into a contact and an account is nothing but you know just in organization or the company to which the contacts belong to and the deals are just a deal values or the business values in which of which are the contacts might be giving your business so let's just say a deal value of five hundred dollars might actually be a deal associated with a contact who might be associated with an account yes.
rep,and going into the crm system itself i will show you a sample leader or a contact in the system and how every activity and every task or note of the of the particularly door contact is captured in the system so here you have all the contact information of the leader of contact itself you have when you click on the edit option you get more options related to that particular need or contact so let's just say you have this particular contact jonathan dickie you have all his information in the system up here so every information can be captured you can also create your own custom fields now you can also click over this field you can also type which field you want to go into directly and you know you can bring in those search crystals and further when you're doing up your follow up processes where when we go to a lead or particularly so let's just go to this particular lead and when i go to this lead i have lead changes over here so let us say a new lead comes in it's going to be in a new stage i can also you know schedule a meeting maybe i don't nearby coffee shop have a meeting scheduled this one or let's just say i have a call with them and then there they seem to be not interested in the product i can move them to unqualified as well so all these stages are completely customizable according to your business requirements.
rep,coming back to this page after you have a phone call or an email conversation you can also have notes that are stored you can also have tasks that you assign to yourself and the fresh sale system along with your default mailbox such as google will remind you accordingly and when you're scheduling appointments you can also loop in external collaborators or your clients themselves in this case jonathan d key you can include him is in an appointment and it will automatically sync with your google calendar and jonathan's calendar as well so it integrates pretty well with google calendar and further you can also add files corresponding to that particular contact you can just you know put in drag and drop into the option over here you can also add google drive's or dropbox links and these files will be stored on the system offline and further when you go every phone call or every email conversation can be made right from within the fresh sale system because one of our main objectives was to eliminate the use of external tools so that's why we have the phone interface over here where you can you know just click the dial pad to pop up the dial pad you can also view all your call logs you can also switch between your browser and phone so in case you're not available on the browser you can always you know forward these browser calls to your mobile phone and answer those calls from your mobile phone itself every call that you make to that lead or contact can also be optionally recorded so you can you know being an admin or being a user of yourself if you want to come back to that call and listen you can just click the play button and it's going to play the entire call for you.
rep,and just like any other mobile number you can always set up a voicemail yeah.
rep,sorry i'm the call recording then is that is that just part of the monthly package or is it based on volume.
rep,so the call recording feature is completely free of charge we do not you know charge you anything for the recording feature however the phone calls you will be paying by the minute.
rep,okay and that's because we're going then we're routing it through your sims trunk and your sides are in yes ideally so when you get started on the phone interface you will have the option to by any local or toll-free number that we brought so we have a large list of numbers that you can choose from and we also give you five dollars worth of credit to get you started so you can use one dollar from the five dollars to buy a number and then get started on the system itself so after i already.
prospect,what if we have our own numbers we just want to use our own can we just not easily avoid the full charges.
rep,if you have your own number and if you still want the recording and the you know we also have the call masking feature so if you want that number we can port the number into the first sale system and you can continue using the same number however what will happen is you will start adopting our call charges.
rep,yeah and and our culture's are.
rep,1.6 cents per a minute.
rep,and coming back is where you know you have all your phone conversations being listed in the same leader contact you are calling so if you go to jonathan dickies page you have all the phone conversations follow the emails along with the time frame along with the time line so you have every email that you sent you have manual call logs you know you have phone conversations that you can list from and regarding the email interface which i just you know forgot to mention before this i will just click on jonathan i will pop up the email interface for you so this is the standard email interface that you have in fresh sales it is similar to your gmail itself so as you adopt the system you might actually replace your default mailbox with the fresh sales mailbox so because we have every feature that your standard mailbox offers right from the formatting options to attachments links as well what what is the extra feature that we have over here is the email tracking feature where you'll be able to track every email that you send out of the system so when your clients are opening an email clicking on a particular link in the email or even replying to the email for that fact so you get real-time notifications right right in the system.
rep,you can also add attachments right from here you can also schedule your emails to go at a later time you can just set up a date and a time and the mail's are going to go automatically scheduled.
rep,so this might be pretty useful when you're doing your follow-ups in bulk so let's say you have a bunch of leads 20 leads coming into the system today and you shoot a single email a bulk email to all 20 of them you're running a campaign you can also schedule a follow-up campaign maybe 5 to 10 days from now so.
rep,and the best part is you will also get real-time notifications for every open or every email email what you're getting so if you're shooting out 20 emails and 18of 18 of them are opening you'll get individual notification as to who is opened who is replied as well and further coming down is where you have the integration with freshdesk so every customer or in freshdesk and every contact in fresh sales are integrated and the email address acts as an identifier and links and enters links the two software's so any ticket that you have in fresh sales freshdesk will be reciprocated and shown for you in the fresh sale system right in the same lead or contact itself and you can just click the ticket from here and you can start editing that particular ticket you can start viewing the ticket information right from within fresh sales so it's pretty much a fresh desk in your fresh sales so you can view all the ticket information you can you know also start updating your freshdesk fields right from your you can add notes so it's a typical freshdesk interface embedded in a fresh sale system.
prospect,okay what about obviously is managing your contact activity what about actual proposals that are being sent to those contacts.
rep,mm-hmm so you'd like to send sort sort of like coats or contracts to your contacts .
rep,perfect so these go in as attachments so if youacquired have a link in the email which further redirects you to you know another page where you can download then those can be monitored however if you're just having an attachment the system only tracks the opening of an email and does not track a downloading of the file.
prospect,it tracks right now.
rep,it tracks only the opening of the email and it does not track any if the file has been downloaded of the contract has been downloaded and if you a if you were asking about direct code creation or direct you know contract creation right from the crm system that is not possible.
prospect,i'm just thinking in terms of if somebody sends an email to like customers.
prospect,the quote or whatever that's if you attach the inside this.
rep,oh oh okay okay yes you will get the attachment in the crm system.
rep,you will get it in the same email itself and you can start downloading i doubt if i have an attachment in the test account but yes you will be able to download the file .
prospect,so .
rep,further every call or every email that you're starting to do from within the system will be tracked in your recent activities and i was also seeing your website earlier when balaji was on the call as well so just like you have a support forum on your website where you you know you can enter all the information and you know take this information regarding the support query to freshdesk you can also do a similar thing from your contact us page to fresh sales so all your sales related questions are brought into the system directly so let's say a client is interested in your service or product this is enter all the information and click send as soon as send is clicked the system starts tracking their activities the system starts tracking all their activities right from when they viewed the webpage so this is one of our test accounts on our website so he's come out come up on our website to the apps page he's landed on that page and then he's moved on to the signup page and then he's filled up the form and gone to the signup thank you page and then the system automatically creates in lead under his name and then it assigns to one of our sales representatives and further a few in-app activity is tracking is done where you know you can configure the system to track what is happening after a date download so let's say you have a download brochure form on your website you can see if they're actually downloading a brochure you can you can track activities that are happening inside your application as well and then you know your sales reps outgoing calls are tracked further you know the lead stage movement there's their activities on your website again and depending upon every activity of the contact or the lead with the system their lead score is automatically increased so the number that you see right next to the contact is actually his lead score on a zero to ninety nine basis so with every conversation or every phone call or every activity of the contact on the website his lead score continuously increases so in this way you will actually be able to differentiate between a junk and the genuine lead and focus more on the more important clients yes yes and regarding the website tracking once the form is filled even activities of the client prior to the filling up of the form will also be noted so all that we have to do is just make the point fill up the form so that you know is cookies from his side or activated and we have all the information of his activities on our website.
rep,and further that is pretty much with the leads and contacts because leads and contacts page are exactly similar you have the follow up stages in the leads as i was showing you you have the follow up stages in the leads and in the contacts page instead of the follow up stages that you have in the leads you just have the deal value itself so you just have the deal value so as soon as you have a lead you can actually go ahead and click convert so let us say this is a person who is really interested in your product and he is in the lead stage so you can click on convert and convert the contact lead into a contact by just assigning a deal probably just give a name to the deal such as you know on a golden plan over the golden plan give any name and then associate the deal with the deal value give your custom fields you can make fields mandatory as well and then click convert so what this is going to do is create a contact it will automatically create an account with the name that you given and also create a deal with the deal value we will give and with multiple pipelines in the system you can also have different teams working on the system so let's say you have an inbound team and an outbound team you can have different pipelines and different sales process for your teams as well i will skip the accounts part because every four this is because the accounts part is really simple it's just the account and the account information itself and you also have the related contacts so that you know you can just search by a search by n account and then go into the account and then click on the contacts to take you to the contacts page itself.
rep,and the accounts also has its own conversations its own recent tickets and its do so so and moving on to the deal segment is where you have the pipe line view or the list view so the pipe line view is nothing but a funnel view where your which your salespeople might use to just follow up with the deals or the contacts that they have followed up with so a pipeline view just gives you an in-depth idea of how the month is going on they can just really move the stages across between you know one stage that's the stages that you're seeing on in the pipe line view is completely customizable as well so you have stated such as new or in the demo stage in the evaluation stage negotiation so these are completely customizable as well.
rep,and let us say you have a client who is ready to who's going to demo your product and he is right now in the demo stage if the person is going to buy the product and he's ready to buy the part you can just click the deal and you can drag it down to the bottom and move it to the one stage you can rather move it to the last stage if he's not interested or just delete the deal out of the system as well you can further move between stages right by dragging and dropping or if you feel dragging and dropping is kind of like a clumsy way to do it you can also go inside the deal and just move it so this is because i'm getting this error because i have a mandatory field so once i have a pre-sales contact set i will be able to move the stage.
rep,so that is with regards the deals or the deal value that you have so a pipe line view is kind of like.
prospect,i just i'm assuming so once you work through this so evaluation negotiated phase and then you get to a point where it's closed and given given the time screen via rorty you know about ten almost ten minutes past the hour we got a you're in two months here so i guess a couple questions here's obviously you just changed the status once it's ready for closed correct so once it's closed.
rep,can you show us what happens then.
rep,so once you have it into one stage.
rep,okay so let's just say i will go into one of those deals so this is a contact that isn't currently in the one stage so i have these are all the deals that are associated with the contact and i will go into one of those deals in the one stage where you know i have the one stage and i have a bunch of information associated with the one as well so it's pretty much you know corresponding to the business or the company itself as to what to do with the one stage so some companies might go ahead and create another pipeline and create a support process as well so they might be using freshdesk to follow up with the tickets and you know receive inquiries from the support portal and answer them and they might also have a support team who might work on the support pipeline as well so they might have a pipe follow-up one or a follow up 2 as well after the one.
prospect,process so what if what if we want to integrate it with an erp environment do you have any erp systems that are seamlessly integrated like quickbooks or skinnier though but like sugar or something like that.
rep,yes so as of now we do not have any direct integration with an invoicing or an erv tool but after now how the system is is you can export all your deals and use it to invoice or you can use zapier to connect with an invoicing software but it is in the pipeline and we are we will be bringing an integration but as of now we do not have a direct integration with any invoices.
prospect,all right was very very helpful though what is it by the way what is it first seat without the the dialogue plans or title quite.
rep,i didn't quite capture then.
prospect,i'm sorry what is the price per seat for fresh sales without perfect.
rep,it's perfect so just a couple of quick thing is where you have the conversation support you know you just have the standard inbox send all your standard inbox materials you have your bulk email schedule drafts you open the and bounces and your phone information as well and this one is where you have all your appointments and tasks as well i will just jump on to the pricing and explain you what features are there in every price every plan as well so when the sprout plan is where you have your leads accounts contacts and deals so all your storage materials are completely free on a sprout plan and you can also integrate fresh sales with freshdesk and for the moving on to the blossom is where you have the pipeline view to followup with your clients or contacts until the deal is closed you also have the email connectivity so in the blossom plan is where you'll be connecting your fresh sale system with an email and do the email tracking email scheduling running your email campaigns and getting the tracking feature from your campaigns as well and you can also create your own email templates to be used when you're shooting out an email or running your campaigns and you can also get notifications when you know any update or any open reply or clicks comment you can also integrate with google calendar for your tasks in a point further the garden plan or is the garden one is you know practically meant for teams or sales teams in the company where you know as an admin you will be able to monitor the activities of the team by creating customizable reports so the reporting feature comes up in the garden plan you also have profile enrichment where the system automatically enriches the profiles of the leads or contacts by extracting more information from facebook twitter and linkedin so once just all we need is just the email address and as soon as we have the email address in the system more information about the lead or contact is obtained from facebook twitter and linkedin.
prospect,now what about if we have q we mix and match like we had some team members you wanted to have on blossom and someone golden or someone sprouts and some on blossom if we do that so mix did.
rep,mix and match between plants is common between both freshdesk and press sales where you cannot mix and match it has to be a single plan for all the users in the company.
prospect,good all right.
rep,and your yeah it was a given time we have to wrap up here so anyone else have any fun questions before.
rep,i think i'm i think i'm good that was a nice work on the demo appreciate the inside.
rep,thanks a lot yeah savannah chris amanda.
prospect,yeah the only question that i would have is i saw that you had different campaigns within marketing is there a way to find a campaign to a particular account so if we had different initiatives we can progress their status from a lead to like a closed opportunity for various campaigns and change the status of each of those.
rep,definitely so let's say you have four accounts abcd and you would like to run two campaigns for one for a b and the second one for c and b so what you could do is you could just create a custom field saying campaigns and we actually have a field called campaigns by default so you can just give a campaign name and then assign that particular campaign name to those accounts so i would assign campaign one to a and b and campaign to to c and d and further when i'm going to run my campaign i can use the filter option that i have on the right hand side to just filter by camping or because i don't have the field query that i could use any custom fields such as campaign or campaign tour right here so i could just type in the campaign and it will just bring in all my campaign 1 accounts and i can just bulk select all those accounts i can just bulk select all those campaign 1 accounts and shoot in bulk shoot in bulk email.
rep,yeah and once bulk email has been sent i can also bulk update all those fields let's say maybe comments i could add a comment saying you know i have sent an email i could have a comment field and saying campaign has been run on this particular date and automatically the system automatically does when you've last contacted also so that reduces the manual operation of when you've actually contacted so if you go to my leads or contacts page you would actually see when was the last time i contacted a particular lead or contact so this was.
rep,so i've contacted them july 31st i haven't contacted the remaining people so these are people who have just touched base with today or just a couple of days before.
rep,and this is where you'll be creating your custom fields this is with regards to lead scoring and you also integrate with your website so the webform integration and web tracking happens in fresh sales for web and smart forms and you can also integrate with your google calendar segment to get more leads or contacts say for you to connect with third body software's freshdesk to connect your sales and support systems and mailchimp to run your marketing so in case you feel you you want to run the campaigns but for a larger scale so we we do allow a large scale marketing to a certain extent but because we have our bulk email limitations in certain plans our limitations are 250 bulk emails on the golden plan per day per user 500 emails per user per day on garden and thousand emails on the estate plan if your marketing limitations exceed you can always sync your fresh sale system with mailchimp and do your email marketing.
rep,for the data import auction would help you importing your csv files from other crm systems you can use the users option to add users to define the roles and scopes so you know there will be differences between in the company so one might be a user the other might be a manager and there might be an admin above the manager so this is where you define the users as to what they have to see what it what they do not have to see in the system and third ruiz is where you'll be creating teams in the system as well and further email automations are there where you know you can just bring in automation to this system saying if a person replies moving to the next stage and further we're also bringing email automations into the system where as soon as an email comes in a response automatically goes so that email automation will be coming into the system probably in a couple of weeks but as if now you can do your schedule follow ups which is scheduled features so.
rep,that should be pretty much the overview of the system where you know we have all the modules the four core modules along with the phone email integrations and the third-party integration this per so .
prospect,thanks surya i appreciate it.
prospect,thanks for thanks for a bloggie as well thanks for coordinating.
rep,this yeah yeah i come okay all right.
rep,yeah so what what do you think should i touch with amanda next week some time.
prospect,sounds great.
prospect,thank you thank you.
rep,i am amanda i noticed that that trail has expired for the freshdesk account singed up i'll go ahead and send a trail
prospect,one moment i can't understand you i'm sorry you don't know what's going on but i can't hear you.

prospect,yeah i can hear now.
rep,okay so uh i noticed that your freshdesk trial has expired the one that you signed up last month i'll go ahead and let's end the trial so that you as a team could try out the product yeah.
prospect,you guys what are your thoughts do we need that since we kind of already have an existing or what are your thoughts.
rep,uh if you would like to go ahead with the standard that you already have you can do that because you know your sister company is already using it and you can probably go ahead with the same account or if you want to have a separate account for each of the subsidiaries that you have maybe you can go ahead with the different account.
prospect,you know let's go ahead and extend it that way yeah have the other stuff mess with it this way it's a kind of a fresh look.
rep,okay got it.
prospect,okay thanks everybody.
rep,thanks oh yeah bye.
prospect,hello yes.
rep,yeah hi i did not get your name.
prospect,as i represented <> my name is <patience stery> i'm team member of vongo marketing team and i'm here to assist the demo about <> so can we start <>.
rep,sure no problem and sir also we want to understand i do understand i do know from rohit that you had asked for a demo for our unbxd recommendation product. would you also want to see our site search product also or it's just the recommendation product that you wanted to see.
prospect,no problem please go ahead.
prospect,i have no problem with that <>.
rep,okay i get that i'll spend time a little bit on both okay and just to before we get started what i want you to understand is this.
rep,can you give me a quick background i do understand i've seen the site you you've got the largest e-commerce site in tunisia congratulations on that. i do see that on the site you sell various kinds of products we see you sell products from personal computers to electronic appliances. and you also sell apparel and all the other e-commerce elements so i just wanted to understand from an infrastructure standpoint what e-commerce platform do you use today.
prospect,you mean the cms. its's prestashop.
rep,prestashop okay and do you use any search system at all as of now.
prospect,nope we use only the prestashop features now.
rep,okay only the prestashop features okay okay great to know yeah again thanks so much so what i would want to do today is i had a quick agenda in mind. my name is sharath i leads sales for unbxd for the north american region i used to work for amazon before this and spent quite some time the us working for amazon north america.
rep,from an agenda standpoint what we to do today is give you a quick introduction on who we are take you through some elements of product discovery that we manage. give you some live examples of some live implementations we have done and then give you an introduction to site search and product recommendation. and show you our dashboard as to how easy is it for you to merchandise on our site and then if required we can also discuss some ballpark pricing numbers. and how do you actually implement this product it should take about roughly 45 minutes is that okay.
prospect,yes yes please.
rep,okay thank you so let me get started with who we are we are a san francisco based company we have offices in sunnyvale and san mateo in san francisco our core engineering team our marketing team our product team works out of there. even i am based in san francisco plus we have a customer success and a sales team in chicago and we have an international operations team in india. we have a large customers in asia pac region and hence the india presence is extremely important we have 1200 retailers whom we work with as customers globally. we have 300 <time> in the us alone in the last 12 months we have grown faster than anybody in the entire product discovery space we've added close to 500 customers in the last one year.
rep,this is primarily because a we've built a great product we've solved a lot of technology and search related problems that has never been solved before. we have great scale as a as a customer you can scale up and scale down on demand in terms of pure scale we do about 750 million interactions in a month. and despite the great technology we are extremely affordable and cost-efficient hence we believe that today and going forward we will be the king of product discovery.
rep,a quick example of some of the customers we work with at an enterprise scale we work with target we work with newegg which is the second largest e-commerce site in the us. we work with ashley furniture which is the largest furniture store in the world we work with express they have over 60000 products have over 500 stores across north america. bells burkes outlet if you heard about cvs pharmacy we've just started working with cvs pharmacy on their integration and another large retail store hh gregg.
rep,we also apart from working with these enterprise customers we work with a lot of ir 500 and ir1000 accounts as well.
rep,some pure-play online banks somebody like a deborah lippmann in a very niche cosmetic brand out of new york vac parts shindigz purvida and sylvane.
rep,and the good thing about the platform is we are platform agnostic we work with prestashop our solutions work seamlessly with magento shopify demandwear big-commerce miva platform. and even if you have had your site built on a custom dot net platform we would work seamlessly on that as well. okay any questions so far.
prospect,no it's good for the moment <>.
rep,okay so and then what i want to do is now take you through elements of site search and before we do that what i want to do is give you a quick example. live example of what we've done with some of our customer examples right so we believe that when you talk about site search it's very important to have four key elements. the first key element does the autocomplete itself because in autocomplete if you look at your site today right if i start typing in say anything it could be something like laptop right. i know it's in a different language but primarily what should happen is the autocomplete experience should be visual and guided.
rep,like here i'm typing la p i'm seeing shoulder bags and some racer laptops and things like that but it's not guided and visual for me as a user right. i'll take you through a few examples as to how you build a visual and a guided autocomplete feature on your site right. because that we've seen helps you tremendously increase performance on the site the second thing that is important is to have the search relevancy itself right. if you type in a specific search word like i type in laptop i i am seeing a shoulder bag or handbag right so how do you bring in relevant search results when somebody is looking for information on your site right.
rep,and i'll show you examples of how we manage that the third thing that's important is you have a fairly large catalogue right so it's important to also have the right set of filters right. if i go to home decor on your site right there's so many options available right how do i put in the right kind of filters. and how these filters can be actually very very dynamic which give me more visual and guided for the customer and i'll show you some options as to how you can configure filters for each category. and forth in today's world it's important to have a very mobile responsive solution or a solution that works very well on a mobile app and i'll tell you how we've built to scale to a mobile responsive site or to an app also right.
rep,so first getting back to autocomplete right i take you to three examples right of three different verticals right so that it gives you a breadth of the customizations we do right.
rep,here the this is a company based out of midwest here in the us they are roughly about thirty five million dollars in annual revenue and they sell parts online. it could be vacuum parts and various home decor parts online so this is how their site looked before they came to unbxd right. what you would notice on the website is the presence of two search boxes the reason was because they had two kinds of customers. one kind of customer who came and knew exactly which part to buy.
rep,so he came and looked for buy a part number the other type of customers who did not know what part to buy so they came and looked by a model name. and also what happened is at a back end both these information will present in two different databases so what they thought is if they have two different search box it's extremely easy to resolve to those queries. but the problem is now you are putting the onus on the customer you are expecting the customer to come and choose the right search box. and we all know how difficult it is to bring relevancy with a single search experience here we had to do to two and search experiences and hence the relevancy was very bad.
rep,so when we came on board what we told them is let's have a single search box but we will solve for your business case where you have two types of customers and a different database where information is stored. now if you go to their site and start typing in bissell which is a model for a vacuum part so one side you will see all parts the other side you will see models. the second example i wanted to show you was us patriot so what they do is they sell military apparel to non-military personnel and they had a specific business use case. and here you will see all the top searches which is a recommendation widget right for something starting with b i s s.
rep,a they had a large inventory like you have where their problem was people will come and quickly search by a popular brand like nike. but there are also a lot of niche brands that they actually have on the site which is never seen by customers. so they wanted a guided autocomplete feature where customers can also start looking at brands that they not they don't generally see right. and the second thing was they had a few expensive products so they had they wanted a visual feature where the expensive product can actually be shown to a customer as top rated products.
rep,so today if you go to their site and if i start typing in say ni where i probably mean nike what you would see is one on one side you have category scope where it says okay it could be nike. and these are probably the top three categories in nike based on the user behaviour on the site but will also tell you as a user there is also something called as nite glow gear and nine line apparel which users might have generally not known at all. plus there is a recommendation widget for all the top queries for something starting with ni plus there is a visual tour of all the popular products that's available on the site right. third example i will give you is a grocery site the reason i give you this example is the there might be multiple use cases where people buy in more than three or four products in a single transaction on your site.
rep,this is actually the largest online grocery store in southeast asia they were in the news last week because they raised about hundred fifty million dollars and series b funding. so here if you go to their site and they had a specific business use case one their analytics showed that on an average customers would buy about eighteen to twenty products in a single transaction. so they wanted the fastest way to add products to cart and second they wanted the entire thing to be to be completely personalized. like if i as a user probably buy go to a grocery store and buy say egg milk and chicken every week how can you show these products on top to me so that i can pick those products a lot more faster that was their use case.
rep,so the way we solved for this use case is if i start typing in chicken water you would notice is i get options to change quantity and add the product to the cart right from the search box. plus i give them a banner option to put any sale items that's there for something starting with ch ic plus i show them all the commonly searched terms for something starting with ch ic. plus all the popular brands of chicken and all the categories of chicken right this way the customers can add products to cart very very fast. and beyond this what we've also done is if i am a user who buys chicken without skin chicken without skin shows up to me on top and if you are a user who buys chicken with skin chicken with skin actually shows up to you on top.
rep,any questions sir at this point in time.
prospect,no that's good.
rep,okay this is like the reason we do this is because of our philosophy as a business because today we know we are in the bay area we know we have built a great technology product. but we also know just building a great technology product is not the end of the road right customers like you would only benefit if we can start customizing our technology to start suiting your business requirement right. if you have seen in the three examples i showed you it's not that we have built a same template of an autocomplete feature for all these three customers. we've actually gone ahead understood their business requirement and customized an autocomplete experience which will suit their customer because they are the ones who have to make more money right.
rep,and when we talk about framework what we mean is see today you might understand all the opportunities and challenges in your business but 12 months from now if you want to say start a new vertical. that's where we can come in and tell you that okay with all the experience we've had with working with over 1200 customers across the world that this is what you want you will have to do on day one from an entire product discovery standpoint so that your conversions on the site is up from day one.
rep,okay so that was the first element just to the same examples i had taken as a snapshot deborah lippmann as i told you is a cosmetic brand in new york. and we customized an autocomplete experience for them right so this is about autocomplete so the second element of search is the relevancy aspect itself.
rep,as to how do you when you type a specific word on the search box how do you start showing the right results right so what we did is while you were building the platform we analysed thousands of words commonly <> used words on any kind of an e-commerce site. and what we realize that there was actually a pattern generally anybody who comes and looks for any information on e-commerce site generally falls into one of these twelve buckets right. as a user you could go to an e-commerce site and search by a part number you could go and search for an exact product name you go probably go and search by a model name you might go and search on a specific theme. like somebody could come on your site and basically say party speakers or they might say party linen or you might go to another e-commerce site on a parallel site and go and say casual shoes or formal trousers.
rep,so you're basically going and searching for something by theme right or you might go and search by natural language where i might come on your site and say laptops under $500 right. so these are different ways that people search on the site so what we've done is we've classified these into twelve types and we've actually built an algorithm at the back end. which can resolve to each of these 12 types of buckets so that our relevancy is always extremely high and we actually do contextual relevance. so today what should be happening on your site is if i type say a black laptop so the search system will find do a text pattern match wherein it will look for black it will look for laptop and try and show you the results which is either or or right.
rep,but what we do as a system is something like this so when even if you misspell words on our system like here i have misspelled black leather and jacket. i've misspelled all the three words incorrectly but what the system sees is jacket is actually a product leather is actually a fabric attribute and black is the colour attribute. it will understand what this actually means resolve it by asking you a question that did you mean black leather jacket and then instantly start showing you all the products as well. so this way the relevancy even if you have misspelled something is extremely correct right we not only auto correct a single word but we auto correct up to six words in a single long search phrase.
rep,that's resolving more than 99% of any query on a search box another thing that we do is automated stemming right today if you have to manage stemming from an it perspective you'll have to go and build a synonym at a back end. where you say address is equal to dresses and even if you have to misspell dress you have to go and build five kinds of synonyms just for dress alone. so that you start you there'll be so much of work with your it team that you end up spending a lot of time in building synonyms but the good thing with unbxd is you don't have to build synonyms at all. we've already built a synonym corpus of over 120 million words that will resolve more than 90% of any kind of spelling mistakes or stemmed words on the e-commerce site.
rep,anything to do with stemmed words singular plural like dress dresses shoe shoes laptop laptops mobile phone is equal to smartphone any kind of synonym is already built in right. but if there is something specific to your vertical we also give you the option to build a synonym you can build a unidirectional synonym you can build a bi-directional synonym and you can also build a replacement synonym. and i'll show you on the dashboard as to how easy is to build a synonym any questions sir so far.
prospect,no am good that's okay.
rep,okay if i'm going too fast let me know i will slow down.
rep,okay awesome thank you so the other thing that we do is automated redirect. so if i come to your site and say search for something like a laptop right instead of taking me to a search page the best place for me for you to take me is to your category page itself because your category page will have the most relevant results for laptops. so what we do is if you are looking for something which is which matches to a category page we immediately redirect you to that category page. so that you start finding the most effective results right so the other thing that's important for you will also be filters i did see you've defined some nice set of filters.
rep,but most of these filters are manually configured what unbxd does is it also gives you the option to build dynamic filters. for example if you find men's casual shoe as a popular category and if you feel that there are specific set of attributes that you have to define for men casual shoes right. the reason it's called dynamic is because once you define this for men's casual shoes as a user i can come and search as many formal shoes men party shoes. i don't even have to have the word shoes in it it could be men's nike men's adidas the results will appear with the same attributes you don't have to go and define a specific filter for everything.
rep,so the system will automatically start doing that similarly if you define something for men casual shirts a specific set of attributes for men casual shirts. once you defined it as a user i can come and look for men formal shirts men party shirts men tommy hilfiger men ralph lauren the results will appear with the same set of filters. another aspect that we manage is the variance problem like it might be evident on your site because you sell multiple electronics appliances. you also sell home decor items as well right today what will happen is if you look at my query have looked for a red dress.
rep,all these products has red coloured as a part of their inventory but they're only showing the popular images and not the red dress that i am looking for. but with unbxd what will happen is we've already built a colour synonym corpus at the back end and hence we automatically start resolving a specific colour automatically. any questions so far sir.
prospect,no that's good that's good for me.
rep,so now what i also want to do is i have spoken to you about a few elements of site search i don't want to spend too much time on site search because you also want to know about recommendations. i will give you a quick background on our recommendations before i get to some other elements of search and the dashboard. so the wave you've built recommendations on our platform is by using these four themes right we've looked at almost every single possible e-commerce site. and look at all the kinds of recommendation widgets that people have built and we've identified that these are the most four most popular themes that can help us build the recommendation widgets intelligently.
rep,and all these widgets are built on a big data system at a back-end what will happen is the day i integrate with your platform we enable a tracking mechanism on your site. which will start tracking all kinds of user behaviour all kinds of visitor traffic on the site where do people generally come from to your website. when they come from a specific city what do they generally go and buy what categories are popular what products are popular and what kind of widgets should you should be shown to the people at a specific place on the website. if i log into your website the first page that i land on your page what should be the recommendation widget if i select a specific product what should be the kind of recommendation widget.
rep,if i start buying a specific product what could be the right upsell or cross-sell with it all these decisions is done intelligently from the big data system itself. so you don't have to do anything at the back end right coming back to the core technology behind recommendations these are the four popular themes. so when i talk about popularity what i generally mean is the system starts tracking data for as long as six months before before this particular day. and it'll start looking at all these key metrics on your site it will start looking at what are the popular products on your site how many people buy this specific product and all these metrics.
rep,and start showing all the top-rated widgets based on this popularity theme when we talk about wisdom of the crowd theme this is where we start looking at user groups. if in your case 10 people who came and bought a laptop on the site also bought a five of them actually also bought say an additional charger or three of those ten people who bought a laptop also bought say a tablet. so these are intelligence that this the big data system starts gathering on the site and starts showing you the right kind of recommendation widget. if you're selling home decor or home furnishing it will also start understanding that okay 10 people who bought a three seater three of the ten people who bought a three seater sofa also bought a center table right.
rep,all these intelligence it starts getting through the site and then it starts showing the right kind of upsell and cross-sell recommendation widgets to a user. we what we call as a content theme this is where our system will start creating all the content or the product detailing page of your site. and it will say that if a user is say looking for a laptop which or a lenovo laptop which is a similar product that you can show to a user if a user wants to do say an alternate product discovery or a user wants to see similar products right. what is the right kind of widget that you can actually show to the user right and when we talk about personalization what it generally does is it works on the specific thing.
rep,we what we call it implicit behaviour what implicit behaviour actually means is it will look at where the user is actually coming in from which city or which location or which area right. and then it looks at people coming in from this that specific city or that area to your site what do they generally buy right what is this user doing on your site in the last 10 minutes that is spent on the site. what are the products and categories he is actually looking in spending time on right is there any specific festival or trend associated with the location that the user is coming in from. or it also looks at what is the trend on your website now what is what are people generally buying today is there a specific sale going on it starts looking at all this information.
rep,and starts showing very very personalized widgets to a user itself right let me show you some examples of live examples of some of the widgets we have done for our customers. and again we don't have to do anything you as a customer do not have to do anything the system is intelligent enough to start understanding and showing the right kind of recommendation with self widgets on its own. this is an example for a real-time personalization widget this customer has defined it as hand-picked for you if you want to define it by a different name we can define it as well. so this is a real-time personalization widget they this customer actually sells bracelets so they would have shown the specific customer depending on his actions on the site.
rep,a specific set of hand-picked for you widget this is your top sellers widget it usually appears on the landing page itself so this basically shows all the top selling products on the site. this is a very important alternate product discovery widget there could be multiple reasons why i like this particular product but i also want to see options before i actually make a buying decision. so the best thing will be to show all related products to him in a single window instead of him going and searching on the site for similar products. so they can quickly go through these products and finally make a buying decision on the specific page itself.
rep,another important thing as i told you is the cross sell widget which is based on the wisdom of crowd theme right. this is where we start understanding okay five out of the ten people who probably buy a humidifier on the site also buy a filter for the humidifier so show a filter when somebody is buying humidifier. these are decisions that the system starts making on the fly another one is an upsell widget right i am buying the nail colour on the site and there is data to support that five out of the ten people who buy a nail colour also buy a lip colour. so we upsell a lip colour when somebody is buying a nail colour or we up sell nail colour when somebody is buying a lip colour so we can show those kind of widgets.
rep,this is again a cart recommendation widget i can show you some examples on the site the same sites that we went into.
rep,if you look at us patriot say if you go to any specific category say police and duty you will see multiple widgets right on the first home page itself. one you would see is choose option widget the other one you would see is like a more like this widget what has happened is more like this is the alternate product discovery widget. it will not take you to a new browser or a new window and cut short your search experience but it will just open up a small modal window. there is a custom i can choose some options if i like something i can click on this option if i don't like something i can just close and move on with my search experience.
rep,the other important one that we do sir is actually a zero result widget also like there could be multiple instances where people might find themselves in a zero results page. but instead of showing them a blank page what unbxd generated as is actually show them these two widgets when we have a zero result page. what this does is this basically is based on the behaviour of the user on the site today in this session whatever products he has seen and spent most time on this is personalized to show him the same products again. so that it goes an option for a customer to go back this is all your top selling products for the customer coming in from his location and this gives an option to a customer to go forward.
rep,okay this is the same more like this similar product widget that i showed you in a customer example now this is how this recommendations will look on a mobile device. so more like this option it will just open up in a small modal window i can browse through this and select something and then close and move on. this is how the top seller widgets will actually look on a mobile device just so that you get a perspective on how it shows on mobile phones this is actually a very interesting widget that we have done. this is where we do user grouping so what this widget basically means is say i as a user would have bought this pair of shorts what you are telling me as a merchant is with this pair of shorts this t-shirt this jacket and this shoe goes along is a complete set right.
rep,so by doing this you are tremendously increasing your average order value any questions so far sir.
prospect,no no that's <>.
rep,now coming back to our search examples so another few things that we do in search from a mobile client standpoint is also have a great autosuggest option even for mobile phones. because what you have generally realized is people using mobile devices are prone to make more spelling mistake because you have a much smaller keypad and a much smaller screen. so they have a very strong category scoping option on a mobile device as well so the customer can choose the right option the fastest possible manner. and if there are if it is a smart phone that the user is logging in from and if there is a specific feature supported by a smart phone we integrate that as well right.
rep,this is how on a mobile device the category refinement would look like this is for one of the customer we can completely customize it for you as well. and this is how the filters are shown because multi-select filters are very important this is how you can configure multi select filters on a mobile device and will help you do that as well. so this is overall a quick background on our search and recommendation product any questions overall sir.
prospect,<no i would first like you to go through the presentation may be if i will have any question i'll ask you>.
rep,no problem sir no problem so now what i want to do is quickly show you how our dashboard looks like so this is like an overview of our dashboard here depending on the catalogue you send you can send us the your catalogue from either put it on an ftp location. or you can actually send us the catalogue by a csv by an xml or json once you send us the catalogue or we pick it up from the location that you've placed the catalogue we will show you all the products available. we will show you the feed size will show you whether it's indexed or not indexed we can manage all your sub-domains or if you have a testing site a qa site the production site everything you may manage right here right. once we pull all the fields from the catalogue it will all be displayed here you can then enable disable the fields the way you want this is where you can we will show you all the filters that's available in your catalogue.
rep,you can edit any filter you can also add a filter you can give it a name you can map it to a specific field also and this is where you build synonyms as i told you there's no requirement to actually go go and build a synonym. because everything works automatically on the system but if there is a very specific industry jargon like this is an example of a customer that we have in the weightlifting space. where shoes are actually called as lifters so what they have done is they have come to the system they say we said add a synonym. and they've said shoes and bi-directional parameters lifters and they've created the synonym it's as simple to create a synonym but otherwise you don't have to create it all right.
rep,so this is like a quick overview of how the dashboard looks like now i'll just take you to merchandising this is where all of us make money right. you can merchandise your search results you can also merchandise all your category pages like you can merchandise this section we can also merchandise all these sections also right. so the way you do it i'll just give you a few examples we have created a small demo site just so that we can show you how it is done so if i say dress on my demo site right these are all the products in my catalogue right. now if this dress is a popular query and i want to merchandise this query it's very easy for me to do right a i can go to a report and see what are all my top search queries on my site right.
rep,okay dress is the top search query i want to merchandise them all i have to do is configure rules and say merchandise dress. i create the rule once i create the rule if i click on merchandise the same thing that i saw on my website this product in the same order the same products actually come here. now i can merchandise them i can filter them by a specific attribute i can filter them by brand by category by colour by price the way i wanted or i can run up a motion i can sort them boost them slot them also. or if i want to run say a specific campaign for may may clearance this is where i can quickly create a banner merchandise the product and use this link as a banner image on my web page.
rep,i can also use the link on my facebook add on my google paid ads and so on right so if i want to create a promotion i'll show you how easy is it to do it right. all i have to do is choose boost choose a specific boost level low and high and then say okay i want to boost by title so i can just say title contains looking at all the products okay title contains eliza. the moment i do this what you would notice is all eliza products come up on top right.
rep,now i can basically merchandise them if i find this is a popular one if anybody clicks on dress i want them to see this as my first product i can just drag drop them and in this product. the moment i pin it it will appear instantly on my search results also once second my system my internet is a little slow i actually come to chicago today i'm working out of a hotel.
rep,so my internet is a little slow for some reason so just give me one moment.
prospect,no no that's okay perfectly fine.
rep,okay yeah <> let me just log on to my another internet device just give me one second <>. hi can you hear me now.
prospect,yeah hello.
rep,yeah i lost you in between i'm sorry for that okay so now just going back from merchandising so we were merchandising for dress query. so we had just moved this product and pinned this product now right so now i want to say that this is my first fold in the third slot i actually want to promote a high margin product ralph lauren is a higher margin product for me. i want to promote that i can basically say at slot 3 i want brand contains ralph the moment i do this this is the ralph lauren product that i want to slot. so now if i go back to my site and search this again this is the product i pinned this is the ralph lauren product i've slotted it's as simple so you don't have to go back to it to run a specific marketing campaign going forward.
rep,now even if you want to say run a clearance say may clearance right obviously i'll not find anything on the site because there's no words here called may clearance. all i have to do is go back here and merchandise a specific rule create a rule called may clearance merchandise no products will show. convert this into a landing page the moment you convert this into a landing page all the products in your catalogue will be available and you can basically drag drop products pin products across. you can bring some products right on top pin them the way you want and then use the same filtering options use the same kind of promotions where you want to boost a specific thing.
rep,and then generally go run a specific banner and use this banner use this link right and basically create provide url only. and if you save the banner then the same manner can be used on you our web page your facebook page your google campaign as well. like you merchandise for query you can also create category rules as well now if you want to go and create a specific set of rules and a banner for men and specific filters. you might go and say okay for men price is probably an important filter the most important filter colour is the second important filter brand is the third important filter.
rep,and size is the fourth you can just quickly change filters the moment you click on save changes for everything to do with men as a category will have the same kind of filters. like this you can create filters for anything right this is on merchandising for search similarly you can go and merchandise all your category pages. like if you have all your taxonomy rules will be defined here you can go and say okay i want to  merchandise for men dress shoes you can then quickly go like we did before. a you can sort a you can do a filter and say i want to filter by brand brand equals whatever ralph then all the ralph lauren shoes will come up on top of your ralph lauren doesn't have shoes i guess or whatever.
rep,so whatever is it right and then you can go and run promotions the way you want to run promotions for the site pick up the brand ones right and the same way you can go to any category. it could be men women dress shoes you can go and merchandise for sneakers anything you want you can basically go and merchandise the same way. you can do filters and you can run promotions also any questions so far sir.
prospect,no that's okay.
rep,the third one is reporting reporting also you will get reporting on all your search traffic all your browse traffic it will also give you a high-level overview on the top search queries the top products have added to cart. your top click products your top zero results then you can go and drill down for every query on your site which query is performing really well similarly you can go and search for every product categorization on your site as well.
rep,so this was a quick <> no no go ahead.
prospect,<> so i can personalize <> our objectives.
rep,yes you can <> personalize anything you want it's completely defined on your rules.
rep,okay so i am actually done with the overall presentation the only two three more slides i wanted to discuss with you was this so one from a support standpoint we treat every customer is a premium customer. you get a dedicated person assigned to your account who is available 247 on phone calls and email we guarantee you five nines of uptime all the time. so our site our system has never gone down in the last five years. and we do three kinds of implementation one we can do a server-site implementation which is basically api based it generally takes about four to five weeks on an average.
rep,or what we can also do is two other implementations one is called hosted and the other one is called ajax this example that you saw us patriot this is an ajax mutation.
rep,this is the fastest possible implementation where all you do is just give us a header you give us a footer and you give us an empty div tag and all these that you're seeing is basically a html injection from unbxd right. this is ajax implementation this is the fastest one the other one that we can do is also a hosted implementation where if you go to say rod start form there is the website right. so here are a few type boots right so the moment i search boots you would see the domain url change to search dot rods dot com right. this is completely hosted and delivered by unbxd like if you have too many images and if you want to offload all of that work to unbxd you can just offload to us and we will serve this from our system itself.
rep,so generally on an average it takes about four weeks for implementation and as i told you will give you a dedicated person who will train the entire team to use the system. especially all the merchandising features help you configure and personalize rules the way you want it and also do all the coding at the backend so that your system is built to manage all the product discovery element. it could be search recommendation navigation or merchandising we can manage everything for you.
prospect,<so if there is any changes in the price of the products how does it get update>.
rep,so again you can define the time interval you want it generally what you do is you basically tell us for prestashop what we can do is we can build a connector. and basically import all the data from prestashop and if you make any price changes you can we can define rules at every 30 minutes we basically go back and check if there is any changes done for the pricing. if there is any changes done we reflect the new prices on the site we can define intervals like 10 minutes 30 minutes one hour once every day everything or the way you want it.
prospect,okay hello.
rep,yeah any other questions sir.
prospect,<audio is not clear/understandable: okay it might make the custom php code so i can even using it yeah>.
rep,yes yeah so however you want us to implement so you are talking now about a server-site implementation where we can integrate our system from the back-end you can integrate that also we can take that approach also. but your voice is a little up and down and i'm not able to hear i'm not sure if you're speaking from a speakerphone i'm not hearing you very correctly.
prospect,okay what about now.
rep,yeah now it's a little better.
prospect,okay that's good.
rep,so i just wanted to know sir how many what is the overall size of your catalogue.
prospect,it's 4000 items.
rep,4000 items and you roughly get about a hundred thousand sessions a month is that correct.
prospect,oh yes.
rep,okay okay so from a ballpark pricing standpoint you will be looking at a price of anywhere between $750 to $1000 a month i would say a sas product. this will include both search and recommendations put together it will be between 750 to $1000 if you just want the recommendation product only it will be about three hundred and fifty dollars.
prospect,okay <so it's not so it's a fixed fees now i don't pay as a as far as go isn't it>.
rep,yeah so it's a monthly fee you pay say if you just take the recommendation product per month you pay about 350 dollars and we'll give you enough number of page use and everything and then you can start using it so that's about it.
prospect,that's perfect that's would be great <> it's a pleasure for us <>.
rep,no problem thank you so much you have a good weekend ahead.
rep,do you see my screen pranil.
rep,okay awesome so pranil before we get started i know saurav he's also on the call was in contact with you earlier but i'm curious to understand a couple of things a little more about steiner sports why customers buy from me and if there is anything in specific with search site search or product discovery and that you are trying to solve today on the site so that i can focus more on those areas during our discussion.
prospect,well i think the main issue right now is conversion so i'm not exactly sure what you're offering is but if you ask me what's the number one problem which we are trying to resolve is increasing conversion.
rep,okay so most of our customers you know always come to us with <conversion> whatever level you reach in terms of conversion everyone wants more conversions on an e-commerce site right and and what we what we do differently is we can actually come in and guarantee the increase in conversions and that's how we set us apart from our competition and i'll show you few of the elements in terms of how we do it and few of the statistics in terms of how we have done it for some of our customers in the past right.
rep,typically our customers see anywhere between twenty to thirty percent increase in conversions we can also give a contractual guarantee of up to ten percent increase right so that's the kind of kind of model that we usually work on but before we get into that i notice that your site is on shopify today is that correct.
prospect,yes shopify plus yes.
rep,and what do you use for site search.
prospect,instant search plus.
rep,instant plus.
prospect,search plus.
rep,okay is that is that like an app on shopify.
rep,okay i usually don't come across that one so sorry i wasn't able to get it okay that helps and do you have any any high level numbers in terms of what your site statistics looks like in terms of yours you know sessions a month and on an average or even say site search sessions on an average.
prospect,i think it's around like 50000 sessions or it could be more.
rep,okay would you have any estimate in terms of what percentage of these would be search would it be like say 10 20 40.
prospect,i am sorry you are just breaking.
rep,pardon hello.
prospect,voice is breaking sorry.
rep,ohh sorry for that pranil let me just make sure <> well i was i was just curious if you would have a rough estimate in terms of how much percentage of this traffic actually use the search.
prospect,okay so i'm looking at for the last week there like seventeen thousand searches so that was about a week so in a few and this november so basically a high volume <> basically 50 thousand overall the month basically.
rep,okay around fifty thousand 5-0 okay okay great that kind of gives me a high-level understanding about some of the statistics.
rep,and let me quickly get into the agenda for today on high-level wanted to do four things wanted to talk a little about who we are show you few of the site search elements that we solve today see i actually did a research on your site to find few areas of opportunities where we can come in and make a difference i'll walk you through that and lastly we can discuss on if any other questions you have i can show you some of the roi presentation and our performance and sla and then we can discuss pricing as well does that work with you.
prospect,yeah it's fine.
rep,okay awesome so to talk a little about us we are a five and a half year old company headquartered in sunnyvale and chicago and india as well we have our core engineering team working out of sunnyvale and chicago also the implementation of the customer success team works out there.
rep,we have our back end engineering team working out of bangalore india and lot of engineering work also happens there we are revolutionizing the space with on boarding say 1200 customers globally hundred and 20 plus customers brands in the us.
rep,say from an from a fashion space we work with express today rue21 is another large brand that's in implementation right now but some of the live sites could be deborah lippmann burkes outlet us patriot tactical from hardware we work with ib supply a large b2b marketplace for office supplies hh greg from electronics which is an implementation going to live before the holidays this month. grocery fresh direct healthy planet from home improvement we also work with ashley furniture store one of the largest online furniture store in the us and also us our solution is actually platform agnostic it can integrate into any e-commerce platform.
rep,but shopify we have an added advantage because we do have a plug in to shopify which means that whatever data you send to shopify we can directly pull it up from shopify and start rendering the right set of search results any any questions so far.
rep,awesome so before i could i could get into the details of the solution what kind of features we have right and what kind of technology we we work with i did a little bit of research on steiner sports to kind of create a baseline in terms of where we can come in and make a difference right and this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end but just for us to identify a few areas of opportunities so i hope it's okay if i was to walk you through these examples.
rep,awesome so the first thing i looked at on your website was autosuggest right this is the first interaction that the customer makes on your site and it's very important that you start exposing them to the right categories to the right products or the search queries that they would be more likely to buy right ideally the right set of products right.
rep,i see that you have a very standard template in terms of the three queries four products and then few popular searches right which is guiding but but still could could go to the next level with a bit of personalization with also more relevancy and i'll show you how we approach this for some of our customers.
rep,to give an example say when i when i start typing bas right which could be a baseball which could be a basketball right the the options are very limited right the choices that i can make here are limited surprisingly from on categories you start showing basketball but on the products most of them are from baseball.
rep,same thing with autographed right it could be a much better approach in terms of how you start navigating the customers and i'll walk you through a few of the examples after that i looked at relevancy on the site right how relevant the results were.
rep,tried basketball jersey some of these are chaminade basketball jerseys could be equipments or some of the other products looked at autographed bats these are surely not bats these are some sort of i would say the other products which are not at all relevant to bats then i looked for very specific result right very specific product that i would probably be looking at.
rep,adam graves autographed jersey that's a product you actually carry on your site today but when i searched for it it gives me various different irrelevant products but not the one that i'm actually looking for then i look for the yankees collection you actually again have a category for yankees collection but the products showed are just four and within that category you have a lot more products from for yankees collection basically.
rep,then i look for vintage baseball again a lot of results were irrelevant i looked at category search versus search pages right category results versus search results say beatles collection this is the this is what i get when i navigate on the side to the beatles collection but when i actually search for beatles collection the products are again a lot of them non relevant i would say right.
rep,then i look for synonym right synonymous words where the intent of the customer does not change they are primarily looking for the same kind of products a baseball photo versus baseball photographs right the customer wants the same products but again the set of results are different signed jersey versus autographed jersey.
rep,interestingly your navigation says at times it says autographed jersey but when we get into the product shows me signed jerseys right so i i feel as a customer that both might mean the same but when i search for both right signed jersey versus autographed jersey the results are totally different.
rep,then i look for stemmed words i know it's very stupid of me to write baseball as base space ball but trying to see right even even when say customers make mistake is the system able to understand the intent of the customer right so when i look for baseball it shows me the right set of results but when i do the same thing with a space i get just one product.
rep,and i was not even sure why is that coming up probably it has the words base and ball within the title and that's what it's pulling up a typical text pattern match and then something that's not contextual here but that's that's what i could i could make out of this.
rep,same thing i look for sneaker versus sneakers singular and plural the set of results were totally different this time they were sneakers but very different results then i made a spelling mistake helmets with wherein i interchanged l and m right typical when when people start typing in fast or they are coming from smaller screens like say mobile phone tablet and they tend to make these mistakes with this for helmets you have over 647 products on on the website but when i when i misspell it it does identify it starts showing you some hel helmets but just four helmets and and not all.
rep,so that was a quick quick overview quick research that i wanted to share with you but just curious does this make sense is it something that you see as area of opportunity on the site today.
prospect,well we just started using its instant search plus and we have been testing a different approaches for search so so i get the point here we do look at what people are searching for on our site and <number five our> number one search is by player name so i get the point where you know you did like different searches and thanks for calling that out but you know majority of our searches are basically just by player name.
rep,got it sounds good is it just a player name like i tried one of those i think adam graves which actually didn't show me the right results or do they look for products with the player names.
prospect,so it's yeah it is just a player name and you know if we if we know if you see some trends that you know a particular player has been searched a lot we basically create redirects to to their collection pages.
rep,right so what's your catalog size like how many products do you carry today.
prospect,it's around 30000 skus 30000 3-0.
rep,wow okay awesome so see one of the one of the thing is right correcting it once the action has been taken right so given say you see a trend people come in and and look for for a search term or for a player 100 times or 200 times or 500 times this this month that's when you are going to go and make these redirects right.
rep,so so for those hundred or 200 or 500 customers of yours or the visitors they missed these right experience right that's one and number two is for such a huge catalog at times it becomes challenging to always keep creating these redirects okay and it's not just for relevancy but it could also be for stemming and spell checks right.
rep,one say a 6 to a 6 or a 7 alphabets letter word can be sorry misspelled in a million ways right and it's very difficult to start creating these synonyms at the back end or redirects at the back end right for these misspelled words looking at the trend right and that's where we help e-commerce companies to automate most of this right almost 85 90 percent of your experience on the site is kind of taken care of by the technology.
rep,it's starting from relevancy to spellcheck to stemming and some of the redirects for your category pages right and let me let me actually take you take you to that in terms of capturing each and every feature.
rep,but before that right why search right typically we have seen that search strives 20 to 40 percent of revenue for most of our customers is that is that the case with you as well do you see say anywhere in that range higher lower.
prospect,yes around that i would say here.
rep,okay and and the red flag is say you know one of the research says that 80% of the visitors will actually leave your site if they're not able to find something when they search right they they feel that you do not carry it they will not go that extra mile off of say navigating would move go to google or any other competitors site and try to search for the same products right and that's where it becomes very important to start showing the relevant products from the very first search query that they start looking for right.
rep,here's a is a quote that i wanted to put here and highlight from from express ceo during his q2 earnings call wherein he mentioned as for you know a technology that's helping them in increase conversion that was like i think two or three months after we went live on express.
rep,so why unbxd right before i get into the features piece on high level five things business technology merchandising controls mobile and performances sla right.
rep,from a business perspective we understand your business why customers buy from you something that works for express might not work for you right there is a there is a reason why customers buy and and there is a typical behavior we understand that and try and tune few of this the search elements to make sure that search works perfect for your site.
rep,so i'll i would say <> quite a few customizations that we do per site technology we're solving site search at a at a scale which is unmatchable i would say right one of our customers with with good 70 million products right they are the largest i would say auto parts online retailer in the us and also a marketplace for that so we are helping them in terms of solving relevancy at that kind of scale right and we believe that we can take the site search or the product discovery experience to 85 to 90 percent.
rep,because the remaining 10% we would want to give back to you and your merchandising team because we believe that you know your business best there are few elements of search or of product discovery that you would want to control internally right and that's what we give you back through our merchandising control.
rep,so curious do you have a separate merchandising team today in house.
rep,okay how many people do you have in your merchandising team.
prospect,two merchandisers basically.
rep,two.
rep,okay so we also make their life easy and i'll show you few of the elements how easy it can be to merchandise if you say running promotions pinning products slotting searching sorting right and i'll show you those.
rep,mobile all our features are optimized for mobile and tablets making the experience seamless and lastly performance right we we provide an roi for every dollar spent with us right we believe that we should be making at least 10x of whatever the customer makes or pays for the solution and our customers realize at least twenty to thirty percent increase in conversion we can contractually guarantee anywhere between seven to fifteen percent of increase in conversion depending on your site search statistics right.
rep,our slas are very high we are the solution is hosted on amazon aws with a with a i would say disaster recovery on microsoft azure which makes us a highly reliable solution and we penalize ourselves for even say fifteen minutes of downtime on the site.
rep,any questions so far.
prospect,no i mean i think if we can just jump into what the solution is that would help me.
rep,sure so let me quickly jump into the solution in that case and not bore you with these slides so let me start with autosuggest and and show you some of our live customer's sites in terms of how do we approach the auto suggest right that's the first element of of product discovery right.
rep,so parts warehouse they sell appliance parts online today right and before we came in this is how their site used to be they used to have two different search boxes one for someone to look by part number one for someone to look by model right we came in we said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so you are now putting the onus on the customer to use the right search box. and instead what we did was something like this the moment i start typing in the cell on the left hand side it starts showing me all the parts of the cell and on the right hand side shows me all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for itself us patriot tactical a thirty five million dollar company based out of texas they sell military apparel to us citizens and for them brand is the one was very important right.
rep,and what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in ni it starts showing me nike one of the most popular brand on the site and and starts exposing the customer some of the popular categories within these brands right nike and and then the top of categories nite ize and then some of the top categories.
rep,starts showing some of the top queries on the left bottom and on the right hand side start showing some of the popular products by nike right not just that say the fourth black boot became more popular this week then this boot would automatically go on top and then others would come down to the order.
rep,same thing with express say if i start looking for jeans now express being a brand for them the categories were more important so now within jeans it starts showing me for men women in loose blue straight up this week let's say blue jeans is more more popular blue jeans comes on top again for men women and loose blue straight and then some of the other popular categories within jeans. and let me show you the last example i know this is not from your vertical but i wanted to show you the breadth of the solution right big basket dot com they are they're the second largest grocery retailer in apac today and this is what we built for them the moment i start typing in chicken starts showing me all the options for chicken the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from search box on the right hand side starts showing me some of the commonly searched terms for chicken some of the popular brands some of the categories.
rep,not just that we added personalization to it meaning if i was buying chicken nuggets more often on the site chicken nuggets would show on top but if you were buying say masala chicken more often then masala chicken would show up and in all these cases you will see all these customers <> have different audience right the kind of products they sell is totally different and we every one had a specific challenge with with the auto suggest.
rep,we identified those and try and customize this particular piece which is the first interaction that the customer makes on the site very specific to their site to create that unique experience any any questions before i move to the other features on the solution.
prospect,no i think the main question is i see this the only difference i see from what we have right now is having add to cart as part of the search but how would you how do you differentiate yourself from what we have right now other than having like an add to cart.
rep,other than add to cart the other thing is also in terms of the relevancy right and opening up the right category so if i'll  just go back right and and these are very you know high-level ideas but what we do is we have our analyst team who would spend some time with you before we on board any any customers right and they will would also look at your google analytics in terms of how do we make searchable what what do we make searchable.
rep,so one of the things on say that you pointed out right people are searching more based on your player names right so what if you started showing basketballs and and some of the top players and baseball and some of the top players just an just a random idea that i have but there are few various different elements right that we can bring into picture it's not just about adding to cart adding to cart is a functionality that works more on a transactional site so personally i would not advise you to have add to cart right here correct people might not just buy it from search box because this is not a transactional purchase that they're making it is not grocery.
rep,but it's about guiding them to the right set of products right here for an example as i said right i'm typing in bas but it's not guiding me to basketball or baseball and then you can have some of the top categories within basketballs some of the top categories within baseball that that would start showing right i'm not sure if this is your most popular product that's showing up and is this dynamic right.
rep,with us this is going to be more dynamic in terms of whatever the popular products are they come on top right and popularity can be based on the clicks popularity can be based on purchases made right that's a tuning that we can do in the solution.
rep,does that answer your question.
prospect,well i mean that's <more> is available right now so i don't know how it differentiating.
rep,and is this like say one of the most popular products on the site today baseball.
prospect,yeah definitely.
rep,okay and and how about some of the categories here.
prospect,yeah i mean those those are not not nothing which you see here is static everything is dynamically populated.
rep,okay how about including some of your player names here could be some of the popular players do you think i would help because that could be one of <>.
prospect,the products which you see here are getting displayed because we've been selling these in the recent past at a very high volume the glass single baseball case which you see here is <by far> our biggest seller that's why you see there.
prospect,ben zobrist signed 2016 world series baseball which you see here probably might have sold you know lisike 50 often in since the world series so that's the reason why these these items are getting populated up top so everything which you see here is dynamic and you know there are some you know collections which are like redirected depending on you know those those are like the redirects which we have set up depending on what people are searching for.
rep,okay sure i can i can have my team look into this and come up with some ideas would that be okay and say what what is it that we could include one of the things is how we can include more or expose the customers to the right or the most popular maybe the players even within basketballs so for that matter.
prospect,yeah that's yeah that's fine i would say it makes sense for us to check in probably next year because we just started what using instant search plus so and we have put in you know quite some amount of time integrating with them and maybe actually still working with them.
prospect,so there's a lot of intelligence which needs to be generated you know so that they can give us the hundred percent of what is required for us so i think it makes sense for us to probably have a conversation sometime next year to to basically you know find out where we are and you know does it make sense for us to like move from move away from them.
rep,sure i can i can surely do that pranil but one of the major differentiator would be is creating redirects with us we don't expect customers to be creating redirects we don't expect them to be looking at the report and creating this right what we do is automate the solution and that starts from relevancy right making the solution relevant right from day one and say synonyms right to give you an example say the synonymous when whenever someone uses synonymous word on your site right.
prospect,what i'm saying what i'm what i'm getting at is basically we are you know we signed up with them like like a few days ago so i can not basically you know just shut it down and move to a new solution that's what i'm saying so i think for for both of us to make sense you know and use our time in the most many meaningful way probably like will just catch up like some point next year.
rep,no problem sure pranil just curious when does your like how long is the contract is like that an yearly contract you are in a poc with them.
prospect,yeah yeah yeah it's a one it's a month to month but it's it's a one-year agreement like an understanding not really an agreement but i mean if i mean i'm sure you wouldn't appreciate that i would do something with you know if i sign up with you and the next day i try to figure out a new solution doesn't yeah i mean doesn't make any sense for anyone so yeah so that's that's what i'm saying i think it makes sense for us to basically you know like catch up probably in a new year.
rep,yeah well  it sounds good in that case we can connect back in in january but anything that you need from me any anything that i can share and i'll be more than happy to share any information in specific that you are looking for.
rep,have a good night.
prospect,bye.
rep,and 90 people strong we work with a lot of retailers almost 1200 websites globally 120 plus retailers enterprise retailers right here in the us we work with customers like express rou21 dell department stores we have just started working with ashley furniture bed bath and beyond we just signed an agreement with hsn.com and we've been growing tremendously .
rep,and why we be growing tremendously is primarily because we have solved a lot of product discovery problems that were not solved before and built a foundation for scale from a technology perspective i'll show you some examples of that second is we create custom solutions for all our retailers depending on what their business is and third is we've built in tremendous infrastructure and scale and intelligence into our solution to be able to give a really good customer experience to all of our retailers.
rep,so what we have done of this.
rep,can you guys give me a little bit of background to help you and explain the context of where you guys are coming from and what do you guys manage on a day to day basis at ll bean so i can tailor the conversation for today to you guys .
prospect,sure i can daniel i can take it if you don't i mean i'll take it and then if you want to add anything feel free so so we are daniel i represent the customer experience group and what that group is responsible for is o in general understanding our customers their behaviors their pain points the areas of friction on our digital and physical properties and then try to create think of and create solutions to mitigate or make those experiences better we i am the director of customer experience and on my team are the custom customer insights and user experience.
prospect,customer insights does a lot of that understanding the your customer work they do that through surveys through the voice of the customer and and focus groups and then there's the user experience group who also understands the customer but more more so by working with the customer insights group and by doing direct observations through usability studies so they're understanding customer behaviour while interacting with our digital properties they are responsible for creating the the designs the experiences for the digital properties across desktop tablet mobile mobile web mobile apps and then measuring the value of the improved experiences through usability testing a/b testing etc so i guess that's where we're coming from daniel you have anything to add.
prospect,no that you said it all .
rep,okay that's fantastic so that gives me a really good idea so specifically talking about product discovery when you talk about customer experience is it the experience group manages product discovery say for example site search on your website on a llbean.com is it if site search under that team purview or so merchants
prospect,yeah we have so we so are the ux group would be working very closely with the search product team so there are people there a product is a product manager for search and that product manager is responsible for thinking through you know what how we're going to improve that search experience so they're going and they're thinking about the customer like basically what the the interaction design is i mean from let me state that again but they're thinking about the technology and also the experience.
prospect,so but they they're not responsible for defining that experience necessarily the ux team would be doing that but there is a there is a product at ll bean we have a few product managers but we're mostly project based so that one's a kind of a little bit of a gray area but in that case the search team is typically thinking about the technology and working with the ux team to think about the overall experience.
rep,got it okay that's fair all right so let's get into what we've prepared for you today so we can give you an idea of where we are coming from so what we've done is we've looked at me specifically the site search and came on your site from our our perspective and i apologise if you hear a lot of background noise i'm traveling and our flight got delayed like i didn't get a chance to make it to our offices in time to get to this fall so i apologise if you hear a lot of background but so here's the five element one is search relevance this is where how is what is the intent of the customer and what are the results we're actually showing are those two matching and we want to make sure that you know doesn't matter how the performer search for a particular category or group of products are we always showing the right set of products and the best performing for us the top . second is the interaction with site search in terms of auto suggest you know are we helping them are guiding them are we giving them the sense that they're on the right path of buying behaviour then comes the different variations so how customers might search you might see synonyms customers use genders custmer useo men versus men and error correction next is how many common mistakes that customers make and what is the process to solve them today versus what it should be and the last is the mobile optimisation how is the website optimized for mobile what penny's abilities looks like etc.
rep,so let's get into it let's start with the first relevancy and we'll show you the first example if you scroll down okay there we go so here i am looking for kids accessories and you can see here you know the products that are showing up i'm not totally so some of the products that are being shown are not necessarily just kids accessories right there just accessories in terms of you have your duffel bag you attend to etc but when you actually go to the experience of navigation you can see that there are actually kids products that you call them a kid's accessory right and it's a senior taxonomy fellow being kids and accessories and there are very specific set of products that you want to show when customers searching for that.
rep,so it's a very different experience when i navigate versus when i search for the same category page the next example is ok there we go the next example is crew neck pullovers and you can see here we're probably seeing maybe three examples of pull over maybe not all of them are crew neck but when we actually go to the navigation part of it and you can act see a lot of results there are crew neck pullovers right and not just three there's actually 15 if i can see your graphics so because i'm searching i'm actually seeing see your product right and that is also problem so what do you guys do today if you like this comes up let's say the ceo did the same search or a customer sent us an email saying i can't seem to buying what i'm looking for how do you guys go about solving this is there a team that it specifically goes to or is there a manual process to what do you guys do for that
prospect,well that is a team that works on search relevance there is a team that works on that and there it's a kind of a ongoing work they are constantly trying to improve the relevance of search so you know they have a plan and they they they look at customer feedback they i think are doing all the right things but they have a backlog of course because at all being you we we don't necessarily have enough people to do everything all the time so they are you know i'm sure on the backlog somewhere they have something that probably speaks exactly to what you found .
rep,got it and i think this is a particularly challenges are because when you look at it from that perspective the activity that your team might be doing and i don't know i'm just speculating here so solve for relevancy like this and which is why there's a backlog it's all for relevancy usually is a manual effort they have to look at each query figure out what products to show and i don't know what technology you guys used today maybe you can give me some idea on what that what that is and maybe i can give you more insight in terms of what that challenge would be where they're solving this manually which is why and the way the catalogue for llbean is how big it is you cannot solve all the problems manually and what are you guys do for the deploy a technology perspective before have a background well .
prospect,you know i think that'd be a better conversation for the search team so maybe we can pass on your information to them and if they're interested they could reach out to you but that's that's definitely the good question for the search team.
rep,got it no problem i can just walk you through really quickly if you want through that so the example i can also email it to you if you.
prospect,ya definitely.
rep,and you know you can introduce introduce us to the search team if you're kind enough to do that we really appreciate it and then we can continue the conversation with them as well but you will also have an idea to what we did and and maybe you know get some ideas from that experience as well.
rep,okay all right so we did some research i'll just walk you through that real quick so the next play research for was blue shirt obviously you're showing some blue t-shirts however in terms of from an experience perspective the number of results that you see obviously one was not at least totally blue was more green very completely different set of results that i might want to see.
rep,and then we can go directly to the auto kam auto suggest example justin if you don't mind.
prospect,so one my argue that was a blue green and aqua.
rep,i know the colour piece is by the way no way we are unbxd is coming in thing is we're going to solve all these problems 100% of the time even it google is struggling to solve there right we'd all be there to solve.
rep,so .
rep,what we believe what we have found was this one of a specific perspective typically with the tools there exist today in the marketplace you can get relevancy to results that may be 50-55 success what unbxd is able to do is you can take that number to almost 85 to 90 percent.
rep,and because of the way the semantic search technology that we've built and the algorithms we've written that look at the real-time data of what the customer has done for able to figure out a lot of things that the customer is doing in real time and try to solve it .
prospect,so it is a quick question for you.
prospect,yes of course.
prospect,so what you guys are kind of what you're talking about is a replacement for our current technology or is it something that is an add-on to our current technology.
rep,it could be both i'm not sure what technology you guys do today but let's say you are using endeca our solar or any kind of legacy system like that we can always add on to that or we could replace we've done both for retailers where with the requirement they collect for example they have in too many green processes that are built on endeca and they just can't get rid of it so we'll come in and sit right next to endeca and solve at least the relevancy piece of it that endeca is not so great at solving .
rep,but your category pages etc that are so independent client with endeca and your merchandisers processes etc also intertwine with it you continue to use a endeca for that .
rep,do you guys use endeca or solar give me some guidance on that .
prospect,like i said that's best for conversation or share data.
rep,sure sure no problem but that the system can be used both ways it can sit next to your existing technology or it could replace if you choose to it all depends on what effort would it be to replace there if it's a tremendous amount of effort because of historical dependencies that were placed on it process there built on it you don't have to replace it you can just add-on.
rep,and that's what we did with say for example rue 21 they use endeca for their category pages but search is powered by us
rep,same thing with bath and beyond and same thing we are about to do that with hsn.com which is what i've actually travelled to today we just started working with hsncom and according to get into from that space.
rep,the next piece i wanted to quickly also show you was the i believe the synonyms in stemming again today and i know this is more from a search team perspective whenever there is a stemmed word for a misspelling the the search team will have to solve this manually by creating some sort of a synonym of the backend right with unbxd error correction they go to the next page on page 12 on unbxd aside any kind of stemming detection or edit or error correction is automatically falls out of the box.
rep,and the experience behind that is it's not that we have created a synonym library on the back end justin if you might want to stop go to page 12 please and the idea behind that is that it's not a it's not that we've created a better synonym library and your team is just getting there we've actually written algorithms to figure out whether a customer is making a spelling mistake whether they're transposing letters that dropped a letter in real time dynamically and because of that you're able to solve 85 to 90% of error mistakes out of the box and 95 to 97% of stemmed word out of the box right.
rep,so here's an example a black leather jacket i've misspelled all three words today it's just solved something like that you have to go to your library on the back end and create a permutation and combination of every single word that is misspelled and how it could be auto corrected with unbxd it automatic resolves it out of the box .
rep,the next piece the big differentiator we bring to the table on top of this is relevancy engine.
prospect,sorry really quickly.
prospect,how are you solving that out-of-the-box has someone already done that work of creating all those combinations.
rep,correct this not what we have done it's not something like we have built a better synonym library where we have figured out all the permutations and combinations and mapped it to the correct spelling that is not how we solve it if you actually solve it using distinct algorithm one is the 11 screen algorithm this is a technique that uses and understands whether a customer has transposed letters so let's say or drop a letters for example here i search for black and c is actually dropped the algorithm will actually figure out and say it's possible that this is black it also come back and say maybe it is also blanket but there's another technique called rnn it's called recurrent neural network it will figure out and say maybe in some instances i'll show black some instances also blanket and we'll start to remember and take that feedback whether when i showed blanket for b-l-a-c-k nobody actually clicked on it but when it's shown black customers actually did click on it that means black is a better option for that and over time this algorithm has learned how to solve spelling mistake in in the most optimal way rather than trying to experiment but it does still continue to do that with any new keyword that might be misspelled and tries to figure out using different ways and techniques so what spelling mistake that costumer about to done.
prospect,so how a quick question on that so is it that so suppose ll bean was to adopt this tomorrow are you saying that out of the box on day one this would be working or does does the system have to learn over time on the ll beans with the ll bean experience.
rep,so it will start working on day one because we have trained this algorithm on a catalogue of almost 200 million products we scanned almost hundred thousand ecommerce site builds our own catalogues we also run the algorithm through different public libraries like word nets wikipedia context net etc and try to figure out all the different variations of how customers misspelled and have tested the system to actually try to learn how to auto correct them and that is how we've been able to train the algorithm to figure that out now so simple words like these black leather jackets out of the box day one but there might be some complicated very specific products that you guys might be you might have for example let's say let's say never encountered the louie vuitton okay and but we do see in the catalogue there's louie vuitton and the customer search for vuitton with one t sort of two t okay the algorithm will figure out and say wait a second it seems like there's a spelling mistake we've seen the catalogue there's the words with two ts and we need to sort of figure out and show to the customer some response with two ts and then the rnn piece of the algorithm will remember and said we showed you something which two ts did it work they did not work the customers actually click on products did they engage with it and then it'll start to now learn and figure out and say okay for vuitton with 1 t the correct spelling is 2 ts because that's what we can counter down and now it over then and its now learned so 85% of the time nine 85-90% of the time it will solve that out of the box there are instances where customers will butcher that so badly that it won't be able to pick it up and you see the traditional way of trying to correct it by creating synonyms is the is still available.
prospect,yes okay good great thanks for that.
rep,sure yeah no well the next piece is the relevancy so how we have solve relevancy this is a big component is are you there justin okay alright so relevancy piece will show you an example called the brown leather belt if i'm searching for brown leather belt our system actually understands that belt is a product brown is the colour attributes and leather in the fabric attribute of the material attribute which is why we will first find all the belt well then maybe boost all the brown leather belts up top maybe then we'll show you some black leather belts and some other belts also and it all depends in the configuration you might come in and say as a business when somebody searches for brown leather belt i only want to show brownlow's i want to show any other belt at all then you only show brown to the bill but you might come in and say you know what we don't stock one type or one style of products in so much quantity so let's show the right results of top but then also show some other types of results so then we'll show brown leather belt up top black leather belt below that and some other types of belt as well.
rep,so but there's what techniques that you might have available with the searching which is why there's a backlog rob is to solve for this they have to manually go in per query and solve the relevancy by moving the product interactively manually this is something that we bought out of the box day 1.
rep,day 1 you go live because something that be solved automatically.
rep,okay alright the next piece and and this is our philosophy level so we don't necessarily ask your team to spend a lot of time fixing problems we ask your team to let the system solve a lot of problems but spend their time to actually optimise based on what the business requirements of the business requirement might be where you need to be able to optimise for high inventory you might need to be able to optimise for clearance for high inventory for high margin for seasonality for brand from oceans etc you should be spending time doing that on it fixing search problem so we have a merchandising dashboard on the back end that also allows you to you that seems like justin is having some internet problems sorry for that.
prospect,yeah mines thing a bit wacky and it's a pdf format sometimes it's a call to it .
prospect,where actually i think i'm sorry to cut you off but we're actually at time we have we have another meeting right after this so .
prospect,i wanted it if you could send us um well two things if we read through the deck is it self-explanatory.
prospect,and if so can you send it to us and then we can talk through it and then you know a lot of this seems to be associated with search.
rep,yep
prospect,yeah we could after we look at it we could talk to our search partners and and if they're interested we could introduce you.
rep,absolutely so what we wanted to focus today was rob search but we do from a product discovery perspective do you have a product for your category pages and you have a very unique way in terms of how we look at it top of the <> spend to get in the top of the funnel to get customers to the site what is that middle of the funnel team doing to optimise for that customers experience.
prospect,yeah that might be that might be interesting why don't you first understand us what you were planning on presenting to us today and if you could do that in the next you know couple days.
prospect,that's fair for all of us.
rep,yeah absolutely more than happy and what we love to do rob at separate emails will send you a a small deck that we presented at a conference call e-tail west so you can see what i was talking about from a category pages perspective also.
prospect,that'd be perfect i'm familiar with e-tail west.
rep,awesome.
prospect,that'd be awesome that would be that would be great we could take a look at that.
rep,absolutely so rob who should we bother maybe not next week week after to read mother you and try to reach out to you to see if there's any opportunity to make for the conversation maybe you can introduce it as a search team or maybe you're interested in the category pages experience.
prospect,i think you can absolutely reach out to me i think you have my email address so.
prospect,when you go ahead and do that.
rep,okay perfect well thank you so much rob really appreciate your time and thank you so sorry about going over a little bit sorry for being late today i do apologise for that thank you for your time and we look forward to talking to you again.
prospect,okay thanks.
rep,alright awesome thank you.
rep,you you you hey jamie do we need to wait for other folks or should we get started.
prospect,is there anybody else on
rep,jennie this is justin from unbxd so i think we had seen an acceptance from marklo on your team and i'm not sure if bill is able to join us well.
prospect,let me take a look here.
prospect,now we can go ahead and get started i think that there they got call out to a meeting.
rep,great so uh jennie thanks again for taking the time to join us for this call so i know i originally reached out to bill kiss and you know that's how the call got set up so so the idea was to kind of give you a high-level introduction to unbxd gotta talk to you about some of the things that we helped retailers such as yourself with we also prepared a customer experience study for ace hardware just kind of showing you some examples from your site and some of the areas where we see an opportunity and and also kind of you know share some industry insiders and best practices so just to give you a background on me so i'm fairly new with unbxd i joined about you know little over a month ago but i've been in the e-commerce space the last few years i was with akamai prior and the other voice you heard in the call was monal so monal is our svp & chief business officer so i wanted to make sure he's able to join as well just because he works very closely with some of our large customers and has a very good perspective on some of the challenges that retailers like you face today and also to be able to give some good insights into how we were able to address them.
rep,and you know i'm just wondering you know i think i looked you up on linkedin i noticed you're responsible for young ecommerce team and could you give me a quick background on your role and your responsibilities there so that ways we can kind of tail of this conversation to to what's important for you.
rep,yeah so i do a lot of the operations here but i also do get a majority of the analytics so i look at you know customer is coming in to our site what's happening at you know while they're in there and then when they're leaving i pull all of the sales data analytics as well so after after we have we do i do monthly reporting or actually weekly reporting and all of our sales numbers what feeling somebody asking me for something i handle also the in-store pickup program so anything that is in store pickup where are we're using our retailers inventory i look at all of those and make sure everything there is working properly the same thing we also have a ship to store program so if you want if the store doesn't have it in stock we will ship it to the store for you for free and i go through all of those to make sure that everything is working there and again i also pull all the analytics for each one of those areas.
prospect,got it.
rep,so the high auto sales reporting and all of that.
rep,okay and and do you are you involved with the user experience pod on the side for instance sites usability your on-site search of any of that .
rep,yes slightly involved i think there's another person in our team that probably is a little bit more involved her name is lexi so she does almost like she does all this site creative but if there's any issues going through our website that would fall on me so when the users coming in and they're going through the site if there's if they're having any issues that's something.
rep,got it and yes so just to give you a quick background and then unbxd so we've been around for the last seven years we found it at the bay area what we essentially do is we're a product discovery platform that applies advanced data sciences and machine learning to essentially help connect your shoppers to their products they are most likely to buy and what i mean by that is we essentially help optimise you know the overall product discovery experience.
rep,for there for a shopper coming to your side looking for a specific product maybe you know through search or maybe you know through navigation or browsing the site and you know optimising that overall experience in helping you know making it easier for them to get to the purchase.
rep,and you know just to give you a taste of some of the retailers that we work with we work with over 1200 ecommerce sites and you know in us some of our some of the brands that we work with you know so from we got to break it down into vertical.
rep,so in fashion we work with express in rue 21 we've seen some success in the home improvement space with ashley furniture bed bath & beyond that you know just just signed up with unbxd and also in electronics and the lights of hh greg and so on and so so you know just curious droid before i could jump into the customer experience study and the findings that we have <> i wanted to get your perspective on a couple of things as well in terms of you know how important is you know on-site search for ace hardware today and then do you have a lot of you know customers the shoppers coming in and using search to look for products or or do you you see mostly.
prospect,we have a between you know that definitely that needs to be improved and something that we're actively working on right now because when you're when you're doing a search on our site we know that there's definitely some effort areas of improvement that we need to kind of capitalise on that we're definitely missing sales on and it's been a it's a common thing that we know especially our consumers they usually when people come to a time where they're looking for something very specific so that's definitely something that's very high on our radar is something that needs improvement .
rep,okay sorry sorry justin i just had a quick question jami sorry if you hear a background noise you've been travelling today so but the the questions i wanted to ask you was you said it's quite important is search a majority of your traffic today that it crossed over to over 50 percent or is it still less than 50 percent.
prospect,on our site or probably i think over 50% comes from google and then trying to see here.
rep,no what i meant from what my question was jamie that when customers are on your site once again get to your site are they using search more then using the taxonomy and navigation and typically what we've seen with you know large retailers like yourself like bed bath & beyond or somebody else search is usually more than 50% about 60 to 70 percent sometimes of the total traffic every night conservative in customers who use site search are typically 60 70 % of the over all traffic.
prospect,yes that so yeah that's definitely over 50 percent.
prospect,and the reason we have a lot of niche products we have a lot of especially our retailers um we don't bring in a lot but when people come to our site they're i'm generally looking for something specific because this were a hardware store .
rep,so no i absolutely i love a time where i live in naperville so i the blue kimia i think in public area days are learn one of the more famous ones very active very great guy and yeah so i i did shopping at a house like some time and my dad loves it even more than i okay so what do you want to also show you jamie justin if you don't mind going to be so the first example let's right get it right into because i think jannie will be very interested in hearing this so jannie what we've done is we've evaluated the ace hardware dot site across five different elements of how we believe a good site search experience should be right and from that perspective what is the experience that we had what did we find what did we not find and some things were good some things we're not so great and we wanted to share those experiences with you and sort of create a dialogue to see where you guys stand i know you said we're actually working on improving it we'd love to hear a little bit more about how you're doing it.so let's get into it let's say the peace obviously searches relevant from an entire end-to-end site search experience search relevance is the biggest challenge right and we were searching for let's say if unbxd for example and while these are box fan fan box is a completely different item which is what we found when you're navigating while navigating we found these products called fan boxes that actually are the control boxes that go into a ceiling fan right so it's a very it's a very different interpretation just the order of words that come in is quite different with the next example say we were looking for i believe mattress we search for mattress and we got some mattress covers or pillows and but if i search so if i go through navigation or the category pages there's actually mattresses air mattresses etc that are available.
rep,so is this a common problem is this what you mean that there's so much opportunity you guys are working on ok can you help me understand so today let's say let's do today a customer came in and said i was searching for a mattress i didn't get it or you know the ceo sometimes comes in and does a query and we've had this experience with other customers and the ceo will search for let's say wine glasses right and he didn't get good results he'll send an email to everybody though the 15 people scrambling to figure out why wine glasses isn't working and if somebody will stop and say wait a second he misspelled glasses for it's not about relevancy you need to now create that synonym for the word glasses on the back end is that the experience today how do you guys go through what's the process to solve relevancy.
prospect,oh that's exactly what i have to do so if they're if they're searching something where they look at a report that is a common keyword search tag goes to nothing so then they pull those and they'll go back and they'll fill those in and then create the link to the page.
prospect,that's the process they're doing .
rep,and when you say that <> i'm assuming the manual activities to find the products create a page with those products itemised in there and then sort of publish it is that well what do you guys use today for that.
prospect,i'm gonna use remote tools with radio .
rep,okay so it's not a platform piece like endecka or endecka's experience manager or anything like that.
prospect,i think it's anything it's something it's specific tool so radial is our current platform host to its formerly gsi who was formerly ebay.
rep,i know that out of you .
prospect,yeah and looking to see what they're using right now.
rep,that's okay jamie i mean you can kind tell us later but so what else i what i really want to understand was so you mentioned that you have this tool to manually solve this we arrange the products actually and but you're only looking at zero results queries like when you actually can see that the result of zero do you also look at low performing queries or do you track conversion for query to see this is not a good converting query let's also work on that.
prospect,we do not track that i mean we've have some of the metrics that come up but our team is fairly small so we are limited in what analytics that we really that we dig into and how far down that rabbit hole will go.
rep,gotcha okay well that's fair so and there's few more examples around this from that perspective jannie but i know that this is you know obviously something you have already experienced assume you're searching for lightweight screwdriver for example and you know you get zero results but if i go to screw drivers and i click on an attribute called lightweight there's a specific attributions you guys have created if i create search for grill there's a certain rule covers that show up and sort of grill so there's obviously a lot of opportunity from that standpoint now the second piece of you were testing also.
rep,was the autocomplete or the auto suggests you might say type-ahead type auto fill etc but today we did not see any auto suggest on a father is is that correct.
prospect,that's correct.
rep,or did we just cracked is there a reason to not see that or.
prospect,we're on out dated platform and height.
prospect,but that should be that's where we are moving to different platforms so that should be changing .
rep,oh okay what platform you are you moving to just out of curiosity.
prospect,i don't think that they made solid decision on that .
rep,okay got it no problem.
rep,gotcha no problem.
rep,the next piece was from an experienced perspective of synonyms and stemming so you know we were looking at a six-inch clamp as opposed to where we spelled out six inch forces we put in six double quotes you know there were challenges with the products their bathroom faucet where we say bath space room with bath without space faucet right then we went into the error correction pice if i make a spelling mistake okay i search for vacuum cleaner and i've spelled back here and obviously it also again shows your result and i'm assuming these are also the types of results that you guys look at and say oh we got zero results because it's a misspelling typically what i've seen historically with old systems or even with other systems you have to create a synonym on the back end.
rep,is that how you guys solve it today.
prospect,yeah that's exactly and for everything any issue that we have is it it has to be manually reconfigured.
rep,got it so what we wanted to now show you from a experience perspective jennie was how is it that unbxd is actually thinking about this and the reason we wanted to show this to you would also to give you an idea of how we think about it philosophically why is it that we're thinking like that and what are the advancements for using technology that we've been able to make.
rep,so let's start with the first experience the customer has with the auto suggest right with the third system it should give you auto fill of the autoclave one we have created a custom solution for every different vertical so you might see here express which is an apparel company guiding the we're down to a category or subcategory quickly is extremely important we have another example of a customer which is a grocery example and i'm not very similar to ace hardware but it's somewhere close to that where i buy a lot of products in a single transaction but i also buy some repeated products and you know the idea behind this was we wanted to make sure that as soon as i start typing the product name of what i usually buy i can see what weight it is i can see what price it is change the quantity and i can add two cards right there from the auto company i don't have to wait for the search results to show up.
rep,right and that is because that's how grocery customers buy grocery customers buy a lot of items and you want to make sure that they can get in and get out quickly with this innovation in terms of doing the auto suggest like this we were able to reduce an experience that used to take 90 clicks to buy 30 products in a single transaction down to 40 clicks to buy the same amount of product.
prospect,oh nice.
rep,next piece is the actual filters so today that's here the challenging problem you're facing and we didn't get into a lot of detail around that but let's say i'm searching for something and the filters on the left hand side are always going to be very static they don't necessarily dynamically change based on what a customer is actually buying or looking for if i'm looking for say one more vs lawn fertilizer different kind of different kind of filters will make sense in a very different order can't just have a generic order.
rep,so that is also something unbxd falls where for each category or subcategory you can define it specific order of filters and we will automatically scale no matter how a customer searches for that product so let's say i'll take a simple example say shoes for shoes of the category if i if you know that you know size is the most important filter then they brand maybe then say colour.
rep,so no matter how i search the shoes mentions casual shoes meant casually the mater will automatically show those filters in that order.
rep,if it's a different category votes for defile then comes in the relevancy key so the next component being the relevancy what we do with that is instead of the top-selling so let's go to the auto correct best practices oh there's no no that's right i just in the stay there on the relevancy piece sorry sorry i made you go up and down yeah keep going down if you don't mind the two or three pages down.
rep,yep that's the one so on this particular piece yeah think about it from this perspective jannie that today you for any spelling mistake or any stemmed words say box in boxes knife vs knives you have to create a synonym on the back end manually create synonym on the back and only after you find out if that's actually a problem what unbxd have done is 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are automatically falls out of the box and it's not because we have built a list of synonym library on the back end but because we algorithmically figure out whether it customers actually made a spelling mistake you have different algorithms that look in whether letters within transpose dropped completely butchered and we also have we use ai artificial intelligence to figure out that if we suggested a particular correction did the customers actually likely did they interact with it or did they actually go back and we we searched for that for the term differently so that we know that next time you need to do a little bit better in terms of what the question might be.
rep,the next piece after that is the actual relevancy practical so here we want to make sure we show you that why is it that we are able to solve for specific queries let's say fan box or box fan because the sementing relevance that unbxd is built in so if i let's say search for a little belt in this example here the system will actually figure out and belted the product leather is a fabric attribute and brown is the colour attribute that's what we were showing you an example in light-weight screwdriver.
rep,we know that to driver is the product is light weight is an attribute so will automatically start showing you screw drivers there are light weight and this is not you have to do manually this is completely automated as a system .
rep,now the challenge now is well what will the team that is fixing problems today <> do what now you have the time to do rather than 15 problems is actually optimizing the business right if you have business requirements you have let's say we go to the next slide we have you have business goals like brands motion you might want to promote a particular new brand that they have come out for a particular category of products with seasonal promotions you probably are now starting to talk about lawn care and mulch etc new rivals maybe you have new products that have come out from that fertiliser alright you want to promote some higher margins pilots you want industry clear so maybe towards the end of the summer you'll have products aerial to clear inventory on for all of these types of components there are extremely important terms of what a merchant should be doing rather than fixing problems they should depending on optimising the business we enable that for you as well you have a merchandising console and a dashboard on the back end that gives you direct access to be able to do that without having any idea interfere or id intervention require .
rep,and the last piece is the analytics so today you mentioned that you know maybe you don't listen to track conversion for a search query what we do is we actually give you data on the exact experience that the customer had for that search we do a one-to-one correlation for example i'll give you an example let's say i searched for like the screw drivers in this example i can get good results then i went to the category i navigated to different pages and i found like with screwdrivers and <> what your analytics might tell you is that that search session at a conversion which is true i searched in that session and i bought in that session but it's misleading because i did not buy directly from search so unbxd actually there's a one-to-one correlation and figures out whether the customer bought directly from search or not and so now you're able to identify queries that are not performing as well and you can now optimise rather than pick the problem so i know i'm taking a lot of your time and i'm babbling also all this jannie i wanted to see is this something that you find interesting is this something that you guys your team members would love your colleagues and bosses would welcome to play if you need a system like this we did a system like this that solves a lot of problems but also gives us the opportunity and the console's will optimise for business.
prospect,yeah i mean definitely it just it really we would need to understand what sort of what does it take to make those things happen i know that a lot of.
prospect,for example like when you're talking about the one-to-one query and then you you're able to hone in on all of those areas that are that are not being optimised like now is there a priority level there like is there because then you know that's where the work has to be done right so does it .
prospect,prioritise your work make sure that we're remaining the biggest impact in area .
rep,yep .
rep,absolutely so if you and we can come in and do a very detailed analysis before you judge i'll give you a simple example that's it today you look at all your queries and you want to figure out where you wanna optimise.
rep,you can look at the the way the customers will search for a singular categories thousand different ways to search the screen drivers right so how do you know when to optimise those types of queries  and when is it that the merchants actually should get involved with optimizing those query so at the base level the algorithm already optimizes based on the christian data so if the customers are viewing clicking adding to cart in orders or let's say lightweight screw drivers as a as a query unbxd will automatically optimize and figure out and say these are the products that are being fast and most for this particular query so we're going to reorder the products sorting based on that that's the base algorithm you can however override that which our merchant with the merchandising dashboard based on any kind of business requirement let's say you have a new light with whomever you want to promote so you want to override the algorithm to showcase that particular product .
rep,but unless and until you don't need to do that the algorithm will take care of optimising the port order of the product it will always show the best performing product up top all the time and we do that at a individual query level rather than a category level so light weights screw drivers will have a different pattern in terms of customer care versus screw drivers will have a very different pattern in terms of apocrypha here and both will be individually tracked in terms of the feedback mechanism in terms of our customers buy how we solve relevancy etc
rep,so jannie if this is of an interest i know we're running out of time i wanted to ask you is there an opportunity for us to set up maybe a longer discussion maybe a maybe a new obviously share this experience with you this commerce search reports with you so you can see and share that internally to have a dialogue and if you.
rep,yeah feel that there are next step to go ahead sorry.
prospect,yeah that would be great yes i know that we're we've got people going on vacation and stuff here i'm going on vacation next week but.
rep,gotcha.
prospect,i think you know we just everybody's kids are going through spring break right now so we're gonna need some time we just had our a our show that we do twice a year.
rep,ah okay.
rep,and that was gonna make before and that was in atlanta so it just did i'm just trying to regroup and then we have a haitian people on vacation so it's it's been a little bit crazy for us but i think that yeah if i can get this and be able to kind of digest a little more and go over it with a team once everybody's back here and we can we can kind of go from there .
rep,absolutely we'll send you the report i'll leave you alone next week in <>vacation maybe we'll bother you the following week how many middles was the end of the week because i know as soon as you come back from vacation we'll have two thousand things to do and and if you can give us a little bit more time with you an hour maybe hour and 15 minutes we'll walk you to the entire solution you can see why is it why is it beneficial to invest in something like this how we align our product and solution with the business and the business goals also and so there's a lot of different innovative stuff that we can talk about and at the end of the day you still get some ideas to say this is what's something you can do and maybe just try to go another way which is fine but unless you'll get a chance to evaluate and see what it looks like.
prospect,okay great
rep,all right fantastic .ell thank you so much jim i really appreciate a time and have a great vacation.
prospect,all right thank you guys have a great weekend.
rep,david actually mentioned us during the q2 earnings call right and and primarily because of the impact in conversions that we could show within the first 90 days of going live i think this something that we can contractually guarantee for most of our customers i would say all of our customers are minimum 10% increase in conversions within the first 90 days of going live.
rep,here is an example from express before and after unbxd right before unbxd a simple query like blue jeans would return junk values of junk results which start showing products which are blue in color which are made of jeans but not the actual blue jeans and the three pieces key pieces to the technology that we provide our machine learning personalization and contextual search that will not only help you improve the overall search experience but also ultimately the the increase in conversions here are some high-level numbers in terms of the conversion rates increases that we were able to deliver within the first 90 days of going life for some of our large customers furniture and home decor 60% increase in conversion say fashion around thirty five to twenty two percent increase in revenue on a month on month basis the average across our customers is anywhere between twenty seven to thirty percent and we contractually guarantee a minimum 10% increase in conversions.
rep,so as our next step what i would want to show is a few search i would say use cases where we feel we can come in and make a difference specifically for bh photo right and what i have done is i've taken the current state of the site taken a few examples from the site and this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end but just for us to show where we can help so i hope it's okay for me to walk you through those examples on the site.
rep,mark you are with me.
prospect,yeah sure go ahead go ahead.
rep,yeah so the elements that i would i would walk you through our autosuggest error tolerance contextual relevancy a few of the search ui elements merchandising and the overall infrastructure of the site.
rep,so the first thing we looked at was autosuggest autosuggest if i would say is really good today it starts guiding the customer to certain suggestions to start showing some of the products right it's visual which is really good the one thing that it that can also be added to this start guiding the customers to maybe some of the categories if someone's looking for my for say nikon is that a camera that someone is looking for is that a lens or is that a maybe a case right or some of the other accessories right so next level in terms of how you can start guiding the customers i did notice for camcorders you were doing that you are showing categories but then again you might want to start guiding them per brand as well there are various different brands of camcorders that you would have you can also start guiding them across brands right so that's that's only another way of guiding the customers or exposing the maximum number of products that that helps them get to the right product as quickly as possible and let me not bore you with these slides and show you a couple of examples of our live customers in terms of how we approach the auto suggests piece.
rep,let me quickly share my screen here do you see the us patriot tactical mark are you able to see the us patriot tactical.
rep,awesome us patriot tactical they sell military apparel to us citizens a 35 million dollar company based out of texas for them some of the brands and categories within those those brands was important this is what you built for them the moment i start typing in ni start it starts showing nike as one of the most popular brand some of the categories that are popular within nike some of the other brands that i might be interested in as a customer nite ize night vision nine line apparel then something that i would have probably not heard of and then their individual popular categories then some of the top queries starting with ni and right-hand side it starts showing popular products right the popular products is dynamic in real time meaning say if this week this black field boots became more popular then this boot would come on top and others would come down.
rep,here also not just that this is also dependent on geo-location so say if i'm coming from new york this brown boot is popular in new york will start showing this if there is someone coming from california as the black boot is more popular in california for this week today or may be this month right in terms of how we tune your catalogue and and how we set the frequency for for autosuggest and those popular products would come on top based on geo-location based on the time and and the popularity is completely based in terms of how often these products are being viewed and bought as well.
rep,similarly express now for them as a brand some of the categories very important the moment i start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories not just that if i browse through each of these categories it also starts showing you some of the popular products within each category jeans for women jees jeans for men in classic in blue in legging again blue jeans something that's based on popularity based on the geo-location if this week blue jeans is more popular start showing on top and then again some of the popular categories within blue jeans say red jeans more popular in california then people from california will start seeing red jeans here so based on the popularity based on how people are searching the products on your site we design this particular piece very specifically for all our retailers. and the last example that i want to show you is big basket dot com they are the second largest grocery retailer in apac for them they had two challenges one they had repeat visitors buying same products in each grocery run and two it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to buy even 15 to 20 products they would come on the site i would say search for the product and go to the pdp page add to cart and then check right so for them this is what we built the moment i start typing in chicken it starts showing me all the options for chicken the price the delivery options this gives the customer the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from the search box on the right hand side start showing commonly searched terms some of the popular brands some of the categories for chicken it also allows you to add a banner here which can also be based on geo-location and category from for where the customer is coming from.
rep,not just that we took it to the next level by adding personalization here meaning if i as a customer was buying chicken minced more often i would see chicken mince on top but if you as a customer buying chicken skinless more often on the site you would start seeing chickens skinless on top.
rep,any questions before i move ahead just wanted to make sure does this make sense you like it not like it.
prospect,yeah it does.
rep,great so the next thing that i looked at on your site was error tolerance then i tried to make spelling mistakes right typical behavior when people are coming from smaller screens or even for from say desktop or laptop and they're trying to type fast they tend to make mistakes right so i try to stimulate simulate the same behavior making few spelling mistakes cell phones with a single l it starts giving me irrelevant results with and with <endeca> today the onus is on the customer right on you to start looking at the most misspelled queries and then configure these at the back end start creating redirects all of these libraries to correct these queries next time right at that point in time the customer has had a bad experience of searching and it can only be corrected till you know when when someone looks into it and corrects it for the next time but with us what we have done is built a technology and algorithm that is able to automatically correct misspelled queries of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.
rep,here is an example from express black leather jacket all three misspelled we corrected in real-time and start showing results we don't wait for the customer to click on to something and confirm but immediately start showing results for the corrected words.
rep,same thing for stemming right if say i was to look for 65-inch tv with the quotes shows me the right set of products the right set of 65 inch televisions but the moment i type in 65 i n c h tv it starts showing me some of the parts on top for tv or maybe for some of the other products but not the tv by itself same thing we are also able to solve with <agosto> stemming automatically all similar puny words all stemmed words and say it was like t-shirt tshirts it with - without the - at times even slangs right commonly used slangs like tees for t-shirts the system is automatically able to understand autocorrect and start showing results in real time without you and your it team having to do anything at the back end.
rep,and the reason we are able to do this is because of our machine learning technology right and we do this on in two ways one is within the site right we try and understand the behavior of customers when customers tend to make mistakes what is it that they look at what are the kind of products that they look at and once we see that behavior repeated for two times three times five times we the the the system is able to automatically understand it and correct it going on right that's one number two is we keep updating our universal purposes by crawling through the web right we so the unbxd system also learns by itself outside of your site in terms of understanding what are the trends what are what are the root words what are the i would say the top searches which are commonly used by people on the web today right and we start incorporating that into our focus as well.
rep,then what i looked at is the overall site search speed on the site the site search pages were loading almost 300 hundred percent slower than the industry standards today the industry standard being 300 milliseconds typically google says anything less than 300 hundred milliseconds is not being observed by human eye and that's where this whole standard of 300 milliseconds come from and today some of the regions especially north and north central and the east i would say are somewhere closer to thousand milliseconds right almost 300 percent slower then what it should be.
rep,here is a screen shot from from for express we took the screen shot on black friday and you will notice all four regions well within the sub 300 milliseconds standards for express one of their most busiest days.
rep,any any questions before i move on i just want to make sure i get i take a pause.
prospect,no we're good.
rep,so the next thing i looked at was relevancy on the site right and before we get into relevance it's important to understand the types of queries right so while we were developing the technology both the founders at unbxd actually spent quite some time doing research on two things one they looked at huge catalogues out there that put up by large retailers and two how people are searching online today and we classified the search the search queries into twelve different types of queries and these are the only twelve types of queries that can ever occur on an e-commerce site we can say to give an example exact search when i am looking for an exact part number model number sku number.
rep,feature search could be red dresses where red is the feature of the product dress thematic search could be party dresses where party becomes the theme of the product dress slangs and abbreviations in your case i showed you an example of inches right i n c h versus a double quote national language queries christmas gifts for toddlers there is no product being mentioned there but then it's it's really important to understand the intent of the customer because if they were to do the same thing on google on amazon they will immediately start showing the right set of results and that's how the customers today want every e-commerce site to behave and and that's where we have built a technology which is able to automatically understand 85 to 90 percent of all these 12 different types of queries right.
rep,and and the way we do it is right unlike endeca wherein it does primarily does and-ing and or-ing or a minimal match wherein say something like a black leather jacket right it will start looking for all three all three words in your within the product catalogs black leather jacket and eventually showing with black leather jacket also start showing black leather shoes black leather balls or say brown leather jacket as well but with us the way we read any any such query is we break it into parts understanding each and every attribute within these particular words right.
rep,so here an example nike black field boots right you break it into three parts field boots black nike understand nike is the brand attribute black is the color attribute and field boots is actually the product attribute then the right weightage is assigned with each of these attributes to immediately start showing only the nike black field boots not just that say you have 50 field black field boots right then we the results are i would say sorted in a way that the most popular products start showing up on top and the popularity could be based on how often they are being viewed or how often they're being bought bought even within within those popular product right.
rep,the popular products might change based on the geo-location depending on where the customers are coming from a particular boot might be more popular in new york versus in california so we understand the geo-location of every visitor on the site and start showing popular products based on their location right and this is what improves the prob or i would say increases the probability of the end-user buying a particular product on the site and that's where we are confident of also you know showing that minimum ten percent increase right within the first 60 to 90 days of going live on any e-commerce site. so some of the examples that i looked at on the site so here here are a few very you know interesting used cases that i want to walk you through i searched for canon 70-2000 mm right on google bh photo video is on top on google for this particular query i click on the link i get the right product here right this is this is exactly the product you would want to show to your customer but when i try and search for the same thing on your site what i'm getting are some some sort of i would say the covers or skins for lenses and not the lenses by themselves right so not the not the right experience of not the right set of product that the customer might be looking at. same thing i look for say dslr external video recorder again when i do this on google bh photo video is on top i click on it the right products that that i might be interested in but the moment i start searching for the same thing on the site the experience is totally different a lot of these products are also non relevant then leica m9 then i look for leica m9 start showing me some of the parts for leica m9 and not leica m9 by itself but when i navigate on the site you surely have the leica m9 leica m cameras out there price sort one of the feature that lots of sites have and kind of tent to i would say lose importance in terms of how it is being optimized on the site today and primarily because of the relevancy not being right on the site.
rep,so to show you an example canon slr cameras right when i look for canon slr cameras shows me good set of results on the first fold as a customer maybe i want to look at the cheapest canon slr camera and that's where i come here sort the results by price low to high and immediately i start seeing some of the parts or some of the cables for the slr cameras so ensuring that now this by doing this way i as a customer will never be able to find the cheapest canon slr cameras right or i will not be be able to find this easily but i might have to put in an effort to now go through all the set of results and understand which canon slr camera would fall into my budget same thing for say canon slr cameras if i was to do price high too low looking for the most expensive canon slr cameras again start showing me some of the lenses and not the cameras by themselves.
rep,here are some examples from express blue straight leg slim fit jeans or say brown loveseat with cupholder this is from ashley we were again able to understand the intent of the customer for such long queries of up to five to six words and start showing the right set of results then what i looked at was feature search on the site look for blue camera you do have blue cameras in your i think point-and-shoot category but when i look for blue camera it starts showing me you know some of the smartphones which are by brand blu blue maybe and not the blue cameras doesn't understand that the blue should be the color of the camera that the customer is looking for. aagain a few examples from express black v-neck for women or say a full sleeve office wear for women we were again able to understand the intent of the customer and start showing results for such complex feature sets feature searches.
rep,some of the non product search at times it becomes important to to make these kind of search queries searchable as well because a lot of times when you have content on the site you have other pages it could be a store locations could be shipping policy delivery policies warranties right people tend to search that on your search bar assuming that this would be this would work like google and start showing you right set of search results and that's that's exactly how most of the sites are now optimizing some of their non product searches also then i look for shipping policy on the site today again doesn't show me the set of results so you do have a page dedicated to the shipping policies.
rep,here is an example from express tried to look for returns starts guiding me to some of the important links important pages that i might be interested in to understand the returns policies.
rep,compatibility search right sometimes people are looking for product a that is compatible to product b right i was looking for say wall mounts for 50 inch monitors again it starts showing you some of the monitor these are not even 50 inch monitors these are some 21 point 5 inch monitors  but not the wall mount and that's where so with us when we split these these words into each each and every i would say word and start understanding the attribute of each of these words and start putting assigning the weightages to them we are able to understand that that the customer is actually looking wall for wall mounts that might be compatible for a 50 inch monitor and not a monitor by itself here is an example tops for jeans right someone looking for tops for jeans we understand that and we immediately start showing tops and not the jeans.
rep,theme based search again say fastest sd cards sd cards are and you do have a page dedicated to it as well the fastest memory cards that one can buy so try to search for something similar again it gives me irrelevant results these are not even sd card here are some examples of theme-based winter jackets expensive suits for men these suits nowhere it well say that they are expensive but then the system is able to understand these are all high price suits that the customer is looking for we start boosting the high priced products on top of the search results.
rep,long tail or natural language queries very i would say you would see the frequency of these queries low on the site these are typically in single digits anywhere between eight to eight to nine percent of of your queries would be in within this category but it is it is important to understand these queries and show the relevant results because the probability of them converting would be fifty to sixty percent higher than your other queries at times the long tail queries meaning customer exactly knows what they are looking for right and that's where it becomes important to start showing them the right set of products sometime they might be even copying this from google or from some other website and pasting it on your site to find relevant research.
rep,here is a an example deals under 500 you actually have a category under deals i can go and search within 500 or within the price but when we actually look for these under $500 the results are not relevant today.
rep,here is an example from express dress on sale say blue dress on sale that we were able to again solve for express.
rep,head query search at time for intent of the customer is not very clear so on an electronic site someone looking for mobile we are not yet clear whether they're looking for mobile mobile headphones cases and covers with us we have the technology that identifies the right set of categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity not just that but we also understand that mobile is the most popular category and we immediately start showing mobile's as as the results and still giving the customer and ability to browse across categories also say over a period of time if mobile cases and covers became more popular than headphones then cases and covers would come on position 2 and headphones on position 3.
rep,filters on the site pretty static camcorders or say store lighting whatever i've seen they have a particular order brands filter by customer rating irrespective of what the customer is looking for but we need to understand that at times some of the filters are more important than others for a particular category and that's where we come into into picture right we make these filters dynamic in two ways one you can go in and define a particular a set of filters that you would want to show for a category so to give you an example for shoes you would want say filters like size ankle height width casual shoe type very specific filters for shoes now irrespective of how someone is searching for shoes with shoes casual shoes sometimes they might not even say shoes and come in and say look for men's nike men's adidas as far as 75% or more results are i would say from a particular category they would immediately i would say these filters will immediately start showing up on top.
rep,not just that say over a period of time the system is able to understand that say width as a filter was more often used than ankle height or size for this particular category then width would come on top size ankle height would come down the order.
rep,any any questions i know we're hitting our our half an hour mark i wanted to stop and see if you have few more minutes if not we can really hit.
prospect,you can continue is there any document that you can share with us.
rep,i will surely i'll surely share the deck with you after after the call <can you give us 15 minutes>.
prospect,i don't have 15mins i can really give 5 or 6 minutes.
rep,okay sharath i think my colleague sharath is also on the call he wanted to pitch in sharath.
rep,hey mark thanks so much for a giving us your time one quick question i had i do understand that we had worked with bh photovideo about a year and a half ago we were in the process of evaluation we had also discussed pricing information at that point in time you decided to continue with endeca so i just wanted to check if if there's an opportunity for us to do some kind of poc show the value associated with our product this time around so just to have gather some thoughts on it.
prospect,i will have to look into it you know and we'll let you know.
prospect,do you remember whom you spoke to here last time.
rep,we spoke to somebody who's works based out of <> i think his name was avi he was an external consultant who used to work with bh photo video and we had interactions with the team i can dig into specific names whom we had sent a proposal in the past and we can reconnect from there as well.
prospect,we are primarily <> to every alphabets <>.
prospect,sure thanks so much.
rep,thanks a lot.
prospect,because unbxd there it's it's it's a customer experience with the personalisation right .
rep,that is correct yeah yeah.
prospect,it was it was actually something that we're doing we're bringing back in-house and we're doing modifications to our current logic that we had and then basically how can i say we went down that path that we just haven't launched yet so then understanding because we were also talking to certona at the time unfortunately that wasn't an option for us so then we had decided that we wanted to bring it back in-house and see whether or not we're able to change their modifications of what we currently had at the moment to see if we can make it a little bit better in-house for ei before we start looking for an outsource again .
rep,okay well that's fantastic because i think we have prepared something that you can show you today which i believe i think you probably already know a lot of that but i believe that you will be you'll be happy to see as to what the opportunity is where the challenges are and how is it that try to approach to solve them .
prospect,great let's go ahead take a look at the.
rep,just a quick questions just so i get the context like and what is it that you use today i know you said is it like own run software like hoc search and inbecka is that something that you have today or you use today .
prospect,no we have we use hoc search now.
rep,okay got it got it .
prospect,we use hoc search now but the way that we're serving it up is a homegrown solution on our own platform.
rep,got it so your platform is a homegrown platform not like atg or hybris.
prospect,nop.
rep,got it okay and from your perspective is product discovery specifically talking about site search or even the category page is a challenge right now do you see that as a challenge or.
prospect,i'm sorry one more time please.
rep,sure so the site search on abt.com do you see that as a challenge today is there an opportunity there today that you feel oh we can't do a lot more improvements here or is that something you feel is doing okay today.
prospect,we're doing okay obviously there's there's always room for improvement regardless if anybody says that there there's they're on site searches bulletproof i encourage them to look again it's not something that you just fix one time and then you don't continue to keep looking at it there's our site search is okay it's difficult to appease everybody just because some individuals are always looking for something well hey you know that when i type this in google with a minus etc this is the type of result that i get back however it doesn't work on our site search well our site searches isn't google that's why you know i mean.
rep,well i'd only get that i totally get it and i think you know from from that perspective let me just share my screen first can so yo u can see what i wanted to show you let me know if you can see the screen so what we wanted to do and i think justin here reached out to you to share a customer experience study from our perspective how we look at it from the outside coming in and what does that experience we talked about to us as a customer or to potentially your other customers as well and that's what really we have prepared for you today so and i will post this conversation i'll email this to you so y ou have it for your records as well if you i'll share that at charlie so just to give you a background i know we had talked about a couple years ago but just to give you a context as to where we are today you know when we met and i believe 2015 early 2015 we were starting out and you were probably a three year old company by then almost five years six years old company now and we work with almost 1200 websites today in 40 plus countries we've grown tremendously in the past three years we we work with one of the top top retailers here in the us so ashley home store furniture express route 21
rep,<>
rep,us patriot tactical you also work with us auto parts frederick out of new york we have started to work with a lot of special cargo based companies as well we were just in conversation yesterday with sears and sears and granger and granger another division called aura tools so we were starting to work with them as well and on the on the flipside from a technology perspective you know a lot of the elements that we had talked about two years ago we've added a lot more and a tremendous amount of capabilities around it so here's the five aspects as to how we were evaluating and evaluating the abt experience one from a search relevance perspective and i know you said then there's you know all these improvements and i totally agree we wanted to give you a little bit of sense to say where some of the more common improvements can be and what how would we approach it and even if you don't work with us you and these will have some idea next is how does the whole auto suggest which is the first interaction and customer has with the site search what does that look like then we have synonyms the spinning and error correction stuff spelling mistakes and then you had a mobile optimisation and usability will show you that as well. ignoring the scorecard right now this is just a piece to pitch together certain elements to give you a sense i would be score it based on the experience that we've had now this is something that has been tremendously unique to us can that we've developed over the past two years there's a quilt 12 query types so what we noticed working with 1200 websites is that every single customer when they search that query can be divided into one of three high-level segments whether it's a query spectrum a qualifier or a structure and we have written an algorithm to individually solve each one of these so what i mean by spectrum is let's say i'm looking for an exact product so i'm looking for a refrigerator a very specific refrigerator what i'm looking for a product type and the product type could be i'm looking for iphones right what is a qualifier would be i'm looking for it's featured a feature of a particular product so i'm looking for a likes a black iphone or a linguistic shortcut would be i'm looking for an 18 inch or 18 cubic feet and how many different ways i might write cubic feet right do i spell it out do i do cu-ft etc and has become one of our extremely important differentiators and strengths that we make to the table.
rep,so i'll show you some examples let's get into into it so to speak so here's search relevance this is where we searched for say eighteen point five cubic feet refrigerators and obviously it shows refrigerators which is a good start but i believe that the refrigerator is showing we're not necessarily the eighteen point five cubic feet and however you don't really have a ton of those eighteen point five cubic feet refrigerators.
rep,the other important piece was let's say a customer sometimes search for the let's see of 42 inch televisions right but customer may search and say you know i want 44 inch television well nobody makes 44 inch televisions so what do you end up showing them you actually try to guide them and say i believe you might be looking for either a 42 or 48 depending on what those proximity size is might be .
prospect,and that was the customer search parameter for this so that your that you're making that assumption .
rep,oh here we were doing 18.5 cubic feet
prospect,okay
rep,so if you don't have 18.5 we could either show 18 or you should show 19 20 whatever the proximity numbers and usually you know and i know i had this personal experience i used to live in a in outside of philadelphia where our house was quite old almost 60 years old and the door inside the kitchen was only 20 inches or 22 inches if i remember correctly so i know we bought fridge and we had to return it because we had to get a really small one compared to what he had bought so and was something that i remember and we worked with the 88 greg who has a very similar experiences as well from their customers the next thing we said somebody searched for was washer and dryer like a combo washer and dryer and you can see here the search results today i think it's giving us some drawers and some equipment and some tools around it it's a stacking kit
rep,for example - washer and dryer stacking kit or washer/dryer pedestal a pedestal sorry etc and not necessarily washers and dryers but you have washer and dryer combo units we definitely want to do that the next thing was 3d television it's obviously showing us but you definitely have 3d smart hd tvs etc .next one was iphone black all right even if i search for same black icon to the matter i wanted to put an iphone black because i tried both for his black iphone or iphone black and it gives me cases and covers when you actually do have a lot of iphone products .or if i phones you can see here these are all the iphones that you actually do carrying different colors.
rep,next was the auto city so that was the search relevancy and with the data that you currently have can you should be able to solve all of these types of challenges and i'll show you exactly what is that approach to really solve that and maybe you can also work internally from the 14 to be able to do that as well next is the auto suggest and here i think i was trying different experiences myself just give me you .
prospect,could you do me a favour could you go back to the the last one that we you just talked about iphone black real quick so i'm just wondering why okay no no no it was the way that you were just it was the way that you displayed so you're saying in this instance if a customer's looking for iphone black and they're putting inside that search box you would display the iphones first right because you hit and it's on the second page on there sorry you talked about you're gonna change up the pagination the way it's going to be displayed back as well.
rep,absolutely and the idea behind here this is a feature query ken yeah yeah here is iphone is the product and black is the colour attribute right or finish attribute you might have a material attribute very different about it i might use a double-door refrigerator i still got to show you what refrigerators even though there might be cabinets that have double doors on them so it's not just a text pattern match which is what typicals out there who do i think is find the word black and the word iphone and start showing you that i have to be able to understand that i'm looking for an iphone and to show you that first and so that's the relevancy piece then you have the user behavior component the user behavior component is important because let's say you're you know iphone blacks but iphone 6s are more popular than say iphone 6s plus and they might be the more current version of the iphone may be iphone 7 is coming out new newly coming out.
rep,how do you actually rank those products because as you can see products so i might actually want to guide the customer a little bit in making sure that are they looking for 6s 6 + 7.
prospect,gotcha i totally understand i understand let's get another example because i can and i understand the reason i know the reason why that this one's actually not being displayed immediately first because we push our products dealer products that's not clicking by immediately down and down within relevance so then basically anything that's purchasable that's going to relate that's going to display first so that's reason why it's there because it is it is rendering back it's just a way the way that we have the the brand of the product weight.
rep,okay so you'r saying i could not purchase the iphone on the
prospect,not online.
rep,not online i see so you guiding the.
prospect,local customers only with contracts so that's reason why we kind of push that down to his bottom so.
rep,now would it be a case where your customers are going online to check out what's in store and then decide to come online and buy them.
prospect,category the the category itself typically they're not coming it's it's the way our foot traffic comes through is really customers or that come in to shopping and you see that way we sell cell phones it's or it's worried about there's really not how can i say they're doing any research on it because realistically they're not going to do research on our sites are doing two research through at&t or apple directly then they're looking for a place to purchase once they actually see that we do so and that's one foot traffic comes in .
rep,i see. so the other example that we television i'm assuming those are more info and not buy of the here's one that's a buy cutie hdtv but what you actually seen is something else like 3d glasses and stuff without a good example or.
prospect,this is a better it's it's a better example i'm just checking to see what the relevancy is because it's inside talk to you you're able to do like a relevancy on its weight and that's the reason why you see some of the accessories pop up before the actual television sets if you look at the actual tvs it is rendering back 3d tvs.
rep,so it should be able to understand and decipher that 3d tv and 3d television.
prospect,yes yes is it pulling back all of them no but it's uh there's different weights that's on depending upon the the category or how that search term is weighed out popularity velocity selling things like that .
prospect,so that's the reason why clothes bag is it the best result for it probably not .
rep,i think this is the with the research for 3d tv tv 3d hdtv 3d television really high-def televisions doesn't matter be able to show televisions and i think the one challenge is you have to do it all manual.
prospect,so and i i've always been i've always been a fan of your predictions and then how you're able to assist with the the way that a customer's intense would be render at the render back i i totally get everything that you guys are are presenting in what your technology does and like i said i've always been a fan since the first time i spoke to you guys it was just more something that we wanted to do in a house and see whether or not if we're going to be able to kind of succeed or not our own you know look.
prospect,i'm sorry.
rep,don't take it wrong way i do appreciating you saying that should you say thank you for remembering us for the prediction because i think the next section that i wanted to show you is actually very much in line with what you just said so let me show you what i was trying to do and i'll show you here's what i was trying to do i started to say let me search for refrigerators and the reason i wanted to bring this up specifically is because as an autocomplete it is extremely important for you to really help the customer out right you know we want to guide them you were to get them to where they might be looking for something very quickly and but still show a lot of diversity and because you do have a diverse catalog to show a lot of diversity but you can see here if i start to search for a refrigerator every letter that i type in you can see what how the experience is changing you see the popular searches that i get.
prospect,mm-hmm .
rep,this is not necessarily it this means that i have to now actually sit there as a customer type of whole thing out right and you can see here refrigerator versus refrigerator this is another challenge with something that you unfortunately have and it's a control of a solution that you have today this is a big limitation.
prospect,could you go back to the are you pull the search to are you okay so you're saying that you weren't able to see refrigerator right away.
rep,yep there's r-f-r-r-e-f-r-i.
rep,oh now i get the refrigerator right.
prospect,i because yeah because once i started typing it i i saw it right away.
rep,but you can see here i still get three suggestions.
prospect,right right .
rep,all right i'll just show you some good just as a comparison what we believe a good solution could and what the possibilities not necessarily a good or bad but what possibly really looks like.
prospect,it hh craig one of your clients because i was going to ask you to see if you can let me know who's utilising your your text i can kind of futz around with their search.
rep,yeah absolutely so you can see here as soon as i start to type in you know r-e you can start seeing a lot of the different suggestions but if i now start to type it f and you can see this is how customers have started to buy to say i have a particular branded mine because see i know we were replacing our dishwasher and we knew that all of the other equipment in our house were kenmore i know i'm going to buy kenmore i know you know my father-in-law's plays they have everything with whirlpool so a lot of times this is how they're starting to sort of search engine say i'm looking for refrigerators and you can see the experiences if i start to hover over each of these segments you can see how my suggestions also change so there's a two parts to this experience one is as soon as i start typing in it's starting to guide me so i don't have to necessarily tell search box everything i can i now i can start getting into it and and i'm visually getting responses that lead to right path.
rep,and you can see how
prospect,and and in those categories that you have displayed versus compact refrigerator beverage refrigerator refrigerator so how is that how is that populated how how is compact refrigerators stack up there first before current depth refrigerators .
rep,absolutely so that's a great question and this is where machine learning component comes up.
rep,so what we what the system will actually do is we will to keep track of all the click stream data and the performance past performances of other users so we know that when customers are starting to search for refrigerators most likely they build a compact refrigerators and maybe on a i just  they might have been a sale and it looks at a rolling case to sixteen able performance and you can also have the capability to overwrite that for example.
rep,let's say in televisions you have the hdtv or smart tv or the 3d televisions that's coming out you might want because there is no history behind it you want to make sure that you merchandise it to show start to show up up top you'll be able to do that where you can say within a specific date time frame you want to start showing a particular set of results on top.
rep,so there is 2 components it's a machine learning piece that runs automatically but you can override in merchandising.
prospect,right okay.
rep,and i'll show you the from an example perspective you know so that was one another one was let's start searching to search for home theatre and you can see it show us a option i understand always the key word in your catalogue but that's not necessarily a option you don't sell home right and then when i started to type in say home theatre my internet is a little bit slow here it's all this there we go.
rep,so you can see here a home theatre and a home theatre system to a customer that's essentially the same thing so we are now actually confusing the customer by giving them the same option twice and so the customer is thinking should i click on this or should i click on that <>
rep,the next one okay next one is more in line with a lot of the manual effort you might be actually putting in to consider the system so today let's say if i'm looking for a computer table or a computer desk right when i look for computer table i'm actually soon seeing computers or laptops but you have computer desks you have computer tables and but it's not there you have dinner tables versus dining tables you know that's where the televisions vs tvs right that was the other example that we saw we're the only way to solve that today is to create a synonym on the back end and that's another reason why when you need to be deliver sorry mike.  option but the one example we had shown will be there were two spellings of refrigerator they were showing up as suggestions that was because you have created those synonyms for all the different permutations and combinations of our refrigerators could be spelled or misspelled.
rep,no issue it's fine
rep,do you remember example we had shown will be there were two spellings of refrigerator they were showing up as suggestions that was because you have created those synonyms for all the different permutations and combinations of our refrigerators could be spelled or misspelled with unbxd is 100% of standards are solved out of the box 85 to 90 percent of spelling mistakes solved out of the box and synonyms we also generate a lot of the synonyms connection and a process of enemy we call it using it on your catalogue and about 150 to 200 million products that we've indexed over time in our system .so here like they see i'm in a simple mistake nice it's a mover with only 100 and you can see the system start to result start to slow up and the last piece was obviously from a usability perspective the mobile experience was also pretty critical so if i were to now let's say and i know we have very little time left so i'll just smush this a little bit it's the same thing with the mobile experience i think that you know from an experience perspective the autocomplete is exactly the same it's just narrowing down to fit a mobile screen but you know from a mobile experience perspective it's extremely important to again guide the customer and you don't have enough space to show images and stuff and right now the idea is with mobile.
rep,in first time to use navigation i just want to quickly get to a category right because nobody has the patience to type multi keyword searches on mobile so that's the other experience that you really want to optimize where you want to quickly take the customers and have a very different ux for mobile versus desktop and and i said here's the score you repeat that again for your identification and from our perspective you can remember can the idea behind this is it's not just a system that gives you the ability to show something it's a system that constantly learns so you have to have something that's relevant number one within the relevancy how do i show better performing products so if i now say i'm looking for stainless in refrigerators i want to actually show a better performing refrigerator not just any stainless steel so so that's the other piece that's the user behaviour piece .
rep,the third component is how is it that we're going to personalize on a one-to-one level so i have already used a filter for particular site okay or a particular brand now if i know that this is the affinity that the customer has to that brand how i show within what brand moves it up automatically not necessarily merchant to do that and that's what unbxd really putting to the table for you in the last.
prospect,i'm liking the modifications and the changes that you guys have done because i remember when i first are talking to you guys it was more about apparel so it's hard to see what the changes in the differences we're going to be now that you guys are getting into and understanding what the commodity goods are the space i'm liking the changes that you guys have done.
rep,perfect <> i like to add one last piece to it.
rep,if you guys give us a chance is that we do like a/b test or pocwe will come in and guarantee 10% lift in conversion if we do not deliver that you walk away.
prospect,and how long would that poc be.
rep,90 days that's a good time for me to demonstrate that .
prospect,okay there's gonna be a couple more questions i do have to jump on another call right now but i am happy would be impressed with some of the the modifications and the changes that she's done to it the technology this is worth continuing phone call and follow-up send regards to this let's let's talk about the poc i would like to know what is entailed how much resources is going to happen from my end how long we actually take the get set up and then trying to see whether or not we could tell us a little bit of cost in there as well.
prospect,if we were to move forward.
rep,absolutely understand so if all the conditions and all the stars align all the six weeks is what it takes for us to do the poc .
prospect,4 to six weeks.
rep,4 to six week our time not your time.
rep,okay and implementation and we have a unique approach in which you can install us peripherally into your custom platform so your team doesn't have to do a lot of for you do most of the heavy lifting and we've only need two things from you we need your catalogue and we need the analytics to deploy on our site and just .
prospect,i understand and i understand that your project you're doing that you're going through because you're basically going to leverage the analytics data and see whether or not whether if there's a like synonym type entries that's that's being there so you can match it together getting in front of it that's that's a good approach i do like that .
rep,well that's not just the synonym piece but also the user behaviour the click stream data lets say a lot of customers are searching for stainless refrigerator clicking on the seventh product we want to make sure that the seventh product is starting to percolate up top .
rep,automatically and we'll also go through and show your merchants or merchants a lot of the marketing in merchandising and support a lot of the marketing and merchandising activities.
rep,so that's what.
rep,kind of an approach that probably takes your team's time in maybe two or three days so half a day for analytics alf a day for for catalogue maybe a day to sort of integrate our pieces into your page may be your day to set up an a/b test if you guys have an a/b test tool rest of the work.
rep,absolutely i'll do that not a problem. what's a good time frame can i'll send you that email it's a good time for us to follow up with you and start bugging you again .
prospect,you can bug me next week.
rep,perfect awesome by any chance cater to be a chopped up i don't need to ask i don't need to.
prospect,i will not be a chomp talk the next show i'll probably be attending as irc in chicago.
rep,awesome thank you i really appreciate your time thank you for the questions we'll reach other with an email and we'll follow up next week again and.
prospect,excellent if you don't mind including the deck that uh that you were displaying to me they'll be perfect.
rep,absolutely i'll do so.
prospect,i really appreciate your time.
rep,thank you <> really appreciate your time as well thank you.
prospect,thank you take care.
rep,or they are looking to build in terms of a platform and i think november is the date i remember correctly that you are going to go live with it you know.
rep,all right so help me just give me a little bit more context paul i mean mercedes-benz you're you're a brand you're obviously a manufacturer and the ecommerce site is it for parts is it for what is the idea behind the e-commerce site and what is it that you expecting customers to do on the site.
prospect,so the the idea behind it is to sell parts accessories you know car care items clothing key chains etc directly to consumer so the reason why i reached out to you guys is that looking for a solution or you know the product recommendations something that's a little bit more advanced and something that would be out of the box and maybe that's something maybe a little bit cheaper than say like rich relevant in terms of that kind of functionality i don't know if you guys have the complete capability that they do but definitely at least right away the recommendation engine is of interest to us.
rep,got it perfect so there's two parts to it from that perspective paul i know that the platform you've chosen is hybris and i'm sure part of the evaluation you know that hybris on the back engine has solar to drive its product discovery which could include site search your category pages for product recommendations specifically obviously solar doesn't do anything from that perspective but the there are specific challenges with solar as well. in terms of personalization within search and category pages so i what i want to do is i want to give you a sort of a high-level overview in terms of what we do and how we interact in terms of the capabilities of personalization but also solve some of the challenges that solar within hybris doesn't know how to solve.
prospect,and regret and and just sort of for some background we're still evaluating between magento two and hybris when i kind of split let down the middle we should have an idea in the next two to three weeks which direction we're going.
rep,absolutely and i think hybris makes sense if you guys are using sap obviously but hybrids is obviously a much stronger solution in terms of in terms of its capabilities to integrate it with the erp systems etc it also has a cloud solution versus magento has magento has some some good platform capabilities but it has a lot of limitations and maintenance is a it's a little bit tricky on magento then this is all we've heard from our magento customers and from hybris customers.
prospect,yeah we're aware obviously it cost no cost for a tight budget for everything and that's why we're trying to evaluate now we'd love to launch with something like your product but it may have to be something we add and you know a year down the road once we monthly get up and running and really just totally start collecting some data.
rep,got it so let me walk into what started within and i can show you can see it.
prospect,let me make sure for some reason didn't pop up.
prospect,okay i should be in now i don't see anything just yet .
rep,that's okay i'll just stop and start again okay there we go i mean if you can see it now.
prospect,um nope well there you go.
rep,takes a second to it we're travelling paul so hotel internet the best has they come alright so i will give you a quick idea on what our personalization engine does so just to give you a little bit of an idea on who we are i'm sure justin i've shared some of that with you but we are a company you've been business for about seven years now this is our seventh year of your vc-backed based in mountain view california you're about to raise our series c funding also and we've grown tremendously in the past few years we have about 1200 customers globally 300 in the us we have a few in canada we're also starting to work with now in sort of picking this up personally we've solved a lot of product discovery problems and i'll show you examples of what those are they were not solved before which is that's truly our differentiator the second part of our differentiation is the solution that we provide is not a completed solution it's not like oh here's our templates and this is what you got to use we customise our solutions for each vertical and i'll show you examples of that as well .
rep,tremendous capabilities we're a sas product but in tremendous capabilities in terms of capacity with devon c and we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery then what do we mean by product discovery paul is how does the customer discover products on the site you can do category pages site search or products recommendations and we have a product all three instances of how customers on that and your platform agnostic you can be on the enterprise and entrepreneur hybrids there's some other solutions as well i don't know if you consider some of these sas models like the connors or for shopify plus shopify plus.
prospect,enough for what we need for your b2b we need to be to be a solution as well and a hundred thousand plus skus it's just something especially with some of the advanced capabilities we need bit it's an attractive offer but just not not there for us right now .
rep,got it great that makes sense we capabilities paul is it like different price in different segments of customers with that like dealers may be able to buy stuff from site as well.
prospect,when we do when we do a b2b here.
rep,okay got it ok make sense and we have b2b customers also we work with ip supply i will walk here and i know a few of them they sell to us they have spores within the us government compounds like military <> and they also corporations so let's get into the recommendations piece specifically so when you talk about product recommendations paul the the main idea in it is trying to understand as much as about that customer to do that one-to-one personalization right but that is not always possible from day 1 so the the concept behind personalization is divided into three algorithms there is the user behaviour this is where what about the user do we know and what are they doing on the site and how do we want to respond in terms of what they would be interested in buying.
rep,second is the product behaviour you have same parts your models or new products for your car models coming out what type of their will be <> it might be an <> that you wanna just get rid of you know you talk about key chains and t-shirts maybe you want to get rid of some of that inventory just to make room for a new stuff.
rep,so what is that look like and.
rep,third is the collaborative behaviour what is collectively all the users on your site behaving like in terms of what they buy how they buy and where they come from and what they end up by so that's what unbxd is done we have built for algorithms specifically around these three requirements so popularity in terms of a a is as an algorithm looks at for a defined period what products are popular what regions what products are popular in what region lists over the crowd is the collaborative filtering technique i'm sure you've talked to which relevancy you've probably heard from them is.
prospect,am  i haven't spoke with them i'm gonna call them on monday.
rep,okay so so this is what they'll talk about the wisdom of the crowd the technical collaborative filtering where they will form user profile groups to say okay customers who buy a particular type of mercedes is it is there is it an suv is it a is it a minivan.
rep,do you guys make minivan i dont think so.
prospect,no no we dont.
rep,so and so from that perspective are the behaviours what are the behaviours of those customers who buy those types of cars and what are the products that they interact with most.
prospect,now is it doing this automatically as you're forming these groups or is there is there a set up that i have to do to say okay here's all the groups that i want and then how does it know what type of groups to create now to put them into the groups.
rep,so it is doing this automatically based on the click stream data that gets collected so we deploy our analytics on your site as well and so we collect that information and user behaviour based on what the activity of those users are.
rep,however this is where so this is where the customisation piece comes in paul if i were to just take my collaborative engine and deploy it on your site we work with different verticals like mass merchants like bed bath and beyond or grocery customers like fresh direct or apparel of customers like express and rule 21 the idea is the recommendations and the collaborative filtering that we have learned from there is not applicable to you right your vertical is completely different from an industry perspective the algorithm needs to be trained to understand that this is how to define groups of people and that's what we do we come in we work with you we understand how you see your groups of customers how is business going to be different then obviously all of them and within your vertical what customer is actually do behave so we work with us auto parts i'm sure you've heard of them they're one of the biggest retailers for parts us based out of los angeles and they have 15 different web sites or property that should say manage almost half a billion in revenue you know and we know how in a lot of different ways customers start to come in and now they have more complicated problems because they sell all parts for all cars and models yeah so they have the 7 a 7 concept where they have to figure out you know.
prospect,what site i'm not i'm not super familiar with with that brand.
rep,sure yeah.
prospect,is there own site you auto parts that do they on other sites .
rep,yeah there are 15 sites i'll take you to i think they have auto the auto warehouse is one of them auto parts warehouse that's one of the big ones then they have they they bought a catalogue company i'm missing the name right now but <>
prospect,i'm on auto part .
rep,jc whitney
prospect,ok video on jc whitney ok .
rep,yeah they all go jc whitney. and then they have some smaller properties specifically for like styling trucks specific for the trucks business then they have three parts trained specifically for another small group of sort of niche segments but for major b2c jc whitney auto parts warehouse those are the big ones.
prospect,okay no problem .
rep,yep and any of obviously they have a different set of problems that go saying that they have two and a half million parts and nine hundred thousand vehicles of doing more than that so the combination turns out to be 267 million products right how do you manage the index of a catalogue that big so that's something we've solved for them as well and they used to use inbecka by the way to manage their product discovery in a lot of sense.
rep,and solar has the same challenges from that perspective at that scale .
rep,so the idea behind that now is how do we create these collaborative groups create these user groups to figure out what the buying patterns look like then there's content base this is your catalogue based stuff which products are actually selling well what geography do they sell well in now there's differences right you have t-shirts that could probably cross customers but then you have certain parts that can only be applied to certain models i mean there are certain parts that are universal also but you have to be able we have to be able to separate and segregate out the catalogue to understand when i'm looking at a spark plug for a particular car i'm not sure that mercedes let's go bad but if there is something i'm looking for i can just suggest oh here's other spark plugs you might be interested in right it's it's not like that if i'm looking at a dress i can show you some other dresses but that's not the same with parts it has to be very very specific to that model.
rep,so there's that understanding inherent understanding of that as well and then there's personalization this is where a customer comes in provides some user behaviour and in real time how do we change what products and suggestions do we need to make.
prospect,so what are they providing initially to change what you're serving them.
rep,well they don't need to provide anything just their browsing on the site we start tracking that click stream data i'll give you an example let's say they are looking at t-shirts and now they have filtered down by based on size okay they're looking oh i mean i it's medium size for me so i'm gonna look at medium size t-shirt and i'm gonna go into a specific t-shirts where product page for example now if there's other t-shirts we want to recommend because we do want to recommend other t-shirts because they may they may really like that t-shirt or they may just be looking at more details for that t-shirt we want to make sure that we show them t-shirts that are in inventory in size medium available right.
rep,we just wanted to show other random t-shirts that are.
prospect,so it will automatically all will be filtering automatically.
rep,that is correct.
rep,how does so now how does it <> the site and automatically start applying filters.
rep,got it so i'll show you an example of what that would look like so let's say here i want to express and let's say i'm looking a dress so here i have this size that i might apply i might apply and say medium for example or small or whatever size stands whatever right if i apply that filter here and let's say then i went into this particular dress as an example the first one okay sorry yeah it's.
prospect,no problem and i do have a hard stop at 9.30 though.
rep,yeah no problem i'll be done in the next five minutes so the idea is if i were to provide these and the recommendations that i provided so these recommendations we will automatically filter from your inventory and make sure that i am suggesting other dresses of the same size is in inventory.
rep,right so this is.
prospect,another thing with with our business.
prospect,you're not really gonna see a lot of that right
prospect,because you're either looking it's more of the recommendation side you're looking for and until you get to the collection side i do agree that that will apply there but you know if someone's looking for a brake pad they're not gonna filter for a type of brake pad and then every time they search for a break pad serve them it's different than the clothing business on the clothing side of this and the collection side that would be extremely extremely helpful so.
rep,absolutely now on the on the brake pad side we should open styling trucks and i can show you i'm styling trucks i've already told you i have this mercedes this year this model right so when i actually have provided those details i could either provide it through here where i can say you know what year make model that i have sub engine etc.
rep,and i can force the site to start giving me results based on that or i could even search for that same thing so i can search for say 2017 in mercedes s-class and it will and then whatever the sub engines might be i can then start getting recommendations based on what that particular model of car has so when i go and search for tires and will show me tires or specifically for that car that's a good example for us.
prospect,right so we the first time someone visits the site we're gonna ask them what year model and then what your model they have and then as they go through the categories they'll be filtering it by is a four wheel driver two wheel drive is it an amg or not an amg the first part of that the year on the model we will always remember what even without your engine that will be built in .
prospect,using standard cookies that will be done but the remembering of the filtering so as they go into the categories they don't have to keep clicking that is obviously a huge i use benefit first so okay i think i know enough about it at this point i think we should probably just given that at a time discussed what what pricing looks like because that's gonna be there yeah the biggest the biggest obstacle first at this stage of the game.
rep,absolutely so paul i know that you talk too much then you gonna find that the price is expensive what is the budget that you're looking at because already over budget.
prospect,i've already over budget for the project so you know you tell me what you guys typically typically charge and and and and see where we can go and you know with this project well it's a global pilot so what that means oh no one's there so this has been kicked off as a global pilot for daimler in germany so once the proof-of-concept is there for us in the canadian market and we prove it this site will be then duplicated for other markets so gaining us as a customer here in canada would then gain 50 other markets so so there's a lot of a lot of opportunity beyond just us in this site in the canadian market .
rep,so our pricing ranges from thousand dollars to twenty-five thousand dollars we work with hsn it's only five figure number there but this volume so today when you launch your site you're gonna have not that much volume your catalogue will be about 100000 skus so to somewhere it bases ice of 2002 .
prospect,so to start the catalogue will only be a couple hundred skus i within 12 within 12 to 24 months it may only be 5000 skus so it's gonna be a slow ramp up for us as we add products and you know we we may only do one order a week within the first six to twelve months so it's gonna be very very limited and i don't mind paying more as the volume is there but i need something that's affordable to get in the door when we have a low sku counts to then improve the value for later on so how do we get it down to the thousand dollars .
rep,so it's thousand these sort of the benchmark is there .
prospect,no but you that was the bottom end of your scale so of course i'm gonna go there .
rep,i just had to figure out so i get that and.
prospect,it's not a thousand dollars a month or it's out on anyway<>.
prospect,sorry you're breaking out pretty bad at he might be other ip phone. hello
rep,it's thousand a month .
prospect,okay which is again not terrible and then is there any additional fees on top of that like application.
rep,you can hear me now.
prospect,yeah i can hear you now you're breaking up pretty bad hello.
rep,i think there's a couple of seconds delay.
prospect,do you want to call me back maybe from a landline because it's uh i can't hear anything you're saying.
rep,what's your number paul that i could call you at and i can call you direct.
prospect,sorry
rep,hey paul i think i have your phone number. is there a number of .
rep,all right well i think we lost paul.
rep,monal you still on hello.
rep,yeah i'm here okay justin what's his number.
rep,yeah i'll just bring that the i think i have a signature once second okay i'm just bringing you a cell phone number here you go one sec.
rep,so you want to drop off from the presentation.
rep,okay oh sounds good thanks monal.
prospect,lunch sites but to support ab net dot com i'm primarily focused on the shop areas so the.
prospect,navigation insert pdp bumb cart you know any of any of the functional areas messaging all of that bother to me .
rep,okay that's that's great enough i do see that you use ibm websphare application so is it the default solar that you use for search today.
prospect,our searches based on solar.
rep,okay okay i thought so. generally they've seen customers move up with ibm that say you so let it default assume that would be a same up it okay.
prospect,we run about five million parts through our search don't were kind of forced into use somebody like inbecca who we used and then solar now the latest .
rep,okay okay that's that's good to know so you know i'm not sure how much you know about us so we are a bay area company we have headquartered here in mountain view pretty close to i know you're in san jose so not really fashion where you are so we've been around for the last seven years now we work with about 120 brands across the retail landscape our first few customers were in the fashion retail space because we talk about product discovery in personalization so there was a lot we could actually do with somebody who sells apparel and who sells anything to do with fashion cosmetics and so on and so forth so that was a mutual set of customers we worked with so express group anyone are some of the customers in the fashion retail space but then as the solution in the search system that we have itself is what matured we've started working with a lot of parts companies us auto parts out of la they roughly have about 2 million primary parts but if you look at all the combinations they probably have a database of about 184 million treatments that we essentially end up managing for them.
rep,work with iv supply again b2b supplier who primarily says to the government works with park parts warehouse join container on the b2b front and we also work with some home improvement companies we just signed up with home shopping network we work with bed bath & beyond we work with ashley furniture and in the apparel and brand space out of new york we've just started working with angela and love so some good diverse spectrum in e-tail that we primarily work with and from a platform standpoint most of our customers either come from an atg application background or some i-  the ibm garcia background but we also had customers who have a custom homegrown platform and the solution that we have built is actually completely platform agnostic so it doesn't matter what kind of application will actually use it about it.
rep,so this far i'll give you a quick background on what we do any questions on this so far.
prospect,no exactly.
rep,and from a solution perspective site search has been our core product that's something that we started the company with but today we also help you power your category pages we have a segment on target solution very similar to adobe segment and target and we have a product recommendation solution as well so essentially we have all the solutions that would cover the product discovery end-to-end right.
rep,one of the things that i tried doing today was to try to test avenet dot com primarily from a search use case standpoint i do understand there's a huge number of paths that you carry so just tested the site itself from a search landscape starting with the relevancy perspective then looked at the ui and when we when it comes to auto suggestion what kind of ui you actually build out then look at error correction synonym objection on the site and then briefly touched upon mobile but again it was the desktop and the search landscape on desktop is what a family spent my time on one one of the things i just wanted to understand i do understand you carry about five million power so when it comes to any kind of error tolerance of the site it could be spell checks it could be singular plural words or any other synonymous words is there an automation algorithm that you guys have built on solar or is it primarily a manual curated list of synonyms that good that you were closing on to the system .
prospect,yeah so i mean some of that we actually need probably somebody else that actually run some of the algorithm some of that some more stuff the technical side. i don't know that well.
rep,okay okay that's good thats good to know. so one of the while by like go through some of the differentiators with our solution i'll take you to as to why we have slightly different from a traditional search vendor but before that let me give you some of the quick notes on what i found on the site and i've shared its report with you and you can review that with your team as well.
rep,first i started looking some relevancy perspective one of the things which we tried doing here and when we were building our products other things you try doing differently there's most traditional systems including solar if you look at that background of all being primarily for document search not necessarily for an e-commerce product search and what we have tried doing with our relevancy the algorithms is to make the algorithm a little more ecommerce context aware and we've actually passed the algorithm with over 200 million products so that it actually understands when you look for the cells to point to 1997 vacuum cleaner in a parts industry versus a 2% on site dairy milk in a las colinas yes - what is the search string actually mean and how do you actually identify products in that search going so that slightly differently as we've actually approached building out the search platform itself . right so i found some common use cases from our relevancy perspective i started looking for motors on the side this is essentially your navigation page where it essentially gives me and guides me through what exactly i want to find within motors and this is how the search shows up right and then similarly i look for accent cabinets you obviously have this within your navigation section and producing a bunch of options to choose from in terms of manufacturers and type and model but again when i search for it it's probably not giving me any option all right then i'll start looking for some specific products on the site look for the surface mount amplifier you have about 700 odd products actually available on this site but from a search perspective probably what it's doing is it's either doing an ending or a or-ing or a minimal match so it's either returning too many products or too few products so from a search perspective it looks like it's a little bit broken overall then look for some non-rechargeable batteries you obviously have under batteries non-rechargeable ones more than 100 of them but again i searched further to the search box i don't find many there could be multiple ways why we the search is not showing these kinds of results a it could be there is probably only mortal number searches that actually happen on your site and you probably don't have feature based searches that actually keep keitan so that is something that foggy i can understand from you but i just tried three to four different variants within search just to this to see if there is an opportunity for us to work together.
rep,new series often has any one bought before we start you know i'll check with you.
prospect,i'm in actually not suggested specific i do have a <> often thing that i just going through but not specific one .
rep,okay okay and the second thing actually looks what is the auto suggestion itself there was there was two things i observed one is when i look for a product or the feature i actually have a guided auto feeder that actually comes up which is textual but then i've also seen when i start looking for a specific model number i do some imagery as well so that way it's pretty decent but what i also wanted to do was a understand from when people are actually buying products on your site i'm assuming that people don't come to buy just one single product they probably buy more than one product so i just wanted to share some layouts with you as to what we've tried doing for some of our customers and tommy you might find some of them helpful but overall some on auto suggest in the ui perspective i don't think there's a lot of issues on the side today then look for the current synonym detection and correction and and also how do you manage stem the words today like thermal management somebody could look for heat management obviously those synonyms in one case did not show me any results while thermal management actually showed me 32 results then i look for switch versus switches right one takes me directly to a navigation page but one actually gets me to a search results page which has way to many options which is because the intent of the customer is probably not changing too much by a switch or the switches but the experience is drastically different .
rep,then i misspelled micro controller more than misspelled i actually introduced the white space to be micro and controller it did not take me to the right results page so these were small little things that i found on the site and i understand with five million parts it could be a challenge managing with the solar infrastructure because if you have to manually go and correct everything for five million parts it is a completely non scalable solution one of the things that we have tried doing is essentially try and have resolved this in an algorithmic way where actually built in algorithms which could auto correct up to three words misspelled in a single search phrase and all these stemmed words that you would see single approving words introducing white spaces in between are all auto corrected so that you don't have to actually have a site ops team which constantly keeps looking at zero results and actually keep updating that money list or synonym because we understand that can be extremely time-consuming it's not productive and we have tried solving this and in a algorithmic way right.
rep,let me do this so just and i'll share this report with you with some of my findings but one of the things i wanted to do is actually take you to some websites and actually show you what we've tried doing and how you fight addressing some of the issues and i'll take you through some three four different examples just to give you some perspective of how we have solved it in each vertical starting with autosuggestion itself like if it's a fashion retailer the way we have tried doing this actually adding a lot more geo segments to what the user could be looking for if i want to go and look for sale something like jeans we want to guide the customer where you're looking for jeans for women jeans for men is it jeans of a specific style and then also introduce a colour segment where depending on the location that the user is coming in from actually show them jeans of a specific colour as well.
rep,so you've tried making it more visual and guided in a parallel space but in a grocery space where people actually buy a lot more products in every transaction we work with fresh direct here in new york basket is among the largest boxes in southeast asia for them the experience of build is if i want to add products to the cart since i buy a lot more products we have configured an auto suggestion window where actually people can change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box this primarily helps in user behaviours where people buy 25-30 products in a single transaction.
rep,and we've also added a personification layer where depending on a zip code they actually can through an office for a specific zip code right when it comes to parts when it comes to auto parts the suggestion we have built is essentially you can choose a model number for a retailer that you for a customer you want to work with and and for that car if you want to choose a specific part we have given an option where it's naturally change quantity and add products right through the search box.
rep,it's similarly for a parts manufacturer the window we have built in is either people come to the site either by a path or look by a model name one we've built them a navigation window where they can actually find any part in three clicks and then from search if i start looking for the cell the way bring this up this on one side you see pipes and one thing you see model names and then you also see cough so just for that specific model so that for a customer it's more visual and guided does this make sense to you.
rep,and and the intent here has seemed like different retailers have different buying will see different buying behaviours the way we have tried to customise this is to understand how people buy products on your site and customise a window where we can actually create a much better user experience for users right .
rep,and then when it comes to spelling mistakes this is what i was talking about like i could misspell say a black leather jacket as b-l-c-k-l-e-a-t-h-e-j-a-k-e-t like misspelling all the three words the way we have built our auto correction itself is where the system actually auto corrects its to black leather jacket and actually shows you results from the word go.
rep,so that you don't have to go and manually build a list of synonyms at the back end.
rep,right another thing that you've tried doing with i was talking to about natural language searches like things like say a dress on sale where probably a customer is looking for a specific product which is actually on sale we can actually read index key inventory and return all the results which are actually on sale right.
rep,and we can do even complex natural language queries where you can go and look for women top sighs then i know it's it might not be relevant in your use case but just wanted to show you the depth of the auto correction that we've actually built and sorry go and fetch women tops which are actually of size 10.
rep,so i think i misspelled so it will essentially build up everything for specific use case so these are all the natural language queries to build it.
rep,and and then even for parts then you have some partial part names the moment you start typing in a part number we actually have the ability to pull up from your inventory multiple pathways id supply has close to a million parts with the cell so you can essentially start rehashing the index and start showing which part the user might be looking at so either so that even from an auto suggestion itself they can go and click on a specific part they want to buy and go from that.
rep,so these are different use cases we try solving for the intent here is to reduce as much of manual effort that could be happening from your site and then try having the search system is just a lot more automated from an overall-experience standpoint.
rep,great so and one of the things that i also wanted to check with you was i know and i understand when it comes to search and product discovery it it's very intrinsic for every retailer your needs might be very very different from any other retailer we could have worked with so we also have a poc model what we generally do is we come and implement the solution generally in a four to six week window and then we actually lightly use the solution for six to eight weeks the intent here is to a for you to understand how the relevancy works in our system and what we also want to do is also show you a lift in conversions because if we have built a good search system it should possibly start impacting other ways for you.
rep,so we guarantee you at ten percent lift in search conversions within the first 60 days of going live and that is what you could actually see in a poc and if you actually see that lift in conversions then there is an roi for the investment you are doing on our product and then you can continue with the contract if you don't see the value you can walk away no questions asked.
rep,so if we make it non obligatory technically no cost kind of a model where you can actually test the solution which you eventually want to buy and the reason.
prospect,so we have specifically mobile.
rep,come again .
prospect,you'r talking specifically in mobile or you'r talking  across the board.
rep,we're talking across the board we have this poc model like these are just a few customer use cases we have like you could talk about and these are some of them are anywhere doing anywhere between 15 million to 500 million this is all these are all online revenues and this is the conversion rate up takes i've actually seen within the first 60 days of going live so and the reason is primarily because a we automate most of the tasks that are being done manually we bring in much higher relevancy to what the users are actually coming in from and with the entire auto suggest framework we create we're creating much better user interactions and much better ui so that people find it easier to find products on your site and eventually they'll probably end up buying more products.
rep,so that's the whole model that we've tried building and so that you get to see the results for yourself before you actually commit into a contract with any search query that in touch.
rep,so yeah this was like a quick high-level background i wanted to just present to you take your feedback i want to understand like are you looking at evaluating somebody does this model make sense to you would you be interested in doing a poc just thought i'll check with you on next steps and then take it from there.
prospect,sure if you don't mind send this to me will great i can talk there people in certain team what they're currently doing i've not seen certain road map frankly a year out.
prospect,and let me down down the pipeline no i'm happy to you know pass on the information and if sometimes there's different types of stuff that i just don't know thank you.
prospect,no this will not the latest roadmap and seeing if anyone liked it sophia matson for assets we're fairly large infrastructure so anytime you touch anything like this it needs a lot of prioritisation to get get on the board.
rep,toatally understand that.
prospect,i'm sure you've to get that.
rep,we've gone to other species after that apiece in the last year so we totally understand how things would work that's why we tried and structure of poc non-intrusive model we generally don't even do an api integration which involves too much of ip involvement we sometimes do a poc with an in page ajax model where all you give us is a header footer we print all the search results just for you to check from a relevancy perspective or we can also do like an offline test where you probably go do and go live we put everything on a staging environment and your team can do a bunch of use cases to test on relevancy even before we go live we try making.
prospect,okay <>
rep,no no we try doing these offline models just to make sure that it's at least easier to show some value because what we've realised this search as a solution can't be solve with the presentation so we have tried to make ways and means easier for people to test us before they decide to take it internally and then come up with either an rsp or coming up with a solution proposal as such so that's why we have this poc model in place so that it becomes easier for people to test it .
prospect,sounds good
rep,okay so yeah thank you so much again for your time so we will send across this information will it be okay to check back with you in 2-3 weeks just to see if there's any update at all.
prospect,yes that's fine.
rep,okay sure then thank you so much again wonderful talking to you have a good evening.
prospect,all right thank you guys bye .
prospect,to protect their time i'm gonna take i'm gonna take this one i know that this event is at some point came through the gm and vp of e-commerce here i think they may have received an email from you guys and because some interest i guess at least to the want at least have this discussion and share with us what you have prepared and you know perhaps we can just take some next steps after that so.
rep,no problem at all justin you might wanna just share the screen with me.
rep,sure one second here.
rep,and just just a quick curious question do you use adobe today for site search or is it all custom built .
prospect,so we do use adobe that's primarily orem for our content management delivery but we do have inbecka currently for our search.
rep,ah okay that's good to know so well actually i know we just have 30 minutes today so let me quickly take you through what we've prepared and then we can obviously schedule some follow-up discussions to talk further based on your availability.
rep,so what i wanted to ideally do today was to give you a quick background about us and also take you through that report we prepared for you and also understand currently any specific challenges you face today from a site search other product discovery perspective and are there opportunities for us to work together so better is finally in ted today right.
rep,just to get started we are a bay area company and i hope you can see my screen.
rep,a behavior campaign we work with about 120 larger grants primarily in the retail space we power over to 1200 mobile sites we've seen a maximum success and largest chunk of customers are in the fashion retail space we to express we work with 321 we just started working with ann taylor and loft on the home improvement space we probably have the two biggest names we work with ashley furniture the largest furniture store in the us and bed bath and beyond in the electronics and hardware space we work with latex gregg's we work with us other parts we work with id supply up and basically new york we work with prosthetic as well so fairly well-rounded solution one thing you might notice you know a lot of names that you see here are mostly customers who were using inbecka so either we coexist with inbecka just solving for search challenges and there have been instances where it essentially replaced and inbecka to manage both search category pages and merchandising. so the solution we've built can be a light - like replacement for inbecka that at the same time there could be a lot more dependencies on inbecka especially the merchandising team will be probably working on inbecka a couple last 10 years they don't want to change anything right now in such cases we only replace the search part of inbecka the because that is the core of our product the whole relevancy and the algorithm we've built on relevancy is something that differentiates us for most of the other vendors out there in the market.
rep,so in the solution is platform agnostic you could be on atg you could be on websphere it could be an hype search it could be in a completely homegrown custom platform the solution is built to be completely platform agnostic.
rep,then as i told you we cover the whole gamut when it comes to product discovery site search is what we started with but we also do category navigation we help you power your product recommendations all the widgets you would see on amazon essentially we built all of that and that could be used as of widget strategy as to what widget you want to use in which section of the site and we have a segment on target tool very similar to adobe segment and target.
rep,but the strength here is since we manage search and category pages segmentation logic is much more stronger that way.
rep,we can do all kinds of segmentation and one is to and personalization i'll probably show you a quick video towards the end of this 30 minutes just so that you get some context on the segmentation we're talking about.
rep,so yes that's a high level background of who we are and what we do any questions on this so far.
prospect,no nothing so far a chance to look at the website you know just prior to the call so i think i've got a good pulse on offering.
rep,okay that's thank you and what we did from customer experience support perspective what we tried doing is we tried mimicking the customer behaviour especially to find products on your site from a search experience perspective so we capture the client capture the entire experience site from the autofill functionality your current relevancy strengths looking at how do you respond to stemmed words how do respond to error correction and then how you're faceting the structure today is it static isn't dynamic and then how do we work on mobile devices .
rep,so finally from a search landscape trying to cover the entire gamut i'll email this document to you after this call of the share this along
rep,and before we get started right so the first concept of what is clyde bringing onto the market is this entire understanding of context your search so what we've tried to do is why we built a platform we've also driven the platform and passed it through over 200 million products so that it gets a much more ecommerce context awareness .
rep,so the platform today can understand if you were to look for something like black leather jacket in the apparel space that the platform could understand that okay jacket was the product leather is the fabric attribute black is the color attribute .
rep,why whereas someone comes in looks for 2% nonfat dairy milk in the grocery world what does this natural language query actually means.
rep,so it's essentially built on the strength of this context awareness and we believe it's very important today because more search system including inbecka today having really gonna old search logic of using the tf-idf algorithm which will google users to some extent the limitation of that algorithm is that was actually built for document search so it essentially ranks products based on the popularity of arity.
rep,but it does not add the entire ecommerce awareness into it the problem here is i'll give you a quick use case say if you have to find say women's white jeans the way at tf-idf algorithm which most systems use today the way it ranks it is it gives the highest weight-age to white then to women and then to jeans because white is the rarest and jeans system is fairest but from an e-commerce context actually jeans is most relevant then it's women and then it's white i am just giving you a quick simple example.
prospect,mm-hmm.
rep,this is what we've tried to trim our algorithm into so that starts understanding the nuances of how products has to be found on an e-commerce site and that's how we drive relevancy and one overall other things that we've done is we started off as a project for target.com they had an innovation on where the 103 commerce company or technology companies who build stuff for e-commerce in the retail space unbxd was started as a project until 2009 will be initially stride solving relevancy for target dot com and then from 2010 we'll be in an independent company .
rep,so one of the key things we tried doing there was also try it try to understand what kind of search behaviour you actually see in detail to them and if you actually look at it more closely there are essentially 12 ways people look for information right if you're in your case being a store which sells a lot of computer accessories and everything to do with electronics people might use a lot of linguistic shortcuts like put 40 inch television the word inch can be replaced by double quotes right people might use a lot of natural language searches where they might say something adaptor under $50 or an iphone cable under $25 right or in the apparel space people use a lot of chromatic words where people might be looking for an evening dress or a cocktail dress where as in a lot of b2b use cases people might be searching by a partial sku match right .
rep,so what we've done is apart from this adding the e-commerce context awareness to our algorithm we've also built algorithms which would solve for each of these queries out of the box hence the project name was called unbxd initially and eventually became the name of the company.
rep,so this is essentially how we have tried solving for element say the start will be the background any questions on this.
prospect,nah not at this time no thank you.
rep,and i'm sorry for the long explanationt .
prospect,thats ok.
rep,<> context aside.
rep,right so now coming to what we found and see there become today right so i wouldn't look for a paper shredder obviously you have this product on your site right but when i search for this product it's probably doing an anding or or-ing so it's showing me something to do with paper but it is not understanding the word shredder right so that's where it generally gets broken right now also why it was actually doing some research also found something on your site where say if i feel like i look for red hat cloud forums i just search it in a different way in a more natural language way i don't find anything but if you actually go to your site red hat cloud forums is one of your popular listings actually on the home page it you actually have something for red hat cloud forum it's one of your featured products but i look for cloud forum s red hat it essentially breaks the whole thing i add a white space in between for cloud space forums that usually breaks it right then i try looking for something slightly more specific on the site i look for p ti-84 calculator this is where it actually picks up because this entire word is actually present on these face so it actually performs the right result so it shows me the right things that i want to see maybe and then i look for certain natural language queries i look for a notebook under $500 you obviously have notebooks under $500 on the site when i do functionality but it does not bring it up and search right then i look for a chromebook of a specific color you obviously have chromebooks which have white and color but when i search for it it takes me to something extremely different right.
rep,so these were specific use cases i was talking to you about where you actually have the product available in your inventory i can reach that product through your brows function on the site but when i search for it we don't find it right is this problem not solvable no absolutely not this problem but it requires a lot of manual effort to do it right .
rep,what we've tried doing is trying to automate all of this so that you don't have to go and look at your zero results every time and start creating roules for it on inbecka whereas trying to solve for this automatically and i'll show you some use cases that we have solved for also after this but to get some context into this right .
rep,now i look for your autosuggestion we are autofill uses your first experience with your customers will have it your brand this was where i found some very good things you have a guided auto suggest you guide me through with specific suggestions and you also show me products which is what most retailers do today so this was a good thing and also show you some of use cases you've built probably if there is something that you could take back from a design perspective or from a ui perspective you can incorporate those this way right.
rep,then look at some synonym detection like the portable hard drive right like people do use the word hdd which is fairly common but if i look for portable hdd versus portable hard drive the results you actually see is drastically different in one section i see about thirty eight results but if i expand the word hard drive actually see over 200 results right .
rep,here the intent of the customer is not changing so technically you should still show him or her the same set of results and again the way to solve this and inbecka is to create a manual synonym rule and we try and automate that functionality for you so that you don't have to create this rules because it's not a scalable solution for you .
rep,this is making sense jack.
rep,it is and you know we're certainly aware of some of some of this and we realize there's also some data you know challenges that we have today so coupled with data versus you know the taxonomy and the way in which you know things are classified it's for on-site search those are those are some things that are currently in process so i think this is a good one now in terms of just losing out on visibility and there was there is a products just because the word isn't spelled out .
rep,hello
prospect,yeah i'm here yeah.
rep,hey sorry that my i think i just got disconnected for a second.
rep,so yeah so i get that i get the context of one of the key things that you mentioned was also the data issue right so one of the things we have tried solving for data because a lot of retailers we also work with have actually a huge number of skus and they also have skus that change differently especially in the auto space we work with this customer call us auto a specific product could be named differently two years ago but today it is named something else but a customer who's bought something on their site some time back might probably remember that specific way to look for that product and he or she might search for it in that context and today the data might have changed so that's why what we generally also do is when we drive relevancy we just don't look at the title of the product itself we look at the title we look at the entire pdp description and we also look at reviews so that we are a lot more comprehensive in showing up relevancy it didn't also a lot of jobs that we'll have to do at our end that's why we have built this hadoop system which can actually accentuate all this data in real time but we believe by doing that our relevancy is much more stronger overall .
rep,so ended up quick check on some again violence out the specific configuration i found the same results then tried doing some spelling mistakes this is what was corrected but it but i do see some use cases where it was not corrected so it's again manual versus actually finding out automatically so these are some overall use cases i saw what i'll do is i'll i know we've probably fifteen minutes left so i would also do is i'll email you this report you could also review them but what i wanted to quickly show you was some very specific use cases that we have solved for so if you get some context on how we are trying to solve for it.
rep,right and i'll take a few examples of a few different retailers of different because so that you get some breadth of customisation we work with
rep,if you take an example of express they wrapped it over three hundred million dollars one nine but they're a fashion retailer with a strong store presence as well so what they wanted to build as an experience was to give the users a similar experience they get in the store where they go into a specific i look at a specific category then select a specific product right.
rep,this entire functionality for them is when you start looking for a specific product in this case could be say jeans this maximises screen what we have done is we have made it both guided and visual where it if you're looking for jeans is it for women is it for men as it is it for a specific style and as you keep hovering around the actual results keep changing and then we added a segmentation block here where depending on the location that the user is coming in from in style in a parallel changes for location it actually depending on the location that you are you're coming in from it will actually show you products of that specific location which is most popular and then we also show the top keywords and.
prospect,so this is that's changing our hover then not on a quick tour anything .
rep,correct its just changing on hover.
rep,right and then we also tried making it smarter i now start looking for dress express catalogue does not have does not have actually dress for men so it does not even show men as an option right and i move it to red shirt this is available for men so it will show men as an option so this way it automatically keeps changing right .
rep,and you've done some specific functionality with different retailers like if i go to apparel we work with first direct in new york and we also work with this large aggressive in southeast asia called big basket for them the use case was they actually have custom must buy 35 to 40 products in every transaction so they wanted a quick add to cart option because to effectively by 40 products you have to go through over 3 and 150 clicks so the way we configured the auto suggestion for them is the moment i start typing in chicken you actually have an auto suggestion box where you can actually add products to cut and then depending on the zip code you are coming in from we can show you an off go for the specific zip code then we can do commonly search popular brands and categories that it's more easier to buy 40 products this way and add to go to so many pvp pages to buy those products.
prospect,but from a consumer perspective do you do you know already that you want to make that buying decision from the search where you don't need product detail and other things at this point like.
rep,on the vertical jeff so in grocery especially for a repeat user i generally buy egg milk and chicken in every grocery run so for my repeat users they've configured this right but again it depends on how you want different people configure it different way i show you showed you in express right the template we've built is very different than what we've built for say a big basket.
rep,or if it's a very exploratory buy for say somebody like an ashley i am just looking for a so far i'm not even sure if i want to buy it or not so for them we have configured something definitely but you probably have popular products and you have a segmentation like something that you've built right so again we can customise it for a retailer depending on the retail in this requires.
rep,another thing that i wanted to show is all these spell checks and relevancy that i showed you that was not working on the site so what what we've tried doing this since the engine is context-aware we want to auto correct most of these aspects instead of depending on your team to correct it manually so that we reduce the effort in your team like say the word but black leather jacket if i misspelled all the three words i could say b-l-c-k-l-e-t-h-r-j-a-k-t misspelled all the three words incorrectly one of the key things we do is one way with auto corrected if it's misspelled and we'll show you results from the word code and you don't have to do this manually.
rep,right another thing that we solve for is all these stem challenges stem the word challenge right simple things like similar plural or way you look for a product that's searching like i could look for t-shirt as t space shirt right you show me a bunch of results probably about 560 of them somebody i else might just look for t-shirts as t's right the intent of the customer is not changing so the number of results you show them should actually be the same .
rep,right again these are things that you solve manually in inbecka be trying to automate those functionalities right and then finally on relevancy people today just don't look for a single word query today the behavior of customers have changed drastically where they'rel where we see a lot more intent driven search query so you actually see more of two word and three word queries typed up so things we solve for us like things like dress on sale right.
rep,a you should be able to pick up from the data available from your inventory all the dresses and you should also show me all the dresses which are actually on sale and your child should and should also work in the long pay as well right and then when i go and look for things like dress on clearance and i misspelled the word clearance it should say autocorrect sell to clearance and also show me the results from the word pro.
rep,right so it should be more clear that way and then it also solve for things like say if i look for returns on the site right it should automatically take me to that specific landing page where you have stored policies and returns and not make me go and find it it should redirect me to this page or even if i have to found a store i'm in new york today if i want to find a store near me right it should take me to that section where it's showing me all the stores to near all right .
rep,so this way we are trying to understand the context of what the user might be looking for and drive relevancy accordingly.
rep,and then finally to manage all this we actually have a dashboard essentially because how much ever ai logic we build in ultimately we understand the market doesn't merchandise and i just know the business best so you also have to enable them with tools to work on so we have a fairly comprehensive dashboard for search for category pages and for recommendations there's like a high level view of the dashboard you have comprehensive reporting we can manage specific users the way you want .
rep,and in terms of core merchandise thing let me just show you a quick video in terms of the capability available you can actually go and create a campaign you can create a custom landing page you can create a vanity url and when you go and create a campaign you can actually go and define like you might be doing today's specific start dates and end dates for the campaign so that you can plan for campaigns accordingly and once you choose a campaign we also let you define an audience this is where our entire segmentation logic comes in today you can go and say for all my new visitors coming in from a tablet coming in from a specific zip code coming in from a specific channel i want to create a specific set of campaigns so the same category should show differently for somebody coming in from desktop vs laptop versus mobile so you can are from a specific channel like we let you they give you the ability you to start the finding audiences right and we believe this can be important because we've seen real-time data where somebody coming in from an email channel converts 4 x more than somebody coming in from a social channel right somebody coming in from a google ppc campaign has a 30% more or the average order value from somebody coming from a social app.
rep,so when the behaviour is so different in each channel why do you want to show them the same set of products and we've given you a tool where you can actually create it's such segments in a more defined way right.
rep,and once you create a segment if marketers have conflicting ideas and they want to do an a/b test and decide the winner on the highest number of clicks or add to cart so conversions we've also added the a/b test logic where you can actually go and do a quick a/b test as well right.
rep,and then you can do all the core merchandising functions you can boost you can salt you can slot you can pin you can manage all the functions automatically and your preview section lets you see all the changes and it's more 2017 system you drag and drop you pin products the ui is mostly cut so it's more easier to manage merchandising that okay.
prospect,hmm so i understand you asked in regards to adobe so you know certainly there's suite of tools offers targeted campaign audience you one of these competitors than one adobe offers at this point because some of this is very reflective of what i've seen with their dashboard capabilities as well.
rep,absolutely so with that category navigation section we definitely compete with adobe because if you look at product discovery landscape right you've three to four key elements like today you might be using inbecka for search somebody else so category navigation adobe for segment target and somebody else is merchandising we offer one single solution that put him encompass all your needs as a retailer and one thing we do differently which stands out is i could show you the most flashiest of presentation i use cases but your business might be very unique we have a poc model where we can come in and implement our solution and let you use the solution for four to eight weeks and in that window we guarantee you an a ten percent lift in conversions you don't see the lift you can walk away no questions asked but if you see the lift you can then enter into a contract so that you test our product before you actually buy it and we're sticking our neck out on the contract guaranteeing your ten percent lift in conversions.
rep,so yeah i know it was a lot of information overload but i just want to cover all the aspects in a 30 minute window and also take your feedback on.
prospect,yeah no i think that i think that's great it's always just raises you know raises some of that point with what you've observed what we would be able to benefit from you know there are aspects of adobe we have not yet made investments and certainly from an am perspective sites and assets we've got optimiser and a couple other things but right now we're leveraging some other third-party tools for some personification for a/b testing and you know writing some of that out at this point so in terms of you know it's the me dive consideration or an investment i just don't see anything happening at this point you know or at least in 2017 perhaps there's you know re-evaluation and you know if we're planning for 2018 and years ahead but you know i think that you know between data and the way in which we've got to provide more context you know for the users you know some of the stuff you services is things that i think most of the teams certainly are on-site search team is aware of and we're looking to calibrate you know things accordingly and then also get get the best out of it inbecka you know considering you know that's right now the the investment.
prospect,in terms of course capabilities but now i mean i think it's been been great to just see some of the the right to the point you know with the use cases and some of the things you have observed on our website for sure.
rep,and do let us know jeff as it will do we have a poc model anytime this year if you see there is a window of opportunity to calibrate yourself with what you're doing with inbecka and what we could bring add additional to the table purely just from a search perspective do let us know we are happy to get into an a/b test with inbecka and sure  if it can be any better than then and this will probably have us as a part of a 2018 plan as such.
rep,yeah i mean i don't know i mean there has been some discussions you know do we do we consider alternatives for what has been a inbecka for the last several years or you know do we continue to re-up and and go from there so i just think that just getting some visibility and having the discussion certainly yeah at least was what's that in the higher log in terms of what you guys you know can do and you know is there other considerations other than what we've been going with so i think from that perspective it's been good.
prospect,okay thank you so much though.
prospect,so yeah yeah is there an opportunity than just to you know you got some of the contextual you know use case is there is there a way that i could just begin to get that get a few of those samples they have in my site pocket as i socialize with be here.
rep,yeah i want to also go back with john to i know he was the one that kind of pointed us in in this direction you know when he introduced me to you guys via the email so i'm sure i'll want to follow up but yeah that's having that part of would help you know what i do reconnect with him and just follow up so that's great.
rep,sure no problem sir thank you so much again for your time and look for to follow up with you again.
prospect,very good thanks guys.
rep,and then meeting on the bridge.
prospect,perfect and i just wanted to let you know - we only have until 2:30 we don't actually have a full hour so if you could you know just bubble up some of your key insight we would greatly appreciate that and then we have an hour to 2:30.
rep,sure i will quickly share my screen and walk you through few of the elements we have found on the site and before i get started a few quick pointers.
rep,so can let me understand what's the e-commerce platform that you're using today.
prospect,it's a homegrown system on dot net.
rep,okay awesome and how about site search is that something you built internally or do you use.
prospect,google search appliance.
prospect,google search appliance okay awesome great and also how many products do you have on the site.
prospect,oh about say around 20000 products.
rep,thank you so i had a longer agenda but i'll try and keep it short wanted to talk a little about us i've done a quick research on your site and i will show you a few examples where we see an opportunity for you to improve the overall product discovery experience for a customer and enhance the conversions and then if time permits i can show you how we solve this today and can answer any other questions you might have is that okay for you.
rep,cool sounds good so to quickly talk about us we are a six-year-old company headquarters in sunnyvale california with offices in chicago back in india we have more than 1200 sites that we power globally 120 us customers and brands that we cater to right here in the us we serve over 1 point 5 billion interactions a month which is larger than the top three e-commerce retailers in the us put together right here are some prestigious customers that we work with today and you see there are from various different verticals right so that shows that what we are providing today is not a cookie cutter solution something that fits any size company from any vertical right express rue 21 the apparel giants or maybe ashley furniture store the largest online furniture store in the us right from platform perspective it's a platform agnostic solution works on any e-commerce platform either homegrown on a dot net platform or gartner platform or any other e-commerce platform any any questions you have.
prospect,not for now thank you.
rep,okay awesome.
rep,here is a quick enough quote from the express ceo ninety days after we went live we could show a great impact or increase in their conversion i cannot quote the numbers but this was huge enough for him to go and quote us during his q2 earnings call right this was a double-digit increase in conversions that we could deliver within the 90 days for express.
rep,here is a experience bluejeans before and after and we do this with our solution primarily elements being machine learning personalization and contextual search and i'll relate some of these elements with your site today with few examples from your site today and i'll show you those some numbers and i'm trying to be quick here to cover as much as i can on this call but but if you think i'm fast just please feel free to pause me or stop me and i'm more than happy to slow down.
prospect,no you're perfect thank you for being quick we appreciate it.
rep,awesome here are some statistics from our customers today conversion rate increase and the revenue increase anywhere between say 11 percent to 60 percent increase in conversion and same thing with revenue right anywhere between 10 percent to almost 120 percent conversion revenue increase within 90 days right and then post that it only increases because the solution comes with machine learning meaning the more time it spends on your website it only gets better right so it's not something that you have achieved in 90 days will not be improved over a period of time so the the examples that i've taken from your site and this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end this is just for us to show you the areas of opportunity on your website today and examples taken are will be around these areas right autosuggest the first interaction that the customer makes on the site error tolerance or auto correction right handling spell checks stemming synonymous words then the most important part of search being relevancy right how relevant the results are for any kind of search where the search ui elements few of the ui elements that i'll walk you through merchandising dashboard the back end merchandising dashboard this is more on our side and then the current infrastructure right in terms of site speed and how fast the page loads etc so the first thing that i looked at on your site was the autosuggest right this is the first interaction that the customer is making and it's important that we start exposing the the the right products the right set of products right that the customer is more likely to buy i feel that you have a very standard autosuggest it's good that you have visual after suggest a lot of sites are missing that today but this can be taken to the to a next level and i can i can show you few examples but in this case say if i was i was typing in brown brown actually doesn't mean anything the first suggestion you see that matches with my search query right brown has to be linked to a particular category of products a particular subset of products right also the popular products sort of this this is hard coded or changes in real time and how real time this is and it's not guiding me to any category this way right could be say lamps you have various different categories wood can again fall into various different categories there could be wooden tables wooden chairs wooden sofas right it could be various different things and you can start guiding the customers in the into the right categories and let me show you a few examples here i make sure you guys can see my screen so do you see the us patriot tactical site.
rep,okay awesome us patriot tactical they are a thirty five million dollar company based out of texas they sell the military apparel to citizens for them brands and some of the categories of these brands is very important right and here is what we have built for them the moment i start typing ni it starts showing me nike as the most popular brand some of the categories within nike so the other brands that i would have probably not looked at nite ize night vision nine line apparel and their popular brands sorry categories some of the top queries starting with ni on right hand side it starts showing you some of the popular products and last week when i was doing this demo the black boot here was actually on the fourth position so that's how dynamic it is right there's it incorporates machine learning and popularity based on what people are viewing clicking for a particular search query those products automatically start posting up here is another example from express as a brand for them categories was very important and this is what we did for them the moment i start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories and when i browse through these each category starts showing some other popular products for each individual category let me show you ashley furniture home store they wanted a simple window as far as i remember right they have some popular products here now the sofas some of the popular sofa queries that they have here right and the last one that i wanted to show was big basket dot com they are the second largest grocery retailer in <> i know this is not from your vertical but i wanted to show the breadth of customization of this particular piece which is autosuggest right big basket dot com 2 challenges that we solved for them a they had visitors who used to be the visitors used to buying similar products in each grocery run and they used to buy 15 to 20 products in each transaction which used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to search the product go to the product page add to cart and then check out and to solve that we built something like that this the moment i start typing in chicken start showing all the options for chicken the prices quantity allows me to increase quantity and add to cart right here from search box on right hand side it starts showing me some of the commonly searched terms for chicken popular brands popular categories allows you to put a banner to promote any particular product for a particular cat search query not just that also act with personalization to it because they have repeat customers so if i was buying anytime chicken boneless more often then i would see this on top but if you were buying masala chicken more often on the side and you would start seeing masala chicken on top so all these examples you see there from different verticals and every customer had a different challenge right so once we onboard a customer we understand the user behavior how people are buying on your site how do they search for products on your site and then we come up with some of these customed designs which would be most appropriate for your site right and we obviously take your feedback as well because you would know your business best but the idea is that something that works for ashley might not work for you something that works for you might not work for express right so for each site the experience has to be different because the buying behavior of the customers on each site is different.
rep,any questions before i move ahead.
prospect,no sounds good so far.
rep,does this rezena is is this something that you you feel there could be an opportunity for you.
prospect,possibly.
rep,so this is the first interaction right someone looking for for products and you start guiding them from there very first few letters that they start type in but then post that or if you look at is the relevancy with regards to the way these different elements the first thing i looked at on your site was the error tolerance people tend to make a lot of spelling mistakes when they come from smaller screen tablets or even a laptop when we tend to type fast right people tend to make some mistakes and i try to i've assisted at the same behavior to see how relevant the results were and if the site was able to automatically correct and show me the right set of answers right so i misspelled mirrors with a single r it gave me zero results then i misspelled chandeliers and again it gave me zero results right with us what we have done is and and traditionally the way this is this is being solved is the the search companies expect you to create huge libraries go look at what are the most misspelled queries and create redirects or use libraries at the back end but we automate this experience we have built a solution that can automatically correct 85 to 90% of misspelled queries on any site right and and a search query of up to six word with one sorry two alphabets misspelled in each word can be automatically corrected by unbxd right here is an example from express black leather jacket all three misspelled with one alphabet missing not not only automatically corrected but we immediately start showing the relevant results for this query.
rep,how do you solve spell checks today do you create libraries or is it is it completely the default google engine that solves the misspelled words.
prospect,no it's something that we need to put more focus on right now or it's not something we're looking at on a daily basis so you know i think what you're bringing to light is something that's important.
rep,completely understand that it's always a lot of manual effort to do some of these things without a solution like unbxd then i look at some of the stemmed words right again stemming words could be singular plural say man men game gaming center central some of these words where the intent of the customer doesn't change irrespective of how they are trying to search for products so i tried chaise versus chaises i tried to fool it but it was still showing me this products but again the order of these products was totally different the count of product right chase showed me 33 results but chaises showed me 173 results that means the search results still have some non relevant set of products right then i look for color synonym.
rep,do you see a lot of people finding products using colors.
prospect,ah yeah i think so.
rep,okay so i tried say black sofa versus charcoal sofa totally different set of results with us what we have also built in built is a color synonym corpus let's say typically works really well in apparel because that's where people are very particular about the colors right so say i go on to a site and look for a crimson dress just because that's the theme of the party or that's the i i need it i have crimson shoe and i need a crimson dress the system is automatically able to understand that crimson belongs to the red color family so if you have a crimson product we immediately start showing crimson product but if you do not have a crimson product we understand let's say red ruby garnet marlow these are colors which are more closer to crimson and we start boosting those products on top instead of showing them other black or gray or brown color products here is a stemming example from express you'll see t-shirt t-shirts t-shirts with - without - or even a slang for t-shirt which is tees it automatically corrects it starts showing same set of results right in all these cases you would have noticed 424 results but for the query however the customer tries to search and and this is what makes the experience great on the site and enhance increase in conversions then i looked at the site search speed right how fast the pages were loading and i notice that that the at times the page load speeds were slow almost 200% slower than the 300 millisecond industry-standard something that has been set by google according to google anything you know lesser than 300 milliseconds is something that is not observable by the human eye and that's where this whole standard comes up but when i test that on your site looks like the west coast seems to be the slowest but even the others remain more than 300 milliseconds here is a snapshot we took from express site one of our engineer did that actually for the sales team this this was done on black friday one of their most busiest day and you'll notice all there across regions right it remains below 300 milliseconds then we work on a very tight sla this is part of the contract that that the the search speed or the page load speeds would remain less than 300 milliseconds anything beyond that you would start penalizing ourselves then i looked at relevancy and before i get into relevancy right it's important to understand the behavior of how people are searching on any site right and that's what we did before we started unbxd the founders spent quite some time doing research on two things a large catalogs how they were configured b how people are searching online today be it on google of be it on say amazon right how people are searching in general and we classified the search queries into 12 different types and there is a there's a white paper fitted with payment on these twelve types of queries so to give an example say exact search could be the exact product name model number screen number i am looking for feature search could be red dresses the red is the feature of the product dress party dress where party becomes the theme of a product dress could be a slang or an abbreviation wherein on an electronic site i start looking for a 55 inch tv and instead of inch i put double quotes out there natural language query christmas gifts for toddlers there is no product mentioned but because today google and amazon is able to understand this the the users or the customers believe that every site can understand these kind of queries and then and sometimes they just copy-paste this from google and copy it from google and paste it on on an e-commerce site expecting them to start showing relevant results and if you are not able to understand it and start showing the relevant they will just leave the site believing that you do not carry these products so we built a system that was again able to understand 85 to 90 percent of all these dwell types of queries and start showing relevant results here are a few examples of that i took from your site exact search and i look for brown sofa the third product you see here is not a sofa some sort of table then i look for queen-size beds again got zero results you have lots of beds i'm sure some of them are also queen-size beds but again zero results that that return then i look for some of product type search as look for live wood table i'm a big fan of live wood tables by the way or live wood furnitures so it was good to see that you have a huge collection for live wood tables i when i click when i do this on google you come on top and when i click on it this is the page on the right hand side and that it takes me to right the live wood table i'm sorry it's the other way around so when i am on google it actually is taking me to a wrong page right but when i search for it it still takes me to the right page the live wood table page here are a few examples from express say blue straight leg slim fit jeans if you are able to solve a query of up to 5 to 6 words right and start showing them the relevant results brown loveseat with cupholder such a complex query on on ashley this is a screenshot from ashley and we were able to solve that and start showing relevant results for them then i look for some feature search some of the products some of the office chairs that i was looking at did have contemporary in the description right and if i'm not wrong people at times do come and look for this kind of terms right contemporary furniture so i tried to do that for office chair zero results i look for bright table lamps right now bright is something which becomes a feature of a product you might not have that in description but then this it's it's still necessary to understand that the customer is primary looking for table lamps and if you have any terms that does classify a table lamp into a brighter one than the other then the system should also be able to understand that and start throwing those out posting those products on top.
rep,there are some examples full sleeve office wear for women or say black v-neck for women right those are the kind of complex queries that we're solving for express.
rep,then i look for some of the non product search like shipping policy return policy store locations a lot of lot of people come in search for these in search bar i think that the site would be able to also show me results for this and and on the other side again i was not able to get relevant results here are a few examples in terms of how we can also handle non product searches it could also be some of your blogs and articles that we can start reading and start making them searchable if you have traffic coming for those kind of content on your site. compatibility search lamps for desk versus a desk lamps right different set of results again in different order different number of results here you see only two results when i look for lamps for desk but desk lamps and you actually have twenty three products that should have come up again another example from express tops for jeans we are again able to solve that theme based search right look for durable chairs again becomes a theme of the product or say best sofa i mean something the customer might want to come and look at your best products a top-selling products right and these are the kind of terms that they might use but the results that return are more round tables and not sofa and similarly expensive suit for men it nowhere says that a suit is expensive but we are able to understand that a customer is looking for high-priced products and start boosting them winter jackets right no one says winter jackets but because of geolocation and because of the description we would be able to boost some of the products so people coming from new york from a colder region right would be say looking at a particular set of products more often so those products automatically gets boosted up because of the seasonality there and two here you see some where it says wool which the system is again able to understand and that this is more of a winter material and start boosting that on top. natural language queries most difficult to solve most important to solve because the percentage of these queries might be lower on your site but the conversion rates could be 60 to 70% higher and and that's what the typical research also says because the customers are are pretty much very clear in terms of what they are looking and they are maybe coming from some other site copy-pasting terms coming from google and putting that on your site and trying to find something furniture on sale writing desks under $ 2000 i'm very specific i want writing desks which are lesser than 2000 dollars again 0-0 results dress on sale we were able to understand someone's looking from dresses which are on sale blue dresses rather which are on sale and start showing those products head query search lighting here are some of the various different you know options that you guide people when they are navigating for lighting could be wall and ceiling could be lamps lighting accessories but when i search for lighting the experience is not same like randomly its showing me some sort of lights which are may be you know not something that i'm looking at and that's where we make this experience a little different so i'll show you an example right so mobile on an electronic site the intent of the customer is yet not clear whether they are looking for mobiles mobile headphones with the lighting we covered same thing in your case right the intent of the customer wasn't clear what exactly do they want in the lighting and we have the technology to identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance of popularity but we start we still start showing products for the most popular category that will be mobile here now over a period of time if mobile cases and covers became more popular then mobile cases and covers will come on position two and headphones become a position three.
rep,one quick question where are you located.
prospect,we're in cleveland ohio.
prospect,okay i could probably do something on friday.
rep,what time is best.
prospect,about 10 o'clock.
prospect,or you can make it 10:30.
prospect,10:30 about half an hour.
prospect,okay super and if you could send me if you could send me this document meantime i'd like to i'd like to respond with some q&a so that you you don't have to do all the talk.
prospect,wonderful sounds like a good plan thank you so much i appreciate your time.
rep,great thank you kim.
rep,we give give people <> do specifics out and 65% of them search for it about 35% of them use the navigation one instant observation was okay while the instant observation that we found and just a one second i'm just hearing  okay so one instant observation was when they started typing women there was no autocomplete or type-ahead with so that is something that <<>> if someone chooses <> but like a good boy or a good girl tries time you might want to in better that experience by showing certain autocomplete that is something it is good to have that the users is in <> we gave them some something because more generic for your site's we asked them to look for waterproof shoes you are about 50% 50% of them use the navigation and category pages to get.
prospect,i am here.
rep,okay so in task 3 we asked people to find whatever they want to find on the site this most of them i think my task 3 were more more familiar with your site probably a few products that caught your attention so they chose the navigation section to go and find for what they wanted right.
rep,and then when it comes to a product selection stage again in our task one four movements climbing lino 16 users basically use search and they got mixed results this is what you would see ii you it's just not liner they found different kinds of products three of them were not sure of the search displayed all the right results and the main basically switched to navigation so here is where importance of sites search relevancy becomes more and more critical and then when you go to navigate users basically went through multiple category pages and they basically scroll down to find only two results generally users wish to find more products they only thats what the second then for a medium specific asks where it was somewhere we asked them to find waterproof shoes everybody who searched only got five relevant results five users basically assumed that there were no waterproof shoes so and basically everybody looked for navigation and this is maybe what they found when they type waterproof shoes right.
rep,and this is another and users were happy but one thing is users like seeing that color variation basically if you have three different colors in the inventory actually giving the user those three different colors to see which is good good to have feature and what we've also done with unbox this instead of waterproof shoes if i basically say red waterproof shoes and if you have a red color waterproof shoe available  in inventory and say five different designs when we show these results like like you see it here the three results that you show scene which is shoes you will see the red color two different design and you do not see another color which we are trying to make it more relevant for the image and then people who use navigation basically went through these category pages but what they did not find was those specific filters which will help them narrow down the search because when you go through navigation and go through category you will find a broad verity of products filters help them refine their search and  also give them an indication in your inventory so that is something that people thought to be good to have feature.
prospect,nice.
rep,so that was and third was the lower specificity tasks where it basically told users to find what they want somebody went looking for climbing supplies you search the query and got zero results you later basically turn to navigation and one user basically went and look for casual caps use the navigation bar and basically found what he wanted and and basically what people said was probably more subcategories in the navigation but there's something that he help the increase will improve the search experience so this is more of a suggestion that user gave us another thing is one user we made a spelling mistake and that came up with zero results so that's one thing that in the last 12 months we hadn't boxter specifically worked extremely hard on we can basically even within a single single keyword if there are two letters that are misspelled we will still show you the relevant results even if there are six mistakes in a single phrase we still show you the relevant results i mean we couldn't go beyond six because with the permutation and combination involved the backend logistics and the entire computation would have got so complicated that we couldn't have adhered to our 250 second milliseconds basically availability timeouts so but not something that we really worked on so when when we when do when we do spelling mistake we make sure that any kind of mistakes which is sounding similar which is sounding synonymous of a particular variant of a particular category or sure like that so that was something that just want to share.
rep,so that was stage two  and in stage 3 where people basically are looking at product comparison some what's what they really liked that there was a lot of review sites i personally went through every product review the pdp page is extremely detailed you have a lot of information about the products you have a lot of these reviews and you also have some of these similar products that you that you also have which is a nice to have features what could be good to have is typically product recommendation and complementary products on the page that that could also help and what we've done is since we work with a lot of small and medium businesses we typically have built and templatized a lot of these recommendation widgets that you can add is typically everything that yeah that is available on amazon dot com every kind of widget that you would see is typically something of yours templatized it's available as a widget so it's very easy to integrate thing is right so as something and then in the checkout stage people were really happy to see the cross sell recommendation we we suggest that as a best practice so it was good to have and when you get to the return stage which was interesting or issue 25 users we told them to go back to the site 24 hours later eight of them actually went back to check like 30% of them went back to see the same products only two users could recall the products that used and others founded this is the spotters so one thing that we've done is when we get to know through a cookie that it's a returning user while he's searching for something similar if he was looking for waterproof shoes the previous day and if he comes back and starts typing waterproof shoes we show him a recently viewed widget so that he can quickly go back to the same product because as we remember as you remember that we basically had done this survey and we found this 73% users come with an intent to buy we basically want to make make sure that we capture the attention right then.
rep,awesome awesome.
prospect,let us know if you have interested and yeah we should be good for george and benji he's already commerce manager for these guys to that to have a lookup it'll be really good for them.
rep,awesome awesome we'll we'll certainly do that the other thing that we wanted to do i just got new laptop does not have ms office and stuffs just bear with me for one minute okay so other thing i wanted to do is quickly go over and and and talk to you about a brief presentation of what we do the technology behind it probably do a slightly more deep dive on the feature set and you quickly some customer examples that we've been working with as well let's show you our dashboards tools how easier it is to do basically figure things out merchandise paid those rules and so on and so so so what i'll do is i'll forward you to cs a report for you to the view and i'll probably take about 15-20 minutes to go over what is prepared for you one on the neck itself.

rep,if you feel you have to move it around a bit it's it's perfectly fine and get a combi better.
rep,okay great thanks guys awesome so thank you so much again and you have a great evening ahead.
rep,okay so what so basically you have searchspring how long have you been using them by the way to south terrace.
prospect,i've only been using them from june.
rep,okay they just find out static okay and probably the experience been so far.
prospect,it's been okay my you know my data feed is a little foggy and it was tough getting integrated and the far you know i haven't seen exactly the explosive sort of results that i've been hoping for.
rep,or you were led to believe as opposed.
rep,okay okay all right so what do you talk about the agenda so a little bit more about that and then i'll walk you through the current state of the union as beat it on your site and how the product is integrated it for the search experiences and i'll show you where the opportunity live and why is there an opportunity and then we'll show you how we go about approaching the same same the figure in.
prospect,search all right.
rep,so a little bit about us we are a various startup company about four and a half years old they're almost a medium sized name we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the us and we've grown faster than anybody else primarily because of four distinct and unique differentiator one is we have solved a lot of the site search problems are not solved before second we create custom solutions for all our retailers whether your enterprise class customer or a small specialty site and everybody else we have tremendous expertise in scale so very easily gaining up or scaling out whatever your traffic pattern might look like you do not have to worry about that we handle that automatically and we're still extremely affordable and very competitive in our price point and because of these reasons we believe not just today but all in the future we will be the king of product discovery  here some of the customers that we work with so we work with target dot com newegg dot com bealls  department store these are all enterprise customers and we also work with pure online brands like deborah li  pman i'm sure you <> new york and i don't know if you're part of shindig the period karolina but these are all i are 250 i are 500 range i also work with a lot of different platforms including neva i believe you are levi's that correct.
prospect,we are on neva.
rep,right you're just coming out with a neva plugin and we've been integrating with some newer customers for the past few months also okay all right any questions so far jonah.
rep,so let's get into the actual currency of the union at first site search tip now we need to talk about site search jonah the first international customer has theirs with type-ahead right so as soon as i start to type in what i wanted you to see here is a few distinct features of distinct features of searchspring where the limitations come in so let's say i started to search blue<> breath they were blue anything .
rep,<<<need to be here back blue now is that but we're not seeing what we're looking for now almost a customer favorite any % 1 2 is the river of amazing university detailer control these three has in>>>>>.
rep,and to expose that customer to other system products that they might have never otherwise discovered ok and you can see here i see some t-shirt blue and green t-shirt but there are no t-shirts being shown up here okay because what searchspring does is a direct keyword pattern match rather than understanding.
prospect,all right so you got it.
prospect,i get it i'm a little bit <>  crunch oh i get it cool.
rep,no problem .
prospect,what do you guys do.
rep,there's two more examples i wanna share is that okay with you.
prospect,absolutely.
rep,two just to give you an idea this is exactly what's searchspring does for all their retailers <><> copy paste.
rep,i searched for shredder jean it takes me straight to this page which is the skirt not a jean even though have tons of strategy if i look for zipper hoodie you couldn't find anything if i looks a leather boot the only product that it shows it does not take me to actually leather boots result if i misspell anything about you it doesn't know how to auto correct it if i missed a leather jacket it correct leather but not jacket okay so that's is that is that good enough.
rep,okay all right let me show you what we actually do i'll give you an idea of exactly how we function all right so here's a customer called vacparts warehouse and i know that are not your vertical there you are in the apparel space but i just wanted to give you an idea of how different our implementations are for different customers and why so vacparts we have two types of users one who knows what parts to buy in other words no idea what parts to buy but they know the vacuum cleaner model which you have to account it for this they usually have two search box we came in and from a usability perspective we said you can't have two search boxes because what does it customer makes a mistake and the <<>> is on the customer so we type in dyson and you can see here the autocomplete actually shows left side part and right inside.
rep,<<<< me actually guide the customers everything that is having the in the catwalk and then next you start live in see how everything ended computing software based on the women key worker during grocery vertical and i understand you or not the same particle yeah looks like it>>>>.
rep,so what the problem here was in grocery customers by 15 20 from identify.
prospect,those are gotcha ok
rep,the problem this customer was facing well they be used to take almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy the product so what we did was we read annoying the solution to look like this with the auto complete where it actually shows personalised relevant products based on their past behaviour so if you buy chicken without skin in jonah you see at the top if i buy chicken born less donuts then i'll see that up top okay and this is because in grocery you normally buy the same product every week or other week so that's why we were trying to show you the same product but if you if you were looking to buy products that you normally don't buy  you also have on the right-hand side we commonly searched terms some popular brand and some categories and this is all predictive in nature by typing chips it'll show me chip by type in chilli it will show me chilli by typing tomato it'll show me tomato okay here's an example of a customer the outlet it i don't know if you know them out of london and so this is what our interpretation was poor outlet where they sell designer products that if it cap right so designers are extremely important to that.
rep,as soon as i start to type in alexander wang you know you can see here that we show all the different designers that starts with matched and we then also give both suggestions so that we didn't set designer if they wanted to see a particular category of product.
prospect,okay so let me stop you there because it seems great but i'm curious how much of this these suggestions rely on my ready-made architecture of my product and how much.
rep,<<>>.
rep,null however your database is laid out there's a reason like <> from you.
rep,and what is that deferential here because there's hundreds of other sites little dresses and jeans and shoes and short why do customers buy from you particularly whatever that differentiated is that needs to be reflected into the experience and that should we need to figure out working with you and we'll design the experience base for that. does that answer your question.
rep,okay so so that in these examples that i have shown  you prime-rely an idea that it's not one solution for everybody.
rep,<< >>.
rep,yeah so now i will get you into what other elements we did.
rep,<< ========>>.
rep,every permutation and combination of.
rep,keyword and create a senator for that you do not have to do that with our system our system automatically auto correct miss spelling now if you put in garbage obviously when we come people to correct it but 80 to 85 percent of all spelling mistakes can automatically corrected by our system and we have tested our system to auto correct up to 6 key  words in a single word. okay the second difference is not only the auto corrected but we also start showing products based on whatever the auto correction is then the most popular option like this next is stemming that is another thing that you will have to also do let's say you have two hundred dresses but in the catalog one hundred of falk dress and another hundred of wrestles in order for search thing to find all two hundred when i search for dress or dresses you have to create a setup correct you do not have to do that without if you search by dress or dresses you will get exactly the same number of results which is all 200 of them and it gets into more complicated stemming words like ron running knife knives all different sorts of type of stemming okay automated redirect let's say customer searching for exactly what is in your tip top sunglasses shoes women's dress if they type that in in today you want to get the customers redirected to that category page in search when you have to write a redirect rule you do not have to do that without the automatically redirect the customer based on the problem doing that patch any question so far. no. so next is let's say a customer searches for a very high level query but it's not part of your to top okay say in this example i search for mobile we have the technologies to figure out what are the right subcategories for mobile so it could be smartphone the headphones case it covers be teaching and the second piece is we actually show them in the right order with mobile being personal support operand youtube being last because it's really popped but if the customer does not have an intent that is only for customers who have an intent right oh i am about also always too and i'll to be one <<<<>>> one page the customer can see all elements in one products but still bucketed into such and you can see all those products in like we watch it okay next is dynamic filter so today it's somebody searching for interests or system researching per shoe different filters are more important to them for different categories of products right so for navigation you might define different categories and different filters but what happens in search today you only have one set of filters for search what our system does is let's say you set up a specific set of filters a shoe no matter how a customer searches for shoes casually shoe men shoe and doesn't matter how you first issue these filters will automatically kick in but you do not have to manually create any kind of rule we automatically take care of that for a different category for search you have different types of filters and it's just an order of report again doesn't matter how the customer searches for it be automatically show this up this may not be applicable okay let's say you variant if you have the same dress in three different colors okay so the primary image is the same black color and i am searching for a red dress you want to make sure that you show the red image of that dress right we solve that problem also variance problem another problem is specifically in apparel is color synonym lets say.
prospect,yeah we worked through this colour synonym with search going.
rep,yep and this actually comes out of the box with our solution what we do is <<<<<>>>>>>
rep,let's say any wouldn't be with me i couldn't find any diversity first of all you have but let's say there are products that you don't carry and that's where you're looking for that this is some outdated option that some search spring or some other players provide we believe in today's day and age when a customer has interruption in their journey because of your result we need to give them two options one to go back which is we tell review and second should go forward which is recommendation based on their behavior in real time in that session okay now let's say a customer is looking at a particular set of shoes they don't know why they like this shoes or there might be too many reasons why their life issue either way they cannot tell you finalisation true so how can we give them a quick way to evaluate alternative when you click on the link called see similar products under each product it opens up in a modal window and you can see alternatives very quickly without interrupting their search express here's on mobile so in mobile jonah you probably have noticed that you want to show customers and variety of products because you have less space you want to quickly give them an idea of all the variety of products that you have but if a customer becomes interested in similarity you can then now get more like these button opens up in a modal window you like it click on it if you don't close it if you go back to your experience without interrupting here's what we do on mobile with autocomplete we have worked with economies like japan in asia apac <<where many and perhaps this will be tweeting photo just popular and we teach you the four because those experiences>> get interrupted a lot so to get a customer back to exactly where they left off recent searches became the most useful tool next is let's say i search for a very high-level query and you we know that shoes are in man woman boy girl and you okay that might just be this minute work and how do we continuously guide the customer to an enchant this is a ui interpretation of we show the categories we also provide filters and sorting options but we also always show product regardless of what happens you always show product if you click on a category in or subcategory we start showing subcategories i've been also operational travis balsa here's where our filters look like out of the box those multi select any questions so far.
prospect,no let's sit down a bit so how much does it cost.
rep,so we we know that we are more expensive than searchspring however because you already have searchspring so what we typically found that searchspring customers wont switch to price matches.
rep,<< >> .
rep,typically searchspring contracts are breakable the 30 day notice okay definitely check back.
prospect,i'll check on that.
rep,um alright so fine i'm into this so why don't we keep their conversation going i'm not gonns working to my searchspring.
prospect,start talking about this okay we know i started going through all this stuff and it's you know obviously a tremendous product so i want to get i want to you know keep this conversation going on when look into <> okay.
rep,absolutely what's the only thing i want to also add this for you jonah is if you want to switch i no searchspring is only being searched for you.
rep,are they doing navigation also like this page.
rep,okay if you wanted to.
prospect,<> would yeah .
rep,they're doing faster in  navigation so as soon as i start using faster they might be like if i do this then searchspring get kicked in is that correct or not yeah okay.
prospect,and you know i would also help with that.
rep,absolutely so we can help not only the navigation search but also the navigation you also have a back-end merchandising tool that gives you the ability to very easily merchandise both i will give you a quick idea for how easy it is so you can they're looking at this particular to t-shirt you just want to move it around just drag and drop as simple as that you can filter promote etc and what we'll also do for you to make it very compelling case for you we'll also put in recommendation of our own so today let's see if i go to look at accessories looking at this handbag if i'm looking at this handbag these four handbags that you see today how are they being powered are they doing automatically or doing manually.
prospect,we do the manual.
rep,yep so we can automate that for you also wear a be hey if your learning algorithm will be actually huge power and i can show you quickly what that looks like so that gives you a really good idea that it's looking at it holistically where the customer is interacting with their navigation how do we influence their recommendations if they're using recommendations how do we influence their search and if they're using their search how do we influence their navigation so this is our recommendation which is you can look however you want it to look like by the way this is one interpretation and we have nine different widgets of recommendation that we can deploy on your site and all of these three things combined so make it a very compelling case where you will definitely be an improvement in conversion.
rep,okay sounds good.
rep,now you know if you don't hear back from you is it okay to start bothering you maybe sometimes i look next week.
rep,well fantastic well thank you doing every really appreciated time and i and thankful that you were able to make time and we can get on the call so thank you for doing that not.
prospect,a problem thank you have a great day.
rep,you too.
prospect,ask you well i think we've gone over this questions briefly.
prospect,we dyeing the navigation one question i had was i was still confused as in it has to be hosted or sorry it has to be back-end on our server or  can we do it hosted.
rep,so navigation you don't want to do hosted  it because of the seo url reasons right now your existing urls for navigation are already indexed by google im assuming  away so you don't want to change those urls so you don't want to do it hosted the idea is that to maintain those urls we have restful api calls that your team can call and once they call that api we respond in either xml or json and basically you will get all the components that you need to render the results the same way you render them today.
prospect,okay. okay so even though search we can decide to go better posted.
prospect,correct
rep,but navigation has to be back and because of the seo reasons mostly.
prospect,correct otherwise you will lose your seo rankings and that is not a good thing. okay we definitely don't recommend that.
rep,okay i understand understand that there is a shop by category and then i have other things like shop my collection shop by price and all those things and then within those again customers have a we need to filter then down
prospect,is it all part of what unboxd can offer in the navigation aspect
rep,no. so we so can you see my screen kamalesh.
prospect,yes i do.
rep,okay perfect so i went to shop by collection and there is this interim page what you call is the collections but these are essentially what we might call it as a subcategory for example okay so you have halo style as a as a category solitaire with accents past present whatever you may call it right so the idea is that these pages are not literally product pages these are all just category listing pages and you can host them today this way you can change them tomorrow to be something else the category the navigation pages that we would provide would be actually going to the next page here and when i click on halo style for example.
rep,this is what we can provide so you can now make a query and i'll show you what that looks like just to give you i think when i show it to you it will make perfect sense this is the api so let's say if i take this api give me a second i'll just upload it up a little bit.
rep,okay so what does this is this server end point will give you an unboxd server end point  right then this api key will give you a one uniform api key for your account then you basically pass in a category id so based on how your catalog is organized there is some value somewhere where this halo style is identified okay so this api call that you make you you make it api call to this with a cat let's say the category id is 25 just making that up okay let's say it's 12 category on e 25 when he call this in response our server will give you all the details that you need to show here for example it will give you the products it'll give you the title it will give you all the three price points the calculation if necessary and and then you can just basically render taking that depending i guess you showed here twelve products on the page and that's that's what you can show.
rep,okay and we'll also give you basically the filters and stuff that go with it.
prospect,okay the result will change right.
rep,result will change depending upon exact word if i actually clicked on solitaire with accents then what you pass on and that's why you have to do it from the back end right because when you do solitaire with accents you will identify what that what category it is let's say it's category id 30 now then you basically call the api call saying it's 30 we pass in the results and then you basically show that.
rep,it doesn't have to be a number by the way your category id could be it could essentially be say solving this here.
prospect,name of the category.
rep,exactly it could be that too .
prospect,yes now can you go back to the site.
prospect,in here if we can let's go buy shop buy metal.
rep,and if you select any of the metal from there you see how it shows all the irons that has that uses that metal.
rep,correct. so this may not be a category in your world but in your catalogue this might at least be a column correct.
rep,right so what happens in this case is let's say the column that is called metal type or metal or whatever material let's say it's called anything anything like that basically what then happens is you change this to call it whatever your column is and it's a material or metal type or just metal and then you pass in the value whatever that value so if essentially acts as a database for you and based on some of the parameters which medicine will respond with the results so for example you can also come in and say i want category id equals 25 and metal type equals scope then we will give you exactly those results that match those two categories those values.
prospect,okay that's essentially if you go back to the side you'll see that it is a way to filter them down by by something else to by category or by collection. right
rep,correct that's exactly what that is when you actually click on these gemstones on the backend it's basically doing that it's saying for this metal type of 10 karat gold and gemstone equals to amethyst show me the results.
prospect,yeah now the results will be same. right
rep,yeah your results.
rep,yeah this results will be the same now for example if you wanted to give it a certain order i don't know whatever order come in today let's say they are ordered based on some flag that you have in your catalog you can pass that same value out to you and you can order them based on that as well and however you also get the ability to use our back-end dashboard and say i want to order them in a certain way as long as we have that value available we'll preorder them so here what i'll show you what i mean by that is [applause] you good give me a second kamalesh okay. publish by the way where is your it team in house or you outsourced.
prospect,it outsourced.
rep,where where are they of the in los angeles or india.
prospect,they have a team in india yeah the my contact is an east coast.
rep,okay whats the company called.
prospect,kaldev oh// so you work with milesh.
prospect,milesh yes you know him.
rep,yeah yeah we worked with a lot of milesh's clients.
prospect,ohkay yeah okay.
rep,so they know exactly what to do they've already done this kind of work for other clients of theirs using our system.
prospect,that's how i got your name i didn't know they have worked with lots of my clients but they had recommended a couple of companies and that's what that's where i got started.
rep,so here is american vans i think they just went in to live with american advance sorry re there yeah this is yeah this is one of the top three cargo van manufacturer accessory manufacturers in the country almost 40 year old company and they are yeah so they do that's exactly what they have implemented it from the back end but they only were using search they are not using our navigation or any other our product because their most of their activity happens on search anyways they're not your typical e-commerce site right this is more people know exactly what they're buying for in this in this vertical in this industry so they just go for straight for search and it's not like if i got if i get a say roof rack for ford transit there's not like five different types of racks there's just you know two types of racks and that's it you show those two or three and that's it it's not so they don't need recommendations they don't need navigation all that stuff that's that's why the only search.
rep,but in your world there is a lot of different requirements oh yeah absolutely so the leash milesh and team knows exactly and i think they have done couple of other clients who are not in one of the standard platforms like magenta or anything like your dotnet or php back in custom platform.
prospect,yeah that even my site was built by them so they didn't build in on based on any majento.
prospect,or on php i guess.
prospect,if the results are gonna be the same it's just the speed that's gonna be increased that is that where it is for navigation.
rep,well so results are gonna be different oh sorry i got digress there so here if i go to if you go to browse and let me open my demo site so here let's see if i went to men's section hey there's one of your net taxonomy pages and it's gonna be faster that's clear it's going to show these products that's also clear the second thing what you have the ability to do is actually manipulate the results based on what you want so you can now come in and say i want to sort the results based on any parameter that you collect for example you already might have a preference in terms of performance you can create your own ranking for the products so based on that ranking you can sort for the voyage that's how we will give you the results so all your team has to do is render the results but you get to control from here in a more user-friendly dashboard and it's obviously simpler so you can filter the results you can promote you can create a lot of customized marketing stuff when you come in so say i want to boost it for this time i don't want to boost something very quick manipulation from here and then you can show it like you're and then it's faster hopefully it's faster i think you can ask malaysian team to say try try this and then see is it faster if it's faster than you want to go and use it if it's not then you certainly other than the benefit of using the dash board don't want to necessarily you know do that.
prospect,yeah but i'm not too excited about the dash board the only thing i'm concerned about is the speed.
prospect,now you are still not sure it seems like whether it was would increase the speed and yet.
rep,well i i know that our speed will the speed for us we respond within less than 100 milliseconds for any query that we get through our database now i can tell you that this people increased but what happens when you get the data how does php manipulate that parse it if all of that still takes a lot of time then the speed will not increase so i can't really confidently tell you because i don't know how your back-end system is designed if it was magento i would at least have some idea because i would know how the back in this magenta system works then i know that yes it will definitely it should increase the speed if here's the two reasons why i will increase the speed mind you one is if the php manipulation is very fast it's the database where the data is coming from is slow the speed will increase because now the database is getting bypassed you're getting data from us which we are really faster if the database was all so fast the php was also fast it's just some of your servers are pretty slow in terms of just responding to the browser then there is nothing anything that you can do nothing can really change it's it's one of those two things what is really the bottleneck and what we are replacing if you're not replacing the bottleneck your speed will not change i hope that makes sense kamalesh .
rep,yeah
rep,so my suggestion is for you to test is without paying as anything asked malaysian team they know exactly how to upload the catalogue into our system and test it on one category in dev environment that's in <> simply test it take one category page test it you you see that any other page on that category let's say for example you go and say hallo style is what i'm gonna try if i click on hallo style from the home page it shows up in a second because it's coming from unboxd  if i go to solitaire index the accents it takes more than a second its speed is faster you don't even have to actually create any kind of results that just let the results be dumped right you just dump the result then you know exactly how fast the result something down i would imagine they can test this very quickly unless they come back and tell you it's gonna take 100 hours of real time which i doubt.
prospect,no no which i doubt they already tested with html5 php which is the current version and they had suggested to go with html5 but it was only gonna save a 1 second but not two seconds oh but right now i think the load time is around 7 seconds if its 1 or 2 seconds was gonna be good which we were gonna do but then meanwhile i was going to have this conversation so i thought that.
rep,pull down
prospect,off pull on that and see if but then it seems like we have a go both do html5 and also this one and test with all three things and three which one faster.
rep,well it depends again i would say again this kamlesh it depends on what the slowness is from have they been able to tell you where the slowness is coming from.
prospect,no probably it seemed like people talking about php may be causing the slowness not the server because i think our solar speed is good///  what about the data base.
rep,the database  is big we have around 7000 products but lot of variations so each of these products they have lot of child sku so i think around 40000 total skus i think active.
rep,gotcha. yeah my my guess is if the database is not optimised because see ultimately what are you replacing with unboxd for navigation forget about search and recommendations there are some intelligence there that is being provided the question here is a navigation normally if i let's say go to shop by collection halo style .
rep,right php will then make a query to the database right and then the database will respond php will then render the results back to the browser either it's php slow or the database is slow okay.
rep,what unbox is coming in and replacing is just the database you're not replacing php so if the php slow we have no better you're no better than with unbox or otherwise if your database is well we are definitely going to help and it's a database is and i slow and i and my guess is php is not usually slow unless you're doing some crazy manipulation and even with crazy manipulations i have seen php is pretty fast so if your database is slow i would say tested with unboxd before you do the html5 because html5 is a lot of work tested with unboxd very quickly it should have it tremendous improvement in the number of seconds that you're gonna save which take in seven seconds today if it doesn't go to a second i'd be very surprised if it is the database.
prospect,okay.<>
rep,good thing one second.
rep,yeah because we will respond in 100 milliseconds or less so let's say the request comes to us we responding lower 100 milliseconds this is round-trip by the way so you send the request to us we respond within hundred milliseconds and if php is pretty fast let's say the php takes a second a full second then it's one point one second is what you should be able to respond to .
prospect,no that's much faster then yeah i was even expecting now because there are lots of tools out there online tools which tell which tell us the speed and they have gaps and shows how much time each of the things take so isn't there any tool that shows us the speed as well as how much this php php doing is taking and how much the database query others the others time is taking and all those things.
rep,so any outside tool that you see here like i'm doing this one it only gives me the network speed.
rep,see as you can tell here it started at one second right right around here when i had the it mark and it's final page lord took about nine seconds.
rep,right but this only gives you from the browser requests back to the browser requests i'm sure there are tools on the back end but i am i'm really surprised that nilesh and team cannot tell you how it why it's so slight so swell that is really mind-blowing are they limited in any way in in using specific systems like they have to use something that you've dictated to say you cannot use anything besides these things that you have.
prospect,no we are not limited to anything i mean i  think so .
rep,i mean you can see here within a second if you look at the time line here right there are so many things that i just want to make sure i quickly show you what i mean by this is there are certain javascript files i mean they barely take any time as you can see now this index jquery dot php took almost half a second but there are so many files you see here this less than minute a file seven milliseconds four milliseconds your server is responding pretty quickly for files they're already there have you tried a varnish.
prospect,yeah we did briefly i don't know what happened we stopped after some time.
rep,yeah all these problems for you it would have put everything in cache in ram in memory and so every time you make a response its varnish that's responding rather than recalculating php recalculating database it by pass as all of those things and go straight to varnish and every varnish response so that's also.
prospect,idont know why we stopped yeah we used it for some time and i know it.// was it fast/// i think some of the issues we were using it for we had some problems with that downtime queries going on in the backend so if you had to try it because x basis did you vanish because of a same thing they would add in the cache and save some ram but i think i think we stopped after that and being ever had prompted to downtown after because of the server downtime yeah okay.
rep,go t it so maybe what we can do let me do this let me reach out to analyze if you get with your permission.
rep,and yeah let us set up an account let him put in the into catalogue our unboxed servers and let's try one page on dev do you have a dev site/// no but they can they can create one i think they have done that before as in they when i told you they destined out with html5 that they were doing.//
rep,got it// so if you if you have if you dont  have a dev site or they can create one pretty quickly let me ask him to use the api for navigation and see if that makes a difference if it does i'll ask him to publish say one particular which one is the least affecting for you pick a category say nobody goes to tungsten for example.
rep,i'm just assuming i don't know i mean if there is one that is barely used or used the least you can pick that as a category page let's say tungsten is gone and right now it's still taking the same amount of time let's pick that let's see if you respond any faster for navigation and that's it we'll just take it from there.
rep,try it that's all i'm saying .
rep,yeah. that's good let's do that that's a good idea
rep,all right try it i mean do i don't know if they will charge you to do the work there is no cost from unboxd unboxd will make our systems available for them to try this and whatever the cost that they might incur that you might incur from them is the only cause that you'll incur but at least you'll know and then we can .
rep,and if you want to do you continue on the hosted page and the recommendations  that's something you want let me see if the product detail page what happens there that's pretty fast is that correct.
prospect,oh yeah product page page details page and everything else is fast.
prospect,it's just it's just a navigation yeah yeah something.
prospect,i think seven seconds is pretty slow.
rep,i would say anything anything more than half a second is a problem.
prospect,well half a second you're talking about the back end right.
rep,no so if i if i let's say i'm on category page right here let's //yeah an inspect element just to make sure and let's say i click on this first product so maybe it's taking its time to load the entire page but it seems like the majority of it if it gets done in half a millisecond or under a second that's fast that's good anything above a second you'll start losing 10% of your revenue.
rep,this is what akamai tells us by the way.
prospect,but keep in mind we also have some third party calls that we do on the side leg could chat we have we have the one top bar where they can click and vin <> those are all third party calls even on the left they yeah .
rep,what is this by the third party call. what is this by the way if you don't mind
prospect,they can they have tool one of our box a<>.
rep,is there a company that you using for that.
prospect,ad shoppers .
rep,yeah i know ad toppers yep okay yeah that's okay see all of those third party calls render afterwards because they are based on ajax it's the first page that loads so let's go back again and maybe i'll make the screen a bit smaller so you can actually see our page [music] so now if i click you see most of the page has loaded it's now all these other third-party things that are getting rendered .
rep,so most of the page does get load within a second or two so that's pretty good in that sense for your product in details. .
rep,how about the navigation go back to the navigation
rep,see navigation is definitely not the case so here let me clear this out lets it shop by mr. <>
it seems like the navigation is rendering within three to four seconds let's pick maybe because i was on that page already.
prospect,because it's on the cache.
rep,it could be yeah let me just try a new page okay yeah see majority as you can see here the <> majority of it gets done within three to four seconds it's the rest of the page is taking a bit longer to render.
prospect,hmm .
rep,that's big gestone just trying to try a couple of things.
prospect,that's because of third party call.
rep,just to see no i just went to the gemstone page it still hasn't rendered yet okay this time it took longer see the first rendering took place at ten seconds and the cluster happened at 14 seconds that is long that is definitely long i'm just going to try a few of these you .
prospect,okay yeah sure but there's no way to tell right whether it's the database that's taking a bit longer php .
rep,no no not from here now there are tools that are available that will be able to help you on the backend correct .
rep,but not from the front end that would be very hard to tell i was just giving you a customer's perspective of what they might see although it's not seven seconds is what you thought some pages do loading four to five seconds.
rep,now some pages look take 14 seconds to load that's a different issue but there are pages of loading five so let's try that if you're ok with this kamalesh with your permission let me reach out to in the laois if you don't mind just letting him know bae from your perspective that i'll be doing this so he doesn't you know get caught off guard.
rep,you look all ask him to set this up he's gonna want you to create an account and stuff so can you tell me what even have ii could use to create an account.
prospect,you can use it on your character and jjigae my email that you have.
rep,oh did you use the same one. got it okay
rep,anyways i should a quick email to neelesh and cc you
rep,yep perfect cc me and then that will be fantastic and then i'll will reach out to him start talking get him to upload he has access to whatever he needs to do this thing right .
prospect,yes but yeah i also asked him to test out the same thing with the html5  sure and and also i would note that some of the pages does take what 14 seconds like we just tested yes and and yeah just so so then if we are testing any category maybe we'll test the carry but it takes 14 seconds right .
rep,if you sure yes so that will be the best way to do that it sounds like it i think it was this job by gemstone thing i had picked diamonds yeah i picked diamonds you can try it again if you want to. yeah
prospect,yeah lets do this okay.
rep,so shop by gemstone click on diamonds.
rep,<><><><><><> it's definitely took much longer than last time it's are you thinking huh yeah.///it took almost 30 second//
rep,let's me that we'll just go up yeah 29 point 11 seconds for the first thing to respond.
rep,it looks like it's maybe it's <> a server that's the sick with server other database it may be linked so he can create three separate test test pages one or maybe four right php with an html5 at the same an html5 with the current correct now even with html5 they still have to go back to the database to get the data right it's just that php is not being used to render results or maybe.
rep,somebody still used i would imagine.
prospect,im sorry.
rep,okay still some php would still be used i would imagine okay let's let's try that yeah let's try them to tell them to say php with unbox php with just html5 php with html5 and unbox if possible and then those are the three right php and just unboxd php in just html5 and php plus html5 plus unbox.
rep,that works .
rep,okay.sounds good.
rep,all right so i'll wait for your email kamlesh what i'll do is i'll piggyback off your email i'll create an account in parallel will give nilesh the credentials to that account and he knows how to upload a catalogue and do all those other things and then we'll support him to figure out whatever he needs to do to verify this we'll go from there.
rep,no problem awsome
rep,by the way kamalesh on the other stuff on search and recommendations are you okay do you have any questions on that or.
prospect,no but i would rather when we do it right no i dont have any questions.
prospect,yeah because i the recommendation it seems like it's straightforward .
rep,yeah .
prospect,it's just deciding on which way to go as in hosted ajax our our back-end knowledge which i haven't made up my mind i was thinking if hosted it's not too much work then maybe we can do that because we don't change the header and footer that frequently anyways .
rep,yeah hosted we do all the work for you so you don't even have to worry about milesh's team the only thing we need from milesh's team is the catalogue and maybe the deployment of the analytics part but all the the search dot dazzling dot comm all of that page development is done by us.
rep,let me take one of your html search pages html stylesheet jquery i will sort of replicate every accordingly.
prospect,okay yeah i'll think about that but most i'm more inclined on having it hosted but again if you go with the navigation route and if they are gonna have everything built back and then why not do even the search in the backend .
rep,yeah and if it actually works with back in with navigation because it's making the thing faster than the milesh and team we can support them to do the actual search pages as well.
prospect,okay okay yeah recommendation that's just plug in right .
rep,yeah that's the front end thing similar to how you have the ad chopper think it's sort of ajax base popup yep .
prospect,okay okay so that's fine but now for the recommendation i know you have different ten almost ten different widgets.
rep,
rep,and he told me a few now it takes time for having getting those indexed right when you say index right.
rep,do you mean <><> for them to get better .
rep,well i mean it it does take time for it to get better what we do however is the very first thing we ask is to deploy the analytics so by the time we are developing all the other stuff the analytics is starting to get collected we don't have this cold start problem that's what you're defining here what are we in show on day one it's so that we don't have to worry about that the analytics piece gets deployed first .
rep,two three weeks worth of analytics to know but what is being viewed on the side what's being sold what's being added to card etc and then it easily picks it up picks it up and piggy backs off of that data to start showing a recommendation .
prospect,okay okay yeah so i think i think that works fine and that yes navigation let's good proud that we just talked about.
rep,absolutely .
prospect,and yeah .
prospect,you dont charging any less.
rep,that's a great answer.
prospect,when we talking about price what kind of discounts you can offer under i know you you are getting an education piece with the same time that you're offering the recommendation the such many really appreciate that for throwing that in and i know there's a 60-day time period right.
prospect,there's no contract.
rep,is that there is a contract but you can always get out of it in 90 days so give us a notice for 90 days and you can get out of the contract.
prospect,okay but how any any discounts any chance get a better price.
rep,um so we based on your catalogue size because you have so many variations the 40 k variations that we have to store that itself is a big cost factor for us unfortunately let me do what i can do let me see what i can do to figure this out i was able to get the navigation for free because i wanted to make sure that if you're able to help you i really would like you to try to see if we can help you or not if let's say the navigation thing doesn't work out okay because you have more navigation than search right obviously so navigation is going to be a bigger cost for us and so if navigation does work out where we increase your speed and help you resolve that problem the navigation is free that i would hope you will see that as a huge discount if navigation doesn't work out we're we're not in helping you improve the speed at all then navigation is free or you pay doesn't really mean anything right so for the 750 let me see what i can do i'll run it up the flagpole to figure out based on the storage cost what can we do to manipulate and i'll definitely try to come back with the best price for you .
prospect,okay really appreciate that .
rep,yeah your welcome absolutely so sending email out kmalesh whenever you get a chance please will piggyback off of that i'll also mark my team members on here i think abhishek  is on the call and abhishek  and then we'll make sure that we coordinate with nilesh will get this tested out and hopefully this works out for you before the holidays thinking it would be great yeah yeah .
rep,ye ah you're welcome absolutely anything else kamalesh 
 anything else i can answer for you.
prospect,no there will be all we'll see you how it goes on the results goes from there.
rep,okay perfect sounds good.
rep,okay thank you.
prospect,alright thanks bye everybody yeah we'll look for your email.
rep,all right and where is it bigger journey towards conversion and where it's not what will decide to for that.
prospect,okay  .
rep,okay so i want to make sure that that's the caveat and because that is where our expertise is we wouldn't necessarily know how to comment on anything else i mean you can comment on it we wouldn't be necessarily based on expertise is that fair.
rep,fantastic so starting with a product discovery stage what we gave them is task one is a highly specific task was over-the-knee brown boots do you buy these the customer response is then recorded as 18 out of 25 customers use site search remaining seven used navigation so this is pretty much smack in the middle of industry standard that we have seen so far we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the us and where all of the customers that we've done this study this is a pretty standard percentage it's usually between 65 to 75 where the intent the idea here is when of the intent is very very clear if it's highly specific a lot of customers will use site search versus some very few customers will even that use navigation however what is important to understand is there's always customers who will use navigation users appreciated the keyword suggestions and visual autocomplete on the search which help them get an idea of the products available the keyword suggestions were helpful since there are so many products listed on the site but there were a couple of feedbacks in terms of where they were saying starting to say over-the-knee and the suggestion was only one it was only taking them to that category.
rep,particularly so it was just saying okay i get the idea that i can quickly get your category.
rep,but i might not be getting the suggestion of what is possible in that category.
rep,task two was medium specific where we were we users were told to look for stripped striped striped cardigans sorry about that striped cardigans so the customer response was 12 out of 25 tried to use site search which is also again very half-and-half middle remaining 13 use navigation to the pro product but this is sort of in the middle task 3 was very low specific task it was just saying buy anything you want from the site now we did not tell these customers by the way what method to use they themselves decided to use search they themselves he decided to use navigation that is all up to them so here only eight used site search 10 used navigation while remaining 7 clicked on various banners on the home page to browse products so this tells you this last stage tells you when the 10th is not very clear most of the customers will actually navigate and use browsing taxonomy varies but however very small percentage of customers will always use site search so this is the opposite end of the spectrum where the other end is it's highly intense no very clear intent small percentage navigation when there is 0 intent small percentage search the.
prospect,so the higher the specificity higher use the site search and then more general the higher to use for navigation.
rep,correct so if i were to go to your site because your site search is a bit smaller in size and it's also not prominent if you just think about it if i will come to your site my first sight will go obviously to the banner then the contrast of the taxonomy will capture the eye and obviously these contrasts will might catch on yet this definitely gets lost a little bit.
rep,in your particular case while the focus will participant had 72 percent usage of search box when the intent was clear when you look at maybe at a broader scope the percentage of site search might actually go a little bit lower because of the way the search is positioned so in this focus group it seemed like it was 72% i think in general our experience will tell me there will be more closer to 65% towards the low end of the spectrum when the intent is extremely clear.
prospect,haa.
rep,but yes what you basically said is clear intent more search less intent more navigation.
prospect,mm-hmm got it.
rep,now also depends on how clear your taxonomy is for what the customer might also be looking to buy so that also impacts site search so if i was looking for knee-high boots because you have shoes as your first level taxonomy it makes it clear that the customer has has the ability to get to boots within one step if let's say for example shoes was not your first level taxonomy i would guarantee you that for shoes you'll get more site search when the intent is clear.
rep,mm-hmm .
rep,so it's a lot of factors but that's that's what we can tell so far looking at the site.
rep,is that clear am i making sense.
rep,great perfect all right next is product selection stage so this is where they've actually figured out whether they use navigation that you search whatever they use or banners this somehow got to a subset of products okay so for high specific tasks looking for over-the-knee brown boots when they searched they were not shown any results it actually came back with zero results although what i did look at afterwards was there is a category called over-the-knee under shoes are under boots i believe.
rep,so again that's that's what the result was so two users out of 18 abandoned the search which at this stage now these are focus group participants we hired to do them to do this work so they didn't abandon anything but what they do at this point is they come back and say what do i do i don't know what to do next if they use those types of words or sentences then we know that if they were by themselves at home or at work they would have abandoned search next is navigation of the 18 users who use navigation to look for over-the-knee boots including the ones where it's switched over from search were able to find their preferred products under women's shoes in sections very easily so navigation definitely made it very easy the one thing did come back was your filters so they were using color filters and i actually was standing next to one of the customers where i saw this experience was they clicked on one of the color filters and you get this black border around that color right.
rep,but if i pick black color i don't get that acknowledgement it's not very visually possible for me to see i know about making sense there so if i were to go quickly just just give you an idea i go to color you can see i can see white very clearly a black is a very subtle i can see when i hover over it but i can't tell we've actually clicked on it so there's a lot of different ways to slice this it will convert into the>>> particular customers then when i click blue <<<<that it is all about a blue box like let's say black click to select>>> that apply for this to actually work.
rep,so that was not very clear - especially because you can see i pull up here and then i do the color box right how do i uncheck uncheck the blue now i have to clear all and i have to go back to the<<<>>>> fact that i remember getting
rep,all right. so that was medium specificity site search for above tasks where they looked for striped cardigans 12 out of 25 users searched for it again shown no results three users a abanded that's the this agent remaining remaining users switched over to navigation and again i think struck parkins is also a category for you in navigation view so switch over from navigation we're able to find the products of their choice through the manual keys with low slip three for me about ask there were some users who searched use site search for those posted by the side you want right for blue denims and was shown irrelevant results what user wanted to look for sneakers first but typed aquarian as misspelled sneakers and residential another user wanted to buy backpacks but type the query as to two words back space packs and was also shown 0.
rep,results so there were a lot of different ways some of the user types tools you later change to search query to scars and was just a correct results product comparison state okay so this was discovery and selection now they've actually somehow figured out the products and they're actually drilling down into evaluation of these products so in comparison 10 out of 25 users were looking for similar products to compare at this stage.
rep,and users appreciated the complete the look recommendations and the similar product recommendations at this stage so you have both of them there so that was something that they did find and and we saw that having those two by the way are those done in-house or do you use some technology to do that. //<> or the and or the new may also like .
rep,yeah all of those are empowered by our in-house engine but though you may also like don't repress <<<>>>> currently as our yeah .
prospect,that's perfect what about search<< that is no we just>> switched over to a third party for that .
rep,can you tell who that is.
rep,uk<<>>>.
rep,okay next is the checkout stage on the checkout page users wanting to see complementary product recommendation in this stage as well there was no other recommendations at all so it would have been great if i was suggested some accessories or shoes to go along and and and i understand so this is again you have to take this with a grain of salt because that's what the customer things because they may not actually be in the mindset at times and we were just saying.
rep,<<<<>>>> evaluate this and let's see what what you expect or what you're doing expect because if i'm spending 400 or be the theory is let's not distract them is showing anything else they're about to spend a lot of money let them go through that<<>>> at so i don't know if that's the theory as to why not to show however what we have found is that and i don't if you have defensive products but when somebody is spending a lot of money the the recommendations can be something very bioscience if i understand or if i colors lots of stuff i could easily spend if something if the if the merchants of the buyers have figured out that these are really good complementary products but the be speed is extremely love you know it's like twenty dollars or you know something very very low.
rep,then you will find that both you think work and help you increase your eob .
prospect,mm-hmmokay.
rep,okay next is the this is something i personally had the experience with i was on the site saturday morning at eight o'clock pretending to be a customer and i spent our kids coming into a room at eight thirty eight hours passed by and now after eight hours i'm trying to get back to the site so my experience was what will the site do for me to get me back where i had left off because this this is a very much common occurrence in in e-commerce today so we try to recreate it i certainly didn't remember the products that i was looking to buy although i'm not your demographic either but we did try to recreate this we asked all our focus group participants to take only a 15 minute break and we said very clearly remember the product you're very interested in and that you would want to buy.
rep,and but only to after 15 minute break only two users could recall and others found difficult to products that beuter li er and to spot look isomer did say it would be easier if you were shown products we viewed earlier on the homepage now because you are a brand in a sense that you're not trying to come across as sales easily.
rep,the homepage is all about looking feel and embracing the brand aspect of it right so a lot of times retailers shy away from showing certain products or showing certain widgets of products with price points on them on the home page the reason if it's okay to show a certain time is depending on what the customer experience has been for example if i'm coming back in half an hour it is okay to show that on the home page if i'm coming back for after thirty days maybe it's not so okay .
rep,right because if the experience for example i'm looking at it that this at work over lunch and you know just during the lunch break i got distracted whatever i come back from come back from whatever the distraction was i want to finish looking at it i might have closed the browser i might have to reopen it showing it to me you're making it easy for me to get back to where i had left off .
rep,so in those instances it was a question.
prospect,yeah so do you guys and these make me lot of sense are you guys able to validate the actual <> this numbers.
rep,so we have done that a smaller clients a lot of our things usually just has just have the recommendation widgets out there regardless of the time frame is<>> you can have the recommendation now it's all about the look and feel in terms of what it really looks like blend into the core of the page across the sale day that's number one number two is because you don't have to always show price is about <tails enos don't you approach that i've seen> before title the description the image all of that stuff is available for you to show me what i've already seen <and the> results vary but we have seen that that absolutely does make a better make a difference they're useful in <><>home page also makes difference if you show it up at five folds below at the bottom it's not gonna work if you show maybe the first few folds definitely works.
rep,so yes in a short answer is yes but whatever number i give you it's just a number well i would recommend really interested in figuring this out we could try and experiment it and we can try and <><> the recommendation is not a blank space it will collapse.
rep,<><>  oh i'll show you what i mean by that so let's say let's say i went to pura-vida mm-hmm okay there we go so here's the two widgets that we have one pair of your hand pick just for you and recently you okay.
rep,<that's it i was> first time coming to the site so let's see if i were to say incognito and i knew pura vida that means the excite doesn't know who i am then you can see that the recently viewed is collapsed it's not a blank white space that it leaves in .
rep,right so right there it's it's not there yeah that's what i was trying to say.
rep,in here how okay all right that's it grace next is feedback suggestions so all the customer feedback in our suggestions for each one of them it certainly seems that site search is a lot of opportunity i don't know what your traffic is what your experience with the practice site search and recommendations in some cases could be opportunity for <not sure the so one of the> what are the things we did was just to give you an idea of just to give you an idea of what are the different types of queries somebody could actually search for okay so we tried 12 different query types to give you a taste of how many different ways a customer would search for and so here one is exact search where we search for printed miniskirts you know pretending these curves only wanna show up.
rep,bermuda's you have bermuda's none show up blue denims we talked about that's a feature search where i'm actually using one of the attributes of the products in my search query.
rep,next is relational search so lounge wear this could be this could cross a lot of different categories it could be tops could be bottom it could be shoes whatever may have your comfy shoes linguistic shortcuts where i'm looking for sports wear .
rep,look for that no results subjective search high-quality jacket i was actually looking for a little black dress and i only saw one result i think a little black dress is one of the most quintessential search queries have you seen in the equal apparel industry.
prospect,<><><><><><> think the reason why you're finding all because it's it's starting to seem kind of strange to me that all of these are working.
prospect,but i realize we did turn off a tract in this past week because there we have some issues around performance so we buy all of these.
rep,ooh.
prospect,so i think i think it has turned off for the time being but i mean that's probably that probably explains a lot of these i'll chill yeah but yeah okay well places love it when you do turn it on mm-hmm some of these queries and see what the performance doesn't matter if it is that's fantastic if it's not then you definitely know you have .
rep,so then that's good and i'll just run down the list and then at the end is all the key takeaways just organized no more tabular format mm-hmm what happens is the product discovery these are all group stages and if something works there's a yes if something didn't work there's a no.
rep,i'll be thought of comments on it .
rep,and that's it that's the it's the analysis .
prospect,great this is really helpful thank you so much.
rep,jen you're welcome any questions any thoughts .
rep,um i'm definitely going to be looking at the site search to see i mean i think the i think the way i sort of pain and then i want to say i think was part of recommendations i feel like we yeah i mean it's something that you know we've tested for some time now and depending on like a third party and we were definitely open to continually testing it but i feel like donna i think less surgeons for sure and then i forget the other part but yeah and we definitely helpful i i think it's definitely the user testing portion of it that piqued my interest.
rep,so as a feedback yep yeah no problem well we'll send this to you if after you enable attract it still doesn't work we're more than happy to walk you through why we are able to solve all of these queries .
rep,whatever that cannot ants what other person in person in terms of the technology that you can have to merchandise you're not just search results but also your brows and category pages their navigation pages how easy but difficult it is to manage that using user behaviour popularity data etc.
prospect,okay yeah can you actually um explain that a little bit more um what you guys do with regards to the actual taxonomy and navigation on the site.
rep,sure so let me show you <this is the> pure beta site timing in yeah sorry about that okay so let's say i go to the men's section .
rep,okay and or i go to the women's section do the matter so here's a link i'm going to my taxonomy we give you a back-end dashboard that allows you to merchandise so here is our certain merchandise.
rep,rules and you get the taxonomies mapped to our back-end where you can go and merchandise let's say i went to the women's section so this is what the site looks like this is what the backend would look like and here you can now filter the results by any attribution that you have in your catalogue you can promote by sorting again by any attribution you can booze so let's say i just making something up although it should work there you go so as soon as i put in title contains eliza all the eliza products start to show up top eliza if i now go to the women's section i'll do like the products will instantly show up top then if i wanted to say i want this select the product to show up first then i want this eliza product to show up seconds if i go to women's you see those two products up top .
prospect,so it's more about merchandising that actual product not <>
rep,yeah it is when you say navigation is that you mean filters these or when we say navigation what i meant navigation is i click on the texonamy so i can go to say clothing and tops for example and what products would show up when i say clothing and tops which order is what you are determining that's for to actually figure that out.
prospect,okay got it.
rep,it right then you also have the ability to figure out what filters show up right so right now if let's say i'm looking at tops you have designer size colour these are the filters that always show up.
rep,if i were to look for shoes if i were to say boots i get thinner sizing connor maybe you have attribution on material maybe you have attribution on something else and if you wanted to have different types of attribution in different order because it's still showing you the same order .
rep,right you can have different orders based on that so i'll show you what that would look like so let's say for womens in lessons you want to create an order that's if i want to show size first then i want to show colour wait i want to show brand first on the hide category and that's it that's how i want to show it.
rep,if you can this is how easy it is to define what facets and filters in which order of those.
rep,based on what you can control in here .
rep,and search will automatically pick it up once you define it once here so you define it for the category and search will automatically pick it up .
rep,you have to define it for search yeah so now it doesn't matter how i search for dresses red dress blue dress black dress party dress cocktail dress doesn't matter the school girls will show up in the search results .
rep,so hopefully that answers your question and there's a lot of other things we have ab testing you can do within the browsing so you can define and say i want to show something based on this merchandising rule for shirts let's say or for dresses for example like .
rep,come here and in one rule you want to say i want to show these six products up top in another rule you think that these six products should be shown up top.
rep,whatever these different merchandising goals mind we thought it might be your analytics team is saying yo you know what this is how we should we'll show the products then you can have all these a/b testing tool right built into it you can then define and say i want to do this only on desktop only on mobile only on tablets and we'll report on the result so that's it .
rep,hopefully that's it answers your question.
prospect,yeah that does thank you.
rep,no problem so i'll send you the experience study obviously take a look at it you're coming to shop cart over it if you have any time please stop by our booth.
rep,we i think it's 11:40.
rep,to show so and you get the time please do stop by and at  least you get to see the face behind the voice it's not pretty but.
prospect,[laughing].
rep,at least you'll be able to see and the company and stuff like that.
rep,alright awesome but thank you so much grace i really appreciate the opportunity any questions i didn't answer.
prospect,no that's it for now .
rep,okay all right awesome if we don't hear back from you grace which is the good time what is a good time to wait and call back and if you don't get to meet a shopper problems etc.
prospect,um probably towards the end of the month and after.
rep,the october i'm assuming.
prospect,yeah i'll give us time to troubleshoot yep .
rep,perfect all right we'll try to do that we'll try to reach out again towards the end of october we reconnect again.
rep,okay awesome by the way just one last question for me to come to the east or west by any chance.
prospect,you know i don't i mean some folks in marketing might be out there but i actually don't go<<>>.
rep,got it okay no problem sounds good thanks grace.
prospect,thank you .
rep,no problem you too.
rep,okay all right awesome so lawrence first of all thank you so much for giving us the opportunity here to talk to you and we have prepared a quick overview of what you have requested from a customer experience study perspective before i get started quick check can you see my screen yes you should usually chingy website perfect and give me two minutes 30 seconds 60 seconds idea of what you're looking at what got interested especially was that interested in you and talk to us and just everything about regula to to make sure that i focus on those elements that are important to you for today's conversation .
prospect,so we're a motorcycle care retailer we've been around for about eight years we do we focus on service quite a bit and not on price so we're not very price competitive most of our products are on map or map control so we have different segments of our audience depending on what kind of bike they ride and you know this site has kind of been evolving since it launched but i think it's at a point where we need to figure out what collection to take it next.
prospect,so the mold little level has been driving a lot of the discussion obviously and our mobile site is a little bit different but reflective of the the desktop site so it's just kind of we're at a point now where we're kind of picking direction we head in.
rep,gotcha and what got really interested in today's conversation for you there's something specific you're hoping to get out of this.
prospect,i'm just curious how people used to say because i i'm not a rider and i find some of the things that are on the site hard to use but people who ride like love them and swear about them so i'm just kind of curious you know how how an audience would perceive some of the features.
rep,got it perfect alright so let me share continue to see my screen right.
rep,all right awesome so what we did do our customer experience study lawrence is we hired 25 focus group participants gave them three individual tasks and have recorded what their feedback has been what their experience has been positive or negative and recorded that into the support now the methodology was we gave them three tasks but we didn't tell them how to do that basically tell them by this by this by this.
rep,and how they go about figuring out on the site how they use the site it's all up to them over it now if there was a negative feedback we have categorized into three different types of severity so there was you know severe moderate or mild and primarily unfortunately maybe and you'll appreciate how you do this but we primarily did this at desktop now we didn't do it on mobile because it's very hard to experience and you know standing on somebody's shoulder and looking at other bull sight unless you're doing it one on one which is not necessarily as scaleable the twenty five folk.
rep,however some of the ideas that we have found are definitely applicable in mobile as well okay now there are five different stages that we measured customers on discovery stage selection comparison check out and return the caveat here lauren is we are not experienced in the entire e-commerce what you might call an ecosystem what our expertise is and our experiences is in product discovery and when i say product discovery is how do customers buying navigate discover products on the site two different stages so where why we say the checkout stage it's not a question of did the channel take too long or it had too many steps it's more about were they able to find product during the checkout stage okay so that's what our expertise in and that's where our experience can actually come in and come in handy and say okay this will the experience from the customers perspective was it right or wrong a wall we couldn't tell you even if it took a very long time to check out we don't have the expertise or the experience to really make a comment we may comment as a customer but that doesn't mean anything right so i just want to make sure that did that caveat you were okay with it but that's what we've done actually.
rep,okay all right i hope that's not the complaining .
rep,okay all right so this first name is prada discovery stage so the idea here was three tasks task one with highly specific the first task was by i'm assuming cloak limb or climb snow boots and you know the customer response was seven out of 25 participants used navigation to find a product 18 out of 25 actually used side search to find these products so you just pointed out that they could see that the product same product categories were repeated as part of the autosuggest autocomplete suggestions so this was for those customers who were using the search functionality for example they were saying instead of showing to millions of cats and two meters of pans they could have shown us an assorted products or sort of discovered new products however when you're starting to type in the brand you can actually show that it's not just individual products that there are categories within the brand that you actually sell right it's not just six or seven products that you sell so that was one of the biggest opportunities that we found on the site other than some of these are some of the other aspects where customers felt that they had to wait and type in at the entire keyword to actually get the right sort of product versus the site actually helping them and guiding them to what might be available through the site.
rep,a task two was by the way another point to note from an experience perspective is because the task was so specific the intent was very clear you can see that a larger percentage chose the option to search which is a small percentage to the option to navigate task to was medium specific we're total look for gps unit 12 users use navigation while remaining 13 news site search so now you can see the task is somewhat vague it's not it's still specific but not as specific as the first one so more people are using navigation which is a credit to your chicano that they thought that they'll be able to find gps units looking at the chicano because when you have a very large catalog that's the biggest education so how the chicana means laid out is what prompts the customer to use navigation was the site search a lot of times i hope that means i would clear the air lauren what i meant there.
prospect,okay task tree was for those specific queries users were told to buy anything good but one other site just knowing tent clarity did buy anything you want to rely on the site so only eight customers news search ten use navigation and seven used a click on various popular product of suggestions and brand links on the homepage okay so that was sort of the spread .
rep,now that was a discovery that's how they got started for each of the individual tab the next stage is the selection we actually are starting to interact with the result whether it'll search result so there was navigation result or whether it'll click on any other banner so product selection stage for high specificity has customers who navigated 22 users navigated because there were some who switched over from search navigator to show category and we're able to flying find a filter by relevant product and brand easily however one user wanted to search for the product by availability and found that there were no relevant soldiers to do so but it seems like there are other products that availability is a pauses is that correct .
rep,so not sure why not also available is it because it the dropship product.
prospect,no i mean it's because there's different colors and size combinations so you'd have to do that in order to know if it's available not.
rep,got it okay customers with searched 12 out of 25 users to search for a klimb snow boot is it klinb or klimb <>.
prospect,its klimb.
rep,perfect so klimb know boots were shown irrelevant result one users did abandon the search at this page now i want you to know we hired this participant so they didn't abandon anything it's just that the reaction is typically i don't know what to do or what do i do next that's when we know that if they were by themselves at home or at work or anywhere that they would have abandoned the the interaction at that okay.
rep,relevancy definitely seems to be an issue here again so they they search for climb snow boots and obviously maybe for snow boots showed up but you have tons of plans as i look at through to the site two users who choose to find the products or services those they found that they had to reselect the brands and the product category to reach the desired product so i think it seems like the context aspect who wasn't really clear even though the brand was clearly stated in the search results in we're having great if i was the split this was all in the first sentence without having to filter by the way that keeps the purpose of that whole search box okay and this is what they had to do is put a little dose down there okay medium specificity i don't know if that a common the ferns lauren in terms of research experience on the site or not but that is at least what we found on the site second was medium specificity with navigation for the task of looking for gps in it storm one of the other 25 including one who switched from source search use navigation to look for the product under three thousand navigator to accessories category and selected the navigation in that and we're able to find this product for search however again the same problem
rep,if you search for the gps units and they were shown jackets in the same and to definitely abandon the search at this days or something if i did not have relevant results this is again how they react what words do they use to tell us so this is our interpretation of what they would actually do a field by that stuff now please big change to search for you to just gps and we're showing relevant results the single word queries work but two word query seemed to have a problem seven remaining users who initially in site search switch to navigation no specific tasks here for site search for the above look anything one of the eight users wanting to look for motorcycle parts for his honda cbr 600 r but the typing cbr space 600 rr and we're certainly shown irrelevant results here again change the query to cbr600rr one <> shown relevant results so there is a very lift tolerance in terms of again site search seems to be the one that comes up another wanted to look for gloves but missed eyes the corneas gloves and was shown the result got it okay another wanted to look for cheaper jackets on a search results page they wanted to sort the result page on price notify but was then shown irrelevant results but they just wanted to find cheaper jackets but it's gonna be sorted based on low to high and it was only not shown any jacket so that's again from a relevancy perspective it seems to be coming up and again and again okay next is product comparison stage so somehow they've actually narrowed down the specific set of results that they want to look at again any of these methods that they might of use any questions by the way lauren i know i'm going very quickly and dumping data but any questions so far.
rep,i'm sorry what was that no okay all right product comparison states so here users were happy with the product details and reviews shared by other users so that was very positive they found this information useful in defining a lot of the product 10 out of 20 on users were looking for similar products at this page the site shouldn't mix suggestion which further confuse the users so if i'm looking at a harness slight plus against this is a source of armor protection the suggestions may be more complementary rather than alternative so the idea here is if a customer is on a product detail page they're showing an intent because they're interested about something about that product but a customer could be in two stages on that product detail things one they may just be evaluating or second they're very interested in that product if they're evaluating you want to give them the opportunity to evaluate other alternatives in case you have not decided on it because otherwise what the experience really looks like lauren is with me let's say force will harness so let me just so here i'm starting to go into the particular product and i may have an intent to buy it i may not have how can i get other products that may be similar in this nature may not be from that same brand but similar in nature so that i can evaluate alternatives because otherwise my alternative is either i go back or i restart the interaction either by navigating or by searching again i hope that made sense i in terms of an experience perspective so the reason you don't want that to do you want you don't want that customer to do that is because if a customer is creating any unnecessary extra clicks the probability of them converting on the site decreases by 10% with every click so if they have to do four or five clicks certainly the probabilities half in half and it's been very hard to come back out of that aspect so giving the customer and more alternatives to continue their journey on it's also very important okay check out page so here on the check out page customers did want to see some complimentary products so and that is again depending on the business that you're in now if for example today if i'm buying a 350 dollar product they feel remind me you don't want to truly describe the customer by giving them any kind of recommendation on this page let them just finish the conversion right and then maybe on the thank you page you can tell them oh by the way here's some other additional accessories or anything complimentary that you can buy this is that the theory lauren to the two natural recommendations of the checkout page.
prospect,yeah very streamlined experience .
rep,got it but so in on this particular page of a customer if they prefer is buying something that can be optimized by giving them something very complimentary for their very small price point i don't know if you experimented and tested a bad idea and have seen result or not seeing results.
prospect,yeah we've tested that .
rep,okay all right fair return page so this was a personal experience that i had i was spending the spending time on the site on saturday morning 8 o'clock spent almost half an hour on the side saw wood was i really interested in i have a neighbour who by the way is the buddy right bike and if i was work sitting down with him to actually go to the site at trying to pretend to be a customer because i'm not a right or myself either i used to ride a bike when i was sort of living in india though but not here in the us my wife just denies that.
rep,she's a respiratory therapist so she's being enough coming into the hospital because of that you like that's not happening by a night a car.
rep,if you need show so unfortunately but so i spent the time with him trying to figure out what we look at you know spend half an hour kids come into the room eight hours pass by i'm coming back to the site and seeing what will this site do for me to get me back to where i had left off okay so we wanted to so let me create that experience and we ask all 25 users to take a break and come back after 15 minutes not a lot and we wanted them to remember the products of the headlock however because you show recently we used product it becomes very very easy so that i'm sure you guys have tested that so that made it perfectly easy to for customers for these participants to sort of get back to what they had looked at so that's it lauren that was the customer experience study through those five different pages and then we have all the feedback and suggestions based on what we saw in our experience and expertise sort of itemized here one of the things that we did notice and if you're at all curious about this is some key takeaways that we saw specifically because we saw an opportunity with search i don't know if you guys use anybody for search today or homegrown do you know is it home ground or do you use anybody for that .
prospect,nobody yet we have a vendor.
rep,oh that is <>.
prospect,no right now.
rep,all right well it seems like the vendor is not necessarily doing this particular  job it's being because we tested the site search functionality to a lot of different lenses so adopt a lot of different types of queries and 12 to be exact because what unboxd has classified is about 12 different types of query and we found 10 that did not work so almost 90% the queries aren't working and you're definitely paying a vendor that's not giving a result so what are those types of queries clearly playing snow boots not giving the results we showed you that gps units also the same thing this is something i did by the way okay this is not what the participants did this is i spent some time to try to figure out what can be shown and what can you what can we show from a performance perspective this pdf creation tool actually overruled okay ladies waterproof gloves and honda bike cover so this is what ladies waterproof gloves is showing honda bike covers is showing this next is head protection you can see very clearly that it's  not giving you the right results bike gears subjective search like cool sunglasses zero results for non products if i was searching for a return policy for example or exchange policy it still continues to look at the product catalogue rather than giving you the faq it has to be intuitive enough to be able to do that as well natural language searches if i was searching for jackets under $50 it does not understand the natural language processor into the keyword in women's category when searching for jacket it shows men's jackets so this is an implicit search if you think about it if you let's say go to target for example and in target store physical store if i was in a women's section and i asked the salesperson with our pants or jacket there's no implicitly that there are you looking for women's jackets and that is the same sort of an experience that a customer could have on the site where they are looking at a particular category a very high-level category they implicitly ignore to tell you that they're looking for that category subcategory products like jackets in this example so you need to understand from a individual customer perspective the personalization aspect in the search experience also and that's is some key takeaways things with something does work there's a yes if it doesn't work it's a no and basically grouped by each and individual stage the discovery selection comparison return check out and return and that's it lauren i don't know if this is what you were expecting or not but that's what we had worked on.
prospect,okay yeah what i know is so like product search specific but you know it's interesting i mean i know we we've had back and forth with our vendor about the search and stuff so you know this is just good to have good information to have.
rep,okay perfect and i can send you this report i don't know if in what size the type of contract you are in with them which are evaluating alternatives i don't you have an opportunity there or not but we have three distinct products lauren so while it seems like it was to focus on site search it was primarily because after the initial participant feedback we realised that site search is the biggest opportunity for you guys in terms of where the user experience is lacking so from navigation perspective for example if i were to navigate this seems to be doing its job because you guys have figured out where the right high-level categories to show so the customers going to quickly get to individual subcategory the search however is not doing the same functionality and i don't know how what percentage of customers on the site search you have a huge catalog acting from from what i can tell which tells me that you will have a healthy percentage of customers using a site search and if site says here's a very good rule of thumb that you can use to measure whether your site searches optimized or not if your let's say your overall site site conversion overall site conversion is 18 percent or 5 percent your site search conversion should be at at least two to three times your overall effective evolution if it is not if it is one and a half time or close to one time your slicers definitely means an update and then you're losing out then you can easily identify what is the opportunity you're picking out so let's say your site conversion at 3% your site search site conversion at 3% site search is at 5% assuming that it should be at least twice or three times let's say 6% to nine percent depending on what percentage traffic you get you can very easily calculate what the lost opportunity is from a search .
rep,that's a very good way to know and tell your vendor - are you performing or you're not performing.
prospect,okay agreed.
rep,okay perfect any questions.
prospect,no i dont think so
rep,okay do you i mean i don't know if this was interesting enough what you know products know about our product would you evaluate i don't know what the next steps in your mind are but help me out just give me some advice some guidance as to what you're thinking is next step.
prospect,um i'll probably take the report kind of go through it no more detail and show it so few people here and i'm not sure where we are in the contract or the other one if they're extruding if you're indian house i really don't know the status of that so i just have to talk to them and i'll let you know at that point you know if if we want to keep going if we should talk again in six months or you know what that looks like.
rep,got it perfect so is it okay lauren to maybe reach out to next week to just check in and see what the feedback might be and it may be as simple as wait a couple of weeks and .
prospect,yeah i need couple of weeks. i'm coming to shop the doors.
rep,oh are you coming to shop the door.
rep,we are we are exhibiting at shop the door maybe you can drop by say hello.
rep,yeah it's great yeah no problem absolutely well thank you so much appreciate the chat and we'll go from there.
rep,in study i wanted to sort of understand i know but last time when we left off i think there was a cost limitation at some point from an integration perspective and just the amount of work that was required anything has changed from that perspective in your opinion or this was just something you wanted to do it was good to have just wanted to get get that out of the way so that i know wherever you stand.
prospect,yeah yeah we're we're very price-sensitive um you know we were i have to take a look at the pricing again um to kind of refresh my memory but you know comparable costs as last time we spoke.
rep,got it no problem so what have you guys done anything different on the site i know the design is still the same new products or extension any re-platforming by any chance i know you were talking about them - last time.
prospect,yes we upgraded but still on x current and you know no major design changes we kind of gave the cart page a little low face lift and the mobile site we changed that updated that a little bit but nothing nothing else really.
rep,alright let me do this for you i will just open the.
prospect,yeah oh and also one thing i wanted to run by you is i have another phone call at 3:30 so i will have to be off the phone by 3:15.
rep,got it so 3:15 eastern so 45 minutes roughly 40 minutes is what we have.
rep,no problem it should be good to go we're good to go there yeah let me share my screen did you see my screen.
prospect,i see there we go okay .
prospect,so basically what we've done here travis is we have this customer experience shared is trying to figure out how this product discovery in general work on your site right so in order to get a customer's perspective of what their experience was on your site so what we do is essentially we hire the the research method is we hire 25 focus group participants we give them three tasks and i think well here it is we give them three tasks and then we measure their experience on the site while accomplishing those three tasks okay would you be sending me this pdf that we're reviewing so to share this there's a small fee of $2500 .
prospect,oh just to send me that okay.
rep,<> .
rep,i will send this.
prospect,good to know your humour hasn't changed.
rep,no problem so then we show is essentially the measurement is across discovery of products so as you remember our expertise is not necessarily in everything ecommerce right so we he's taking a long time to check out we may be able to see that they take a long time to check out but we may never be able to interpret as to why but if they are having a hard time finding a product whether it's search whether it's recommendations whether it's navigation we do have an expertise in understanding so we the focus is pretty narrow it's only on those elements of product discovery so i wanted to make sure you the caveat was clear and when the customer experience any kind of feedback in whether it was good bad or indifferent we've categorised it as whether it's good or bad and but it's bad with subcategories it to be severe moderate or mild oh okay.
prospect,aaha okay.
rep,and here's the five stages that move analysed the customer on discovery selection comparison check out and return the return is not that they're returning the product but returning means when they're coming back to the site .
rep,okay and check out again is not necessarily the checkout process but do they discover the right sort of products on the checkout page or not.
rep,so starting with the first stage product discovery task one was highly specific insect repellant plans right the customer response was fifteen out of twenty five used search can use navigation so here you can see two things one is when a task is highly specific more customers tend in site search and fewer customers tend to use navigation now typically the percentages are around 65 to 70 percent level you search the reason yours is a little bit lower which tells you that your navigation taxonomy is pretty clear so customers think that they'll be able to find these products through the taxonomy which is why more percentage of customers actually use navigation.
prospect,okay that makes sense so would you would you be comfortable saying that people first try to find what they're looking for with that top navigation and if they cannot then they resort to the search function .
rep,so when the task is highly specific the first interaction for majority of them will be search not navigation.
rep,okay typically majority would mean 65 to 70 percent but in your case it's like a lure which means that more people you search still but to a lesser extent and a little bit more percentage of people use navigation as the first interaction.
rep,so it is possible that these 10 users could have used navigation and then went search if it didn't successfully find it from navigation.
rep,so one users were happy somebody did comment that t hey were able to see visual autocomplete features however they did spot some redundant suggestions like shade with the shades.
rep,so you know from that perspective there was a lot of redundancy in the autocomplete so now what this creates obviously is a confusion between the customer to say if i click on shade will i get one results so i have to click on shades what's one so you are confusing the customer and asking them to make a choice number two it's not an obvious choice let's play that way number two yeah you are wasting that space where you could have suggested something else also in sort of the same word twice.
prospect,okay that make sense .
rep,okay task two was medium specific so it's not highly specific but it's not just genetic either it's sort of in the middle citrus fruits okay so thirteen customers use search and twelve use navigation so here you can see they're pretty much equally split and this is pretty typical by the way so forty-five to fifty-five percent of your customers when it's a medium specific task will use either search or navigation it's pretty split in that sense and then the third task was buy anything you like on the site just look for anything you want which is a very low specificity tasks so here majority of them use navigation as you see but there is that small percentage that will still use search and so this is the other end of the spectrum right when the task is highly specific small people use nav navigation more search when this task is low specific very small whole search very high navigation.
prospect,okay yeah .
rep,okay now navigation could also mean clicking on banners on the home page etc and the users did say that they wanted to see more offers on the home page what basically what they were trying to say one other i remember this because the user specifically said that how do i know what is the this companies known for like they were referencing another company i forget something bulbs dot com and i think it was michigan both are not mistaken .
rep,right so if you go to michigan polls on website you can very clearly tell that i think based on seasonality this is the best product they want you to buy right now right it's about to be springtime so what should you be buying for spring versus when it is fall time what should you be buying for fall right like you want to do your if you want to grow tulips and it's already past summer she leaves growing tulips is more like a fall activity where you grow you bury them in the fall until spring in spring right basically .
rep,what does that experience so but right now it's pretty generic regardless of whether it does not come across and to say oh this is spring time best offers of a promotional perspective okay stage two was selection this is where let's say highly specific insect repellent and plants site search 15 users searched and only got two results obviously there's a lot more products that match that criteria but only two of them got five users assume that the site did not have enough such plans and abandon the task so obviously they didn't abandon it we paid them to be there so they'll say is work they'll use words like i don't know what to do or what should i do next then we know that if they were by themselves they were abandoned the site all the remaining users switched over to navigation if they didn't find it through search they'll give it one more shot for travelers who navigation now within navigation all 20 users including one who switched over went to shrubs and hedges category and got really confused but where to click on click to get the product but they mean they mentioned that they would have liked to see some more subcategories in the navigation mark based on such characteristics so that they can browse products of peppermint shape it was just named heap sometimes you have to take this with a grain of salt because you might have 200 subcategories and it's not physically possible for you to .
prospect,right yeah.
rep,like that what that means is that you need to create a one high level second category that actually helps you narrow down these subcategory lists not that thing you need to put them into the taxonomy but even when i click on that subcategory that landing page could give me the sub subcategories third level categories .
rep,right medium specific tasks citrus fruits search all 13 use site search did get relevant relevant results but they complain that the same product was being displayed multiple times and i think this might have been.
rep,primarily based on either whether it's zone differences that's not zone difference or size difference correct .
rep,actually this specific problem that it is due to how do i explain this some agricultural restrictions so if you are in california we cannot ship let us certain say a citrus tree to you from where we are in south carolina but we have a drop shipper in california that can send that to you in california was shipping within the same state.
rep,same tree.
prospect,so one of the what yeah same tree just different shipping source so one of those is a product that is specific only to say california so if it's a duplicate in the search results yeah we should probably definitely fix that.
rep,well i'm assuming that you have same product twice because if depending and what they pick the the fulfillment piece gets picked up on the back ends and can it not be a variance where you can say pick where the location is and then it automatically figures out what product to what variance.
prospect,that's that's kind of what i would like to do for search .
rep,got it because then it would be at the end towards the fulfillment side of things that you have to actually decide and say do we dropship or do we ship .
prospect,correct yeah that exactly .
rep,okay all right users also complain that they wanted to filter by price but were unable to do so so it seems like obviously there is no filters and i think this is something i remember from last time when we talked about that if you get a lot of results filters do two things for you obviously they give you the ability to filter the results down but they also give you the ability to see what you have in the results set in a very quick glance so if i now see price as a filter for example i can actually see what the ranges of products i have in what price range is ranging from $10 to $500 or is it from 10 to 15 .
prospect,haha yeah.
rep,and different different filters give that different sense of range so customers get a clearer understanding without going through every single product page or a results page so what the results actually contain okay next is for navigation for still for medium specific tasks so for above tasks full of looking for citrus foods drive users clicked on fruits and berries and then went to citrus fruits and we're unable to see all the citrus fruit trees every users clicked on trees fruit trees and wanted to refine the results again we're unable to find a relevant filter so they had to browse through all the products to see to find citrus fruits .
rep,and three of these users then turn to the search box so the reverse happened some users were not able to find the results through the search went to navigation some users were not able to find through navigation and wrench search so imagine that customers experience if they were not able to find through navigation go to searching search also fails creates an even more bigger problem because now they think that you definitely don't have these products.
rep,and what we have seen in our experience is customers who go straight for search will give the website three or four chances of searching before they give up but if the customer goes from navigation to search they only give them one to treat chance for search because this would be their second failure in discovering a product so the so the patience has already run out have to have to be passed away when they're searching so search in that sense becomes critical especially coming from navigation all right low specific tasks so one user wanted to look for a shrub below three feet and use the search button and got only one relevant result later they switched to navigation bar and clicked on shrubs and hedges and partial and used filters based on size and they were happy to see the result another user searched for red flowering plants and was shown mixed results his experience would have been better if had the option to filter color now i'm assuming the color is not an option because the catalogue doesn't contain that is an attribute.
rep,got it. is that is theirs i've been an experienced travis where this is a problem or no.
prospect,oh i bet it is a problem actually.
rep,oh for the flowering path part of it.
rep,right so is there is there a project to add color attribution or .
prospect,that's something that we probably should do yeah and i think that is possible .
rep,okay on the other comparison stage so this is the third stage now so they've somehow figure out what they want to really so they're now evaluating products users were impressed by the product details as they found all the information they were looking for so that's the testament to you guys because there's a lot of product details users could see similar products to compare with which they also appreciated and users also wish to see recently mute suggestions as it would have helped them compare products they had viewed earlier so there was just one feedback where and they would have said oh i forget that fifth product that i saw after the third product that i searched for how do i get back to that so keeping a track.
rep,of products that they've seen helps them quickly get back to where they wanted to go if they do want to get back to that.
prospect,uh-huh .
rep,or stages to checkout stage users were shown some cross-sell recommendations on the card page i like to say because it showed some additional products i can consider buying along with the product in my cart is what that's good and then the return stage so all 25 users were told to visit the site again so this is a personal experience i also had this is something i was trying to do with some other site i went to the site at 8:00 in the morning saturday and spent about half an hour on the site looking to see what i wanted to buy kids come into the room eight hours passed by and now i'm going back to the website right what was the site do for me to make it easy for me to get back to where i had left off right.
rep,so that's the we wanted to recreate that scenario and see what the customer experience really looks like so we asked all of them to take a 15 minute break and to remember the product that they were interested in by and then we asked them to come back to the site and we start there's their discovery only two you users could recall the products they had viewed and the others found it difficult to spot the products they had viewed earlier so here again that recently viewed piece comes in very handy because it would be easier if we were shown products we had viewed earlier on the home page it also creates by the way as it also creates essential personification for the customer.
rep,right .
rep,you don't have to you name that section recently view you can name that section and say products for you or your products or something like that so the customers can easily see the products that they've seen before and can get back to where they wanted to go and that's it this is the feedback and suggestions all sort of grouped together based on all the feedback that we got so there will be a customer feedback and our suggestion behind it and here's the summary of each age on what the different parameters are that we evaluated this and whether you guys do it or don't do it so in cases where you do do it we tell you you do you do great if you don't then you don't and and that's it that's the experience study.
prospect,wow so so it seems like kind of the biggest takeaways are filtering within the search more parameters within the search such as colour and then like a product comparison and then recently viewed sounds like those that kind of the big four.
rep,correct the other one was the autocomplete.
rep,oh yeah okay a little bit and then the last one would be the duplication of the products.
prospect,yes duplication products yeah and you guys definitely optimise the drop-down results correct.
rep,yeah we can actually do all of them auto complete the filters in the search results the duplication piece maybe a catalog data problem .
prospect,yeah yeah that wouldn't be on your end they'll be on our end.
rep,correct but definitely the autocomplete the search results you also have our recommendations while i know that you're recommending you also have some sort of recommendations but like recently you something that can be automated is something that you also have a look in your culture do for you the .
prospect,can you uh would you have time sometime next week to do on another product demo with me i have like you know bits and pieces of of a few memories of of the demo and i'm sure you guys have expanded upon what you offer but i remember you guys offering some good stuff is it possible to do that.
rep,absolutely yeah okay and from our perspective we are you looking to the demo for search and recommendations both possibly .
prospect,um yeah yeah i'm happy right now with our recommendations but not not is that where i would no it's not .
prospect,who do you use it for don't mind me asking.
no its okay so a company called rekko r-e-k-k-o oh um but yeah definitely um if there's something better out there then i'd be interested.
rep,yeah and i think you know one of the key things like we talked about you have the recommendation is but i think the idea is this is such a visual business you know philips looking at flowering trees and stuff i want to make sure my recommendations are still visually appealing and you know even from a design perspective we can do a lot of things so i try to make sure that they their focus is on the actual just on the product rather than getting distracted from from anything else because recommendations when if a customer let's say has an intent they might look at some of the details but the first thing that they might if they don't have an intent it might get attracted to look at is based on the actual product image.
rep,so that's what i was trying to say it's it's not about just showing recommendations it's about how you show them as well so so we can talk about all of that absolutely so next week let me just quickly look at my calendar i know you are going to a conference etail west are you there by any chance .
prospect,no we won't be there .
rep,yes same time in the afternoon.
prospect,yeah 2:30.
prospect,yeah i'll be.
prospect,ok so 3 pm
rep,eastern march 2nd we'll talk again.
rep,and in the meantime made sense to you as in an email .
prospect,uh yeah thank you.
rep,absolutely you're welcome and with an invoice of 2500 like i said before.
prospect,yeah yeah go ahead and just send me the invoice and we'll see.
rep,you will also pay me accordingly right so .
prospect,yeah yeah can.
rep,it's like here's the invoice and you'll be like what we'll do here is this coins jingling that's the payment.
rep,[laughing] okay no problem.
prospect,yeah yeah i appreciate you going through this and getting the people together to go through the website um there's a lot of good information here i really appreciate that.
rep,ya absolutly no problem you're welcome.
prospect,sure they're great thank you very much i appreciate it .
rep,all right awesome thank you .
prospect,all right bye.
rep,hey now i want to find gold and i find one maybe two and i just have to go through a lot of pages to find one which is why i would imagine that that a lot of customers on your site end up searching because i'll tell you two things that i also found on this side and just and this is not to criticise your site by the way okay cal this is just to share what we had found and two sort of create a parody so we all agree that we're talking the same stuff .
rep,but please don't take it personally.
prospect,no no do a redirection where we couldn't understand.
rep,perfect so right now if i see that i am seeing a lot of a lot of plates i have no idea how many i see that there's some three pages or four pages worth of plates and i have no way to filter the results by either category which i already filtered and price maybe i could filter it down the price if i colour was really important to me i have to go through my colour and even in that case i might say okay tableware plastic gold elegant gold table over and that's the only way that i could really find some gold paper plates anyone in that case i have to go to a lot of pages work page worth of stuff to try to figure it out right you see what i mean.
rep,okay perfect so this is why a customer search on your site so let's see if i now search the experience today on search is plates or it's like gold plates or didn't see this this is all i see six or seven products and this is actually a lid for a plates and not a plate and so even in that case i'm stuck with what my options are and you can see there's none of the square plates show up either right so and i'm assuming that this is the problem that you're not happy with right this is the functionality that you're not happy with today is that correct.
prospect,let's try yes.
rep,okay perfect now even if i go to advanced search this advanced search i believe is the bigcommerce default search is that correct.
rep,so if i now search for gold plates one it takes a really long time to show me the search results it actually took seven to ten seconds for the results were actually pop up so i'm assuming this is the second or the third problem that you're not happy with in terms of performance.
rep,and when even when it actually shows the results now you can see here after 10 seconds it's showing me results it's still showing me a lot of blob then a lot of redirects paper napkins i'm looking for plates you know why show me all these categories just stretching in plates and while the results may be somewhat relevant they're not always relevant and which is a big problem with bigcommerce native search that in this particular instance it may seem like it's relevant but in love there's a lot of instances where it does not come back and a relevant search results so that's essentially the problem you are looking to solve and you're looking to find alternatives to solve that and on top of that the fourth or the fifth problem might be you're looking to also optimise it for mobile and tablet based on what you just said .
rep,okay perfect so let me show you what unboxd does to give you an idea of who we are what we do and where we come from okay so here's what i've prepared as an agenda real quick i will tell you a little bit more about us and show you all of my.
rep,<><><> .
rep,okay no problem.
rep,[talking internally]
rep,[yeah i'm sure our website once once i search by weight you show me one of them something regarding the presentation does he want the commerce attacks okay i'm just walking you know all the pictures and i don't know a lot of presentation you just showed us what it looks like if a customer looks remote let's try it i'm going over that so he's showing me now a building two things this company yes this is showing the money so he's showing me just now is just a walking position i'm gonna give the curb in the middle one in together means it's something else a listener we want will be like oh oh go ahead sir just scratch all this what you go .]
rep,okay no problem okay.
rep,what is your partner's name.
prospect,just so that i know to rebecca she just walked into the office.
rep,hi rebecca my name is mano patel okay so what we were about to just get into rebecca and cal was the agenda for what we're prepared to show you how about solving some of the problems that cal had described to us and we were just trying to go through those so the agenda is we'll tell you a little bit about us who we are who we work with where we come from and then walk you through all the different elements of site search and how you should be thinking about site search from a best practices perspective both for desktop mobile and tablet .
rep,and we'll show you some of the opportunity why unbox why sunblock so uniquely positions to really help you and we'll also show you what our technology looks like along the way is that fair.
rep,yeah that's fine.
rep,all right awesome so a little bit about us we are a bay area company out of california we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the us and we've grown faster than anybody else in this space primarily because of four unique differentiation one is we have created and solved site search problems that were not solved before and i'll show you what those look like second is we create custom solutions for all our retailers regardless of whether you're an enterprise class customer or small speciality site you have tremendous expertise in infrastructure and scalability to easily scale up and scale out and we're very affordable and extremely price sensitive to make sure that the customers are able to use our services in a very conducive manner and because of all these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery i hear some of the customers that we work with today target dot con and newegg dot com these are our our enterprise class customers we also work with some pure online brands like deborah lippmann webpart shindigs these are all i r 250 i r 500 level customers and we also.
prospect,one second is <<<>>>>
rep,it is yes.
prospect,okay we will call competition where the same space as them .
rep,sure so i i saw what you are selling but you have a specialty niche to talk about elegance and posh products right shindig sells everything .
prospect,no yeah we'll see we actually are spinning off all our sites we stopped one massive site both marketing purposes where he actually owned like five websites.
prospect,so we do not live here there are work in progress this is the first one you have a couple other ones they're all going to have two different different you know categories got it .
prospect,okay so how much to make yeah i like what they see they're so i see their i see your search bar which is really cool now i have a question for you .
rep,yes .
rep,when when how does your program read is it do we reach the keywords what does it read nor won't even do it so oh my and what do i do on the back end
rep,got it . so in bigcommerce we install a plugin that takes care of giving us two things one is the catalogue so it actually sends us the catalogue that you have so we index that catalogue to understand what are the different types of products whether the different attributions of this product to give us an idea of how a customer could search on your site when the customer searches we actually match all of these indexes and try to show the best results so let me show you exactly what this looks like give you an example of few different customers that we work with so here's parts warehouse this is one of our customers i know these are not in your in your vertical but i want to give you an idea of how different the solution can be depending on how the business you work what business you are in right.
rep,i do understand go ahead.
rep,so parts warehouse has two types of users one who does exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have so they used to have two search boxes one for parts and one for models we obviously came in and said you cannot have two search boxes because one you're putting the onus on the customer to what is they pick the wrong search box and three you can only optimize one search box at a time so we designed one search box for them now if i'd start to type in dyson you can see that the left hand side shows hearts and right hand side shows models for dyson okay so that's how we design the autocomplete to look for them this is us patriot tactical by the way they're also on big commerce and you can see here if i now start just type in nike let's say nike banking products you can see how i quickly start showing what nike products are available in tactical shirts tops undergarment etc boots some top queries and also some popular products to give the customer a quick idea of all the different products than 90 might have if i'm searching for boots you can also see a lot of different ways how we actually find boots now the interesting thing that i wanted to show you was is that the filters that we talked about cal if you remember on the navigation the left hand side filters were only departments and price right so us patriot it were had also same problem the problem was they did not have any kind of faceting information available all of these facets that you see the toe type i j and their width shirt shoe size etc was all created in collaboration with their team by unboxd so we actually help you extract some of these values to create good and good filters for search results now it's important to know why should we create that is because a customer when they're searching for certain products might see hundreds of them filters not only help them narrow the results down but it also gives them a quick overview of exactly how and what is it that they met the results contain right so they can quickly see ok all the price ranges this all the colours are this this is what i have in my search results this is what i may be able to narrow the results down by okay
rep,ok so that gives me an idea of what what these options look like ok next is a grocery customer again very different vertical but here in grocery if you look at your past grocery run you'll notice that you probably bought lots of products in a single transaction right same is true for online grocery so almost 15 products on an average are bought in a single transaction the problem however these customer ran into is that it would take too many clicks to buy these 15 products it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these products so to solve that problem we designed the autocomplete to look like this where the idea in the theory is that customers buy pretty much the same products that they always buy every week every other week most of the products are the same and they have some exceptions to what they might be looking to buy so here if i buy a chicken boneless breast i'll see that up top if you buy a chicken without skin you'll see that a top right and so the idea was to personalise the experience for each customer because the frequency is so often for products that you normally don't buy you also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories so.
prospect,how come shinnok's doesn't well.
rep,shindigs doesn't do that because it has to depend on the business that you're in health the idea is people don't come in and buy on shindigs every week or every other week.
prospect,oh i seems on of data you know.
rep,not data it's the behaviour of the customer in.
prospect,<><> data i mean you don't have enough customer information .
rep,so let me let me share some some differences so in grocery me has one customer or you as cal cal is buying grocery every week or every other week right you go to the grocery store once a week or once every two weeks correct .
rep,but you don't buy paper plates party supplies every week or every other week you probably buy it once every three months once every six months maybe three or four times in a year.
rep,so providing this kind of an autocomplete does not necessarily help endings what really becomes important for shindigs and this is what we are coming up with new for shindigs just to give you an idea it's something like this so here this is how we're trying to define the autocomplete so we are figuring out a way to shape show quick get them to quickly go to a certain area based on the time of the year so what we've noticed is that a lot of times certain months like graduation graduation is very important in may and june so when somebody starting to type in graduation or or anything along those lines so celebrations etc we want to make sure we show graduation up top during holiday season we want to show holiday seasons types that stuff up top so that's what the idea is in terms of how do we quickly get a customer to see certain things very quickly but it is not a question of giving them the ability to buy right from here because these products require a little bit of engagement the customer wants to see what this really looks like all the different elements of what the products should be they want to actually see and figure out before they actually make a decision to buy so that's why the experience is not the same as the grocery .
rep,yeah okay but are you saying is but i think i like what the grocery store if you go back to that one minute you have this thing where it showed you brands and show you you know i like that like for colorado kleenex whatever your showing other .
prospect,go back to before when you gave me a cup yeah here commonly searched popular brand to see their categories .
prospect,yeah see that up right.
prospect,<><> week we're very wouldn't that shoe things well not so much people don't always look for a certain item to look for collection because they want to wrap off the rest of it means if they want they picked a certain color for their wedding they want the rest of the matching set they want to make sure everything matches shinnok's if you're looking for a balloon you don't care what type of balloon's not you just want a balloon for me everything but it has to match .
prospect,so i think this is very cool what you happy with the big basket and the big basket is an indian grocery store site.
rep,it's in asia.
prospect,asian side yeah because i see yeah so is this something that we can request for us and is this something like get sort of customized when we start doing things.
rep,that is correct so we customize our solution for everybody because he's be what you say you convinced me you got me i've done my own research so you guys did a great job for your presentations awesome here's the deal i'm hardly a company to do my redesign okay.
prospect,but the name of the company is also a big commerce although i gotta get the further one use them it's very happy this posh baby pish-posh baby stay with you for one second .
prospect,in the name of a firown' we were we're considering hiring his names on the bottom of my friends website it's called ey studio.
prospect,yeah yeah and with the next.
prospect,ey studios and .
rep,got it .
prospect,so yeah so we've been talking to them and my friend will open a new tab over to open a new tab on your thing okay type in pish-posh baby pr sh right yeah now that's my friend okay you scroll to the very bottom there it is yeah scroll to the very bottom 10 now you see there he watched studios you got him that's how i found garlic oh and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna this i'm making a list of things we want to modify on our site and then i'm gonna recommend and you know i don't want to do anything and then go back to what redesign company like you know whatever you should have told us in advance you know sober i don't want to use you guys for what you want at least run a barn okay .
prospect,that's why we're up to we're gonna give it over to a professional let them uh integrated for us got it so the idea would look bad i however used to have the redesigned unreleased in progress by the end of the year.
rep,got it so the question of cal for you is you want us to talk to you ey studios collectively come up with to help
prospect,yeah this is one of many people working with them.
rep,got it okay.
prospect,i'll be honest with you the guy who i'm dealing with his name is kurt of kurk kurk kurk kurk k-i-r-k but i'll definitely know this is this looks index is our huge competitor they're very successful company i'm sure they did a lot of the research you you you basically resolved a lot of our issues just on the own merit so i'm pretty comfortable what can you show me something on a mobile site that you guys did.
rep,sure i believe that meeting i can give you some of the screenshots that i had captured specifically for this because there's a lot of thing that we wanted to show you let's stop mobile there we go so here's what autosuggest could look like on mobile its scope suggestions recent searches popular queries you also have ui elements in terms of how we guide the customer through different search results filters here's what our filters would look like autocomplete not auto complete multi-select and a lot of different filters out of the box now this can also obviously use your colours and fonts and style to customise it for you but this is what our filters would look like out of the box .
prospect,what website are you english that you looking at.
rep,so i'm gonna have to find out i know that we did for a few of them so let's to tell the lipman so deborah lippmann is a fifty million dollar company rebecca probably knows them cal that's <> products yeah she does and so they do you have let me just try to quickly give you an idea give me one second .
prospect,okay sure take your time.
rep,okay so this is what we've done on them if you can say pink here's how the mobile stuff looks like does that give you an idea .
prospect,okay perfect.
rep,pink nail color .
prospect,okay you can refine filters using this kind of stuff.
prospect,yeah its cool i got  that chip yes i just keep back to my website one second.
rep,through your website yeah just so unless what ask you a question oh no how you know something i don't know what to do at it go to the search bar on the magnifying glass.
prospect,okay i can gold plates like you did before okay you scroll down from it on the sidelines i understand the first few searches keep going and all overs are left okay keep going down no now why did the gold company coming up i don't understand how sometimes things pop up how how do we eliminate this issue it wherever there are things there we don't wanna there's always a way the company sean not.
rep,correct because the search is actually doing an orange a technique calls or or so what it does it it says i'm gonna look for the word gold or the word plates and i'm gonna find all the results and start showing them now you might have some default order in terms of how products show up which is why some gold plate shows up and some gold cutlery shows up the way to resolve this is by doing a semantic relevant search so when i'm searching for plates right the idea is that you need a system that understand that when searching for gold plates that plates is the product and gold is the color attribute so i'm searching for gold plates i want to see plates with gold colour up top rather than see forks and knives and paper napkins and this and that.
prospect,okay so does your program mean that.
rep,yes our problem our program will solve that semantic relevance that is correct .
prospect,okay great so let me show you i'm 90% in i'm going to just wonder why the rest of this team the rest of the read about we design team but i would definitely recommend you guys as you seem to resolve it uh you guys seem to understand our industry on because you actually just a client which is perfect i don't need to go you know wow i love the grocery store well you did there is perfect but i i don't have to explain you have a client that's very slim attire so that's what convinced me i like what you're doing .
rep,i'll give you two more pieces of things cal that if you if this question comes up you at least have an answer to.
rep,let's say if i think of of typing in the wrong key word okay so i i typed in plates but i misspelled it okay so now if i do it first of all this is a very limited experience from a customer's perspective this is very very anti conducive for them to be able to figure things out .
rep,so what now needs to happen is let's say even if i when i do the grand search and i come in and say i want to search for gold plates if i misspell gold plates will take ten seconds to find out what it actually comes back with and it says did you mean gold plate and it starts showing these results it's forks and knives it just shows some gold plates but essentially starts with some forks and knives and spoons even though it thinks that gold plate was the word that i was looking for okay that is something that unboxd also resolves today any other system that you might go to to resolve that you will have to create synonyms on the back end manually you'll have to come in and say plates is equal to plate this misspelling of plate is equal to the correct of plate and every permutation and combination you do not have to do that with unboxd and box automates these problems and solve them through our system so if i were to and we've actually solved it for almost 6 different keywords being misspelled in a single query so if i was misspelling black leather jacket every will autocorrect black leather jacket and start showing results for black leather jacket .
rep,you don't have to create synonyms and stuff like that also which is a big problem in the which is a bit shocking.
prospect,it's really cool i have these website stuff you know that i look at all the time like i told you i look at unix all apart we're in the same space we sell similar products we are targeting people who are the party space so i'm gonna use that as a big matrix what we're trying to do and you did a great job great job of presentation so do me a favour.
rep,yes sir.
rep,sure absolutely yeah i will send you  information no problem.
prospect,ok awesome i really appreciate that i would think this would be very helpful and i'm just gonna give it over to the design team to work on .
rep,okay so when you do decide cal there's two or three different elements to consider one the design we need to talk to the design team so we can help them implement this solution on bacala.
prospect,okay sure.
rep,that's one number two is it's not just implementation it's also designing certain elements because we've done so many implementations we can give our thoughts the design team can ultimately figure out how to design it but they cannot come up with a thing that looks like pluto and our recommendation is mars right give you an idea so just so that those elements are aligned they can't come back and say oh we want to show something something really awesome but it's not practically possible to do something like that and the business may not necessarily from a customer experience perspective it may not really stop being cool and being there not functional right so it becomes very cool but not functional for the customer which you know you can see this particular searching experience could sort of talk about that it's trying to keep your experience that you already had on the left and give you a separate search experience but it's not working as you can tell so we want to make sure that we don't come up run into something like that.
prospect,i do understand.
rep,because we are doing desktop mobile and tablet we also want to make sure that we work with them so that's one number two is whenever we do the plug-in whoever installs the plugin there is some work that we need to do on our end to create these indexes that as i told you how do we solve gold plates is because we have to tune to you tune our solution to your catalogue so we have to do that work also so we need a little bit of a heads up on that and then the third thing is and i'm sure this will come up in some conversation is what is this going to cost so there are two fees one is one-time setup fee very simple not really expensive and second is the monthly fee the setup fee ranges from $500 to $1000 flat there's no change to it no matter how much work we have to end up doing and it all depends on how much work we do if if the agency is doing most of the work it might be closer to 500 if we are doing a lot of work it might be closer to the thousand dollars okay and the monthly fee varies based on two numbers how big your catalogue size is and how many people that come to your site.
prospect,okay if you can give me those two numbers i can also provide some some monthly fees for you.
prospect,let me get them to be on board .
rep,yeah absolutely.
prospect,no i don't think a one-time fee is gonna be an issue because if we're doing this one in do it right you know what i'm saying .
prospect,so let's get them on board yeah i wanna go and then we'll start giving back numbers and we'll talk a price okay.
rep,absolutly.
rep,what if i wanted to give you the world so you can make that call easily.
prospect,of course of course and again we'll work out something once the everyone's on board with the whole situation okay .
rep,absolutely totally fair.
prospect,all right cool we're fine thank you very much i gotta go yourself thank you very very much .
rep,thank you cal thank you rebecca really appreciate your the opportunity and please let us know if you have any questions or if you would like us to do this again .
prospect,okay perfect thank you again i look forward to your email so i can get back to you okay.
rep,awesome thank you okay very well thank you everything thanks guys.
prospect,fagin is fine yeah thank you .
rep,will you tell me how would you say .
prospect,well fabian is is okay yeah this is how are you say in english .
rep,no i know but you tell me how you say it in italy italian.
prospect,italian is a i mean it might be i'm french so it's actually fabian .
prospect,exactly .
rep,did i say that right fabian .
prospect,yeah yeah correct.
rep,awesome well a lot of people butcher my name to bob um so i just want to make sure i say yours make yours correctly .
prospect,no problem.
rep,okay all right awesome so let me know when you can see my screen please .
rep,and uh yeah to give you an idea of who we are where we come from and what we've done okay so what unboxd unbox is out of california bay area company and we have about 1200 customers globally 300 in the us we have a small presence in the europe for we have some presence in eastern europe i don't know if you've heard of emag have you heard of that company.
rep,it's one of the biggest e-commerce companies in eastern europe they are expanding rapidly into a lot of different countries we have some customers in in england and you know some customers in spain so mainly us and australia and asia some presence in europe and we have four unique differentiators we have solved a lot of problems with regards to product discovery and we have three distinct products in front of discovery so if you think about how do customers discover a products in your case products or activities right from from an activity perspective how do customers discover activities one is thickest search for it right second is they can navigate so they can navigate to a particular city just go down the list of categories and subcategories and third is these personalised product recommendation so unboxd actually does all three things for an e-commerce site if you think from a traditional e-commerce context and we also create custom solutions for all our retailers whether your enterprise class customer or a small specialty site and we have tremendous capabilities and scale in terms of in terms of infrastructure and we are extremely affordable and very competitive in our price point and because of this we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery.
rep,here's some of the big-name customers that we work with i know some of them may not make i may not mean anything to you but we have some really big global enterprise customers we also have worked with a lot of pure online retailers and we work on a lot of different platforms by the way what platform are you guys on.
prospect,the customise platform built in-house.
rep,all right so let's think about it from a perspective of how do customers discover products so what are the things that how customers may want to do it is through these banners so you certainly have cities on the homepage you have certain experiences these are probably what we call it your top sellers let's say or maybe your featured activities right but you might also want to show and slightly different elements based on how many times a customer has comment so you might want to show top sellers you might want to show feature sellers you might like you talked about you know there's a there's a new activity that has come in and you want to promote a new activity how do you create a merchandising element where your merchants and marketing team can control what activities show up on a flip side if you wanted to personalise the activities for the customer you definitely want to show recommend it for that particular customer based on the behaviour that that customer has right so those activities recently viewed you might want to show that the homepage so let's say for example saturday morning i'm looking at your sights you know kids come into the room things happen now i'm coming back to the site on sunday how can you get me back to those activities very quickly that i was looking at yesterday right center left type of recently viewed and personal and and make recommendations based on what i looked at yesterday when i come back to the homepage right there on the homepage and how do you influence that behavior then when i'm looking at a particular activity let's say i'm looking at the i'm assuming this is the oh this is in milan got it and i thought maybe this was the louvre but louvre is in the paris is so let's say i'm looking at this particular activity and you have related events either based on location right because if i'm going to milan am i staying in milan for a few days and do i want to do all the activities in milan or do i recommend other similar activities that might be in other cities in the same country right i don't know how customers buy from you or why do you buy from you and what that differentiator is that you know what type of typical customer comes in and buys from you or schedule these activities we can customise that solution accordingly but this is where the next set of influence would be where if i'm looking at this particular activity how can you recommend other stuff to me right could it be other similar stuff or other related stuff like okay i did the museum tour can i get a food tour for my evening plans for my dinner right or some sort of a cultural activity like a theatre or something in the evening that i can go to and or you might want to package it to say maybe there's a couple of activities that go together as a bundle say do this on saturday do this on sunday for local customers right and do you have a lot of local customers also it's or is just mainly tourists .
prospect,know and they like these local exhibitions like this one that you are on like exhibition palette so really like this they enjoyed because these are temporary events just for like four months yeah .
rep,exactly but they might want to make you might want to make it a day out of them right and you want to up sell and cross-sell other activities so let's say and and i'm just spitballing here say this activity takes a few hours during a day right so they could go in the afternoon spend a few hours now what can we give them as an activity for evening should we give them something i don't know do you have dining and stuff like that as well or it is just.
prospect,we do have some events in the evening like cooking classes or but we don't sell back down in restaurants and i mean it's more like touristic activity you know .
rep,got it maybe you can bundle it as a weekend package right and stuff like that so how do you decide on what to do you get to get the ability to create those types of widgets also now for automated stuff just to create cross selling opportunities you can do one related activities which can be automated through one box solution - you can do something like amazon stanwix as viewed also viewed right customer who viewed is also viewed this or bought also bought as some who bought this also bought this that kind of stuff next would be if i'm actually reserving a spot let's say 30 it's tour respond i'm assuming this is where i right now need to go in and pay so on the checkout page can i also suggest other cross activities right maybe you maybe you might have some sort of a bundle that okay we have this tour and maybe a different tour from somewhere else and you have a bundle package where you can give them a 10% discount 15% discount etc and you might want to suggest those types of activities as well so that's the idea of where you are checking out and how they can discover other activities that you can cross sell and provide those check out recommendations as well .
rep,now all of these that i talked about and let me just quickly show you what they might look like now our examples are coming from more of the e-commerce world just to give you an idea but this at least gives you a sense of what customisation we can do what we can look at and stuff like that okay.
rep,so here on the home page you can see we have hand-picked just for you so this is where the customer has actually seen specific products and we are showing them some sets of products based on three behaviours one is the user behaviour second is the product behaviour third is the collaborative behaviour so user behaviour is what type of products did this customer look at are the price sensitive are they category sensitive like do they like museums more than destinations like you know leaning tower of pisa etc and what is that activity that they're more bent towards and maybe their city specific right so those types of behaviors can be made specific next is product behaviour so this is where where is the customer coming from let's say we have some implicit information where the customer is coming from we know that maybe they are coming from milan and should we show milan specific activities and what other customers are viewing or trying to do and buying on the side that is more on the collaborative side of things your product behaviour would be what are your best seller best selling activities are in general right is it museum and the museum hopping is it is it destination is it locations etc so that's the idea behind handpick just for you the most complicated algorithm that we put out to make it personalized very one-to-one personalization there and this is in real time by the way if the customer changes their tastes location anything like that this will automatically start to make recommendations based on that as well.
rep,recently view view products this is again also personalised one-on-one but this is pretty straightforward you know it looks at all the products that a customer sees and starts showing those products with a customer in descending order now let's say i went into a particular product page how do i show other top-rated products smule also view and other recently viewed products some other recommending patients based on this are see these are some of our top sellers so we show what is really top selling on the site based on certain criteria that you can decide last week last two weeks this month etc if i'm clicking on a particular set of product how can i show some view also view products right if customers who viewed this also view this very automated but you also show products that might be part of a collection right and you can but in this particular case it's talking about other products from from a similar boutique and stuff like that or other similar products but that's the idea behind all these recommendations .
rep,okay let me show you one real quick one we also do recommendations in our search but i think your search might have different nuances to it so let's say i searched for a particular set of product and evaluating this particular product if i wanted to see more like these without going into the product detail page you can click on more like these shows you all shows you all the different products if you don't like them you can close it and you go back to your search experience .
rep,so thats essentially what we do fabia that makes a gives you an idea of what our product because is that something that you feel is applicable not applicable well.
prospect,i'm interested in knowing what's your what's your business model and how can we integrate your your functionalities .
rep,got it so it's very simple to integrate recommendations and i'll show you the business model is two sets of fees one is a setup fee if let's say you do all the work for setting it out there is no setup fee if you want us to do some of the work the setup fee ranges from say $500 to $700 one-time now from a the second key is the monthly fee because this is a sas product what we do is you give us a product feed right you can either give us a fee that you have your standard format or you can stand it as if to our format either way you upload the feed you do the analytics that's the second thing we need and then you basically can create all these widgets as div tags because these are all front end based integrations so let's say innovation you can basically give us a div tag right so let's say here if i go back to the home page you create a empty div tag right just like this an empty div tag and you put our javascript code on the page and i'll javascript will populate the right sets of products to show up and what the look and feel is can be customised to your site okay should we say hand pick just for you or should we say recommend it for you should we say we recommend this or you know how does the site museum rep use mint recommendations etc you can customise it to whatever you want it to look like and the products what you show you the product image title price whatever else that you want to show and easily easily easily shown on the product page okay.
rep,you can out of school there up to see multiple sets of products etc and that's it that's the integration the monthly fee for that depends on two pieces one is the number of products in your case the activity so you said it's roughly four thousand activities how many visitors do you get per month fabian.
prospect,around 400000 got it .
rep,so for our thousand roughly per month and i'm assuming there's some seasonality to it maybe more in the summer or less in the winter or no.
prospect,yeah it's true.
rep,yeah that's correct so maybe let's say average is five hundred thousand per month just to keep highs and lows is that fair.
prospect,um actually four hundred thousand is like high months.
rep,oh really okay so let's say maybe 350 or 300000 is your total average because what we look at phobia is your 12-month average so that you don't get you don't have to pay high amount for high season but still case some amount for the low season so we average it out looking at your past twelve months .
rep,okay so the monthly fee for let's say listen and you can give me a different number if it is less than say 300 thousand you could say 250 or something like that the fees can vary and we also give you a lot of room to grow by the way so let's say it is three hundred thousand and an average 12 months and four thousand products the recommendations monthly fee would be somewhere around five hundred dollars per month now there are ways to optimise this where you can sign a annual contracts and it can go down a little bit or you can prepay and you can go down a little bit all of that stuff is possible.
rep,now you can do you have ever i'm assuming because it's a homegrown solution you have a nice like it team.
rep,right yeah you basically have to say here's the analytics integration right it's like google analytics you just copy this tag in the header or the footer we increment so it will not affect the site performance you do product feed so either you can do a json xml or csv upload here's what the data looks like right basically a sample schema and you upload it and that's it and then to integrate the widget you basically can come in and say okay i can either call an api to get the actual products all the activities and you can decide to show however you want to show it or if you wanted to do it based on the front-end piece then your real quick using template editor so there's a front-end piece where you just copy/paste a div text i can i can just show you what the real life example looks like so let's just take and pick okay so here's the div tag right basically you give us a div tag put an id to it this might be a better example with me going here real quick and show you that this might be more on the front end okay so this is this is the div tag right you basically give us an empty div tag and we basically populate all the contents in it so that could be a front-end implementation a back-end implementation could be done using the api responses so you can control exactly do you want to show it horizontally or vertically if you want total control you can do it through the api option .
prospect,okay okay okay all right so yeah i mean how the look at this .
rep,fabia i will send you this link in the email so you have all the information to just go through it obviously if you have any questions let me know you can try out a product free for 30 days you know just to see how the performances 30 to 60 days if you're not happy you just cancel it and no cost to you if you want to continue then you can certainly pay the monthly fee .
prospect,okay and how and how long it takes to to integrate your your-your-your tool i mean you're .
rep,no more than couple of days a couple of weeks so i mean this is as easy as this right copy paste this script put it into the header yeah there's been an hour worth of job product feed if you were to standardize this in any format lets say here's what a sample feed looks like you can do it xml you can do json whatever up aspect and you just call to upload and that's it adjusting and then you can upload it as frequently as you want once a day twice a day etc right so this might take a day or day or two to do and then designing the widgets you already know exactly how your widgets are designed so let's say i go to this product page you already have the html in the design all you need is what products to show so integrating the api responses you just call the api you get json or xml response pretty standard and and that's it so let's see yeah so let's say you make an api call and here's the response you get it's like oh here's the product id title everything that you need to show can be available right .
rep,you just basically dump the results in the format that you want it can be vertical it could be horizontal yeah and then you it's done that's it that might take a couple of days so let's say five days to do coding integration etc another five days to do qa testing make any changes based on qa two weeks .
prospect,okay but like the place to put the the recommendations will be always the same because right now we're changing the layout of the pages let's say we.
rep,exactly a fabia that's exactly the reason i suggested the api so let's say right now it's on the right-hand side here tomorrow it might be here right at the bottom over here and it might be horizontal so you the api integration you are in total control because say three months four months from now you might want to change it again then you don't have to call unboxd to make any changes with the api approach you are in total control.
rep,so you're basically getting the response and you can decide to render it however you want to render let's say you're showing three today you might decide in to show four.
rep,right you don't have to ask unbox to come in you might want to add this scroll bar you actually have multiple so yeah i'm showing three here but you want to show nine you can add a scroll here to actually scroll left and right it'll like this one right you can see more results .
rep,right so that's the idea so you can be in total control if you were to do it out and that also gives you the benefit of not one having to pay a setup fee .
prospect,okay because api raishin is just and it i guess it takes also less time right .
rep,well it takes it doesn't take less or more time it just means that you are more in control and you can decide how to integrate and how not to integrate versus if it is done by unboxd let's say it's the front end integration like the div tag integration then unboxd isn't more control because will do all the work for you but then you can still decide how it's done what needs to be done it's just that we're more involved in doing the work for you.
rep,i'll give you an example let's say today your activities you can dump the data in a csv for example okay.
rep,it's a unbox standard format so you can say you know what i'll give you guys a a format that is our standard as amusment standard but there's work meat that needs to be done to standardize into unboxd standard we'll have to do that work we can do that work that is absolutely not a problem then second would be okay we have this i want to put a widget here called related events i want to put another widget here that's called we're also viewed i'm going to show three products and what is the ui are going to write so we can design the ui we can come up with some options we can convert it into html and then we can give you a div tag that regents just like a javascript you just place it on there and it will take care of rendering the results six months from now you come in and say oh i you know what i want to make it now vertical i don't want to make it horizontal we'll have to make the change again for you.
prospect,oaky okay.
rep,so that's that the only that's the only difference api puts you more in control if you don't want to do that because your team team is busy you want to quickly just get something done that's absolutely fair unboxd can also help we are more than willing to help and do this it's just that means there's a small fee to cover our cost .
prospect,okay right well that's clear thank you for these information .
rep,exactly the api integration by the way fabiana also gives you the control on email any of these widgets that you see here right recommendation recently viewed more like these beautiful bottles of walk all of those widgets you can make an api paul and put it into the email yourself so you're in total control of the e email as well .
prospect,okay so you can place these okay these mailchimp or how do they work.
rep,yeah so that's the only piece that we need to work with you mailchimp is not always open with third parties so it's be might be a problem but we have options with other isps and also we're working on our own ability to send emails .
prospect,okay yeah i mean if it's just a piece of code i don't know like we have to find a way to because for me emails are i mean short of email marketing and like the website i have to talk with more more people to integrate your solution.
rep,gotcha got it makes sense .
prospect,okay all right so yeah let me know and i'll be in touch .
rep,will do absolutely fabia so what i'm gonna do as a follow-up fabia is i'll put all of these links and information in an email i'll send it to you i also put in the pricing information based on the numbers you've given me if you think that the 12-month average is different just let me know so i can put more accurate cost and as peace is i don't know what timeline you're looking for this fabia is it right away is it you're just evaluating you're doing this for next year can you give me some guidance on that.
prospect,right now we are ready to to test some solution so i mean it's just a matter of finding the right one and of course if we can test for free it's nice so.
rep,yeah absolutely 60 days free no problem and just let us know now the only the only piece that we would request you help us with is the implementation cost that's .
prospect,all discuss your in more details .
rep,yeah absolutely if we do the implementation if you are doing the implementation there is no cost either .
rep,okay right it's it's it's totally free for 60 days .
prospect,yeah i guess we can do it in-house depends on the amount of work.
rep,yeah absolutely totally understand so if you also fabia if let's say the in-house it team is saying let's we'll do the work we just need some quick rundown of what needs to be done right so rather than them reading 20 pages or hundred pages of documentation we can bring your technical team and our technical team on a call you can very quickly walk them through all the different elements of how they can quickly integrate and what is it that they need to really focus on .
rep,okay so we can also do that to just make sure you know they might come in say oh look this is how our data looks like this is what our csu our catalog looks like this is how we getintegrate so we can quickly point them and say this is what you need to look at these are the ten pages you need to worry about it ignore everything else.
rep,so that makes it much faster for them and it's much more narrowed focused for the focus for them as well .
rep,all right and so fabia if let's say i send this all all to you what how much time do you want us to wait and reach out to you.
prospect,i mean we'll still be doing a few few solutions of course we need we need to discuss internally and understand what's the best for us so you guys at least a weekl.
rep,yeah absolutely no problem so maybe thursday or friday of next week we'll try to reach out again if you haven't heard back from you by then.
rep,is that fair.
rep,okay awesome well fantastic if you have any questions that i did not answer for you.
prospect,no it's fine for now.
prospect,okay sounds good .
rep,thank you thank you thank you for the opportunity fabia i really appreciate it.
prospect,yeah have a good weekend.
rep,thank you sir thanks.
prospect,for you that has more history on on a deal and all that but i work in a simple thing an advisory group within cerberus they're not the guys that are off making the fields but the point of difference is silly to advise the portfolio companies that we invest in to hopefully add some value be there as someone that's kind of placed in to a portfolio company or someone that should kind of bear on an advisement basis so that is my engagement currently with avon and i'm assisting a couple others in a lot of marketing and sales and strategy projects that are ongoing and i've been spending a lot of time there there's some background noise that you or me.
rep,i'm not sure i'd can you hear me all right there.
prospect,yeah i go you don't you all right.
prospect,okay good i'll just keep going then um anyway i'm i've been recently engaged in avon and have been spending a lot of time on the various sites of commerce site just avon dot com and then also the web portals probably you know just chanced upon your product.
prospect,so keen to see what you guys have but does that give you an overview the helpful.
rep,yes absolutely thanks a lot for all that information and you know so so to the agenda for the call that we had you know was to kind of give you a quick rundown you know give you some background and unbxd and who we are and what we do and we also like you requested it put together a a commerce search study where we essentially try to replicate the product discovery experience via shopper and and try to see how you know how well you search functions today and kind of you know also call out some of the opportunities that we see coming in from the outside and and and lastly i'd also like to spend a few minutes to kind of talk to you about our technology itself and show you some customer examples in terms do something some of the challenges that we've helped potentially solved and discuss next steps if any does that sounds like a good agenda or there anything in specific that you'd like to add.
prospect,no that sounds great.
rep,perfect then and right before i could jump in paige also i noticed you came to the site you requested for a commerce search study report was there something in particular you were looking for something that piqued your interest that that you wanted to make sure we cover on this call today.
prospect,nothing in particular we just came to understand the tools and the insights that you guys might be able to close oh i'm an open book and i'm trying to eager to see what you've been able to uncover.
rep,absolutely so just to give you a quick background and unbxd so we're a 7 year old company founded out of the bay area we are headquartered in mountain view california and so we roughly work with about 1200 local e-commerce websites most of our business it's here in the united states but we are also rapidly expanding into europe and asia and what we do is we're a product discovery company and and what that means is we apply advanced data sciences and machine learning to help connect your shoppers to the products they are most likely to buy. so you know our technology understands shopper intent and one makes it easier for your shoppers to find the products they are looking for and so we're also able to optimise that overall product discovery experience. now you know so so just a kind of call out you know so if you notice on the slide that i've put up yours we've seen success in multiple verticals so fashion it's been a good spot we work with express dot com route 21 we've also seen some success with the home improvements based we work with ashley home store bed bath & beyond that we've just started working with we also just signed up with hsn a top ir 100 company we seem success and grow 3 with fresh direct we've also seen some success in the b2b space with ip supply us auto parts one of the largest auto pod retail in the us etc and we also work with a couple of small to medium sized beauty and cosmetic retailers like deborah lippmann is one of them we also work with bh cosmetics. and and the one thing i also actually call that is units a1 we are platform agnostic so we could essentially function either with you know something that you've custom build or a homegrown e-commerce platform or.
rep,even a third-party foot platform like like atg hybris shopify magento any of those platforms as well.
rep,and the other piece is also you know one of the reasons we've seen success with all of these verticals of guilt is yeah i like some of our competitors the one key thing is our technology is ai driven and it's based on machine learning so while you know some of the other competitors can do really well in a fashion in a parallel space or or maybe a home improvement space something that we've specifically done is we also you know our technology is built to self learn from your product catalog as well.
rep,and kind of understand your user behaviour and optimise that discovery experience.
rep,and so it's a couple of different components that we cover from a product discovery standpoint is one of course is the site search that is our core products where we fix for things like relevancy user behaviour synonyms stemmed word etc we also cover category pages so you know and for the shoppers that don't necessarily use the site search in your sites today let's say if if they come and <> and browse were also able to personalise that experience and lastly is the product recommendations where where we're able to understand consumer behaviour past buying behaviour etc unable to recommend products that's most likely relevant in and help them make that purchase.
prospect,great and you're launching you know and anything.
rep,sorry i was that a question.
prospect,looks like launching you new one which is exciting as well
rep,great right yeah so we're coming up with any email recommendations to let's that's scheduled for q3 and we'll stop beat a testing at some time sometime soon.
prospect,mmm-hmm .
rep,and yes a moving into you know so right before i can move into the customer experience study we've put together avon dot com so here's an example of express where before unbxd so you know clearly that was a challenge let's say somebody were to search for blue jeans the results they were getting was very different and after unbxd you'd see that the results are a lot more relevant.
rep,so you know from a search standpoint it's important because we see there's a huge potential for conversions and you know i'd be talking about more examples and express but you know express alone was able to see a huge impact on their conversion rates post implementing unbxd.
rep,and yes any questions before i could jump into the custom experienced area page.
prospect,no please go ahead.
rep,perfect so uh so what we did is we kind of audited the site search for avon dot com from you know across five key elements as far as such site search is concerned so one we looked at the search relevancy to see you know what what kind of results we get if somebody has to come in and search on your site to we also looked at your auto suggest or the type of head functionality to see if it's you know assisting or guiding the shopper to narrow down and get to that product they're looking for next we also audited your site across synonyms in stemmed words and and also from you know to see how we site search responds if someone were to misspell a particular search query from an error tolerance standpoint.
rep,and lastly all of the above you know or all of the other components from a mobile standpoint to see how you search response you know on a mobile device right.
rep,so from a search relevancy standpoint so some you know - here's an instance where we audited your site with with a product called sun care or products around sun care.
rep,and i think we what we noticed is you know a lot of results that came up from a search standpoint that's to the left were not very relevant whereas you know we wanted to make sure the products are available to navigation we go through navigation we were able to filter down to products that are relevant to you know sun care products.
prospect,okay make sense.
rep,secondly here's an instance where we looked at a specific query called you know we look for perfume on your site and again so here is another instance where the products that showed up i think there was perfume mention on on the product description which could be one of the reasons why it showed up but it would clearly house perfume is what you do have perfumes available on the site.
prospect,yeah there's a lot of area for improvement area so there's not surprised to see this.
rep,alright and and just curious page so do you know you know do you have a what how important is site search for avon do you have a lot of shoppers coming in and using the search functionality.
rep,so well i don't know if you're familiar with avon business at all but most of the sales are not coming through it's only 5% are coming for avon dot com most sales are coming through reps that have a customer base so i would say it's a growing priority knowing that we need to be attracting customers shopping online but to date it hasn't been a huge priority or focus if you can believe it it was actually worse than this before and we've brought in a search agency to help improve the performance but clearly there's still more work to be done.
prospect,so i think it's just kind of over going you know evolvement i would say.
rep,got it and and is there a specific technology that you're leveraging for search do you know like solar elasticsearch.
prospect,i'm sure about that i can't give you an answer but i can follow up i don't know it off the top of my head i haven't been close to that work stream.
rep,sure no worries at all so y'all have good information so moving on you know so here's here's an instance where we tried you know putting in a feature to a specific query so we tried to sensitive skin and eye care and again clearly the results that we got were very different from what's available from a navigation standpoint again here's an instance where we look for shimmer lips well we got one relevant result here so it look like the result was relevant but it only showed me one product while there are many more products available when we looked through the navigation page.
prospect,right yeah it's just kind of basic stuff that we should be doing honestly.
rep,all right and and you know so one of the things you know that we've noticed with many retailers that we speak where it is so you know in order for you to fix some of these it's more of a manual process where you go back to your analytics look at you know what your queries are and what kind of queries people are searching with and kind of go back go back to your system and it involves a lot of time and efforts to to kind of make some of these changes so one of the different shades with unbxd we were able to help solve you know most of this out of the box where where we kind of eliminate that need for you to you know put in time and effort and go back manually not synonyms etc.
prospect,yeah make sense.
rep,and yeah so the other piece that we looked at with you ought to suggest that this we you know we find to be a critical piece from a site search standpoint just because it's the first interaction that your shopper has when they try to look for a product using the search tab and something that we notice this while you do offer some sort of an autocomplete it's it's not really helping the shopper narrow down to the product they are looking for.
rep,and you kind of you know take a minute here to show you some of the auto auto suggest functionalities that we've built for some of our customers now some of these sites that i'm going to show you might be very different from you know the vertical your end and in very different shopper behaviour altogether but the idea of showing you some of these is just to show you the level of customisation we were able to offer.
rep,and and and make sure that you know we're able to kind of tune it to the kind of experience you want to have you have for your shoppers so here's an instance in express dot com so let's say if i on on express dot com a type in jeans so what you'd notice here is one the autosuggest is very visual in nature and this is something that we've that we find important especially in the fashion and aerospace week and it's important to kind of keep the customers engaged right so we've we've made it very visual the second piece is you know so when somebody looks for a generic term like jeans it could mean you know a multiple of different things it could be jeans for men it could be jeans for women then it could be potentially looking for jeans in a specific style so layout that we built out for them is essentially where we you know kind of as you hover over to the various options one they're able to kind of narrow down to the specific product that they could possibly be looking for.
rep,so they are women men.
rep,sorry come again.
rep,sorry this is the functionality that you said can sit on top of any platform or site setup that we currently have in site correct how does that works on the back end i guess.
rep,that's correct so on the back end well yeah so you know in terms of the platform you know we definitely platform agnostic so there are a couple of different ways that we could kind of implement the solution per sale so the easiest way that we've you know for instance in express dot com what we've done is an in page ajax approach where all they had to do is kind of give us you know the header and footer with a page and all of the results including your to suggest would be rendered you know by unbxd so it's very little effort in your ends and you know most of the conflicts are are built by our team.
rep,and even in terms of the ux and ui so we could you know make some recommendations as far as you know template goes you know just because this is something that works for express it does not necessarily have to be the same for a avon dot com so let's assume you want something different for your business you know you know we can tale it to the kind of experience that you want to have for your customers.
prospect,right okay yeah i mean i've seen a lot of this functionality on other retailers tyson there's i mean just as a consumer it makes a big difference so i'd imagine that the metric for fresh and some of your other clients are much improved functionality.
rep,yes absolutely and i'll kind of walk you walk you through some of those success stories as well and and the one other piece to the auto suggest it's you know it's one of you notice we also have a personalization confidence to it where we show you know so let's say i'm coming in from mountain view california and i'm looking for jeans and maybe gray jeans is popular in this region so i would see gray jeans and the different styles that's available in gray but i think we are in new york and you know maybe blue jeans is more popular in new york with which blue jeans as an option here where you could kind of narrow down to see that piece as well.
prospect,that's really interesting and how are you and.
rep,i'm sorry can you repeat that question.
prospect,how are you aggregating my data is that based on express dot com or.
rep,yeah we have multiple data and we kind of go through the click through data we go throughout add to carts what's most popular in a specific region etc and we kind of are even even perhaps let's say if you have reviews for a particular product and you know you want to show products that have you know the best reviews so we're able to track all that data take that into account in and displayed as per the most popular ones.
prospect,oh great well.
rep,hey justin i just wanted to chime in there page there's two parts of the data that you asked one is the data that we collect using the click stream of the user behaviour on the website we do not mix the data though i just want it to be clear on that it's not like expresses data empower avon site or vice-versa it is your data and we circulate within that data however.
prospect,there is no syncing .
rep,absolutely but there is a second component of the data that we do incorporate that is what we call is the web data so we have scanned almost 100000 e-commerce sites we do have markers and we used with third parties and stuff where we collect third party data to try to help influence how the algorithm makes decisions.
rep,but that's a more anonymized general data like weather pattern social patterns etc.
rep,to try to figure out what should be influenced but between retailers we don't mix the data either.
rep,thanks monal and also to show you one of the customer examples so this is a grocer side and again it's very different from the vertical that you're in but i just want to show you the level of customisation that's possible.
rep,so this is with big basket it's one of the largest eat grossest in southeast asia and the layout that we built for them is let's say if i were to search for something like a bread so what we noticed you know the typical behaviour and group in the grocery spaces is one there are consumers buying multiple products 20 30 products in one transaction and to at least get 60 to 70 percents of various repeats repeat orders you know yuri stacking up your grocery on a monthly or weekly basis and so what we did for them is so let's say if i were to search for bread if you notice so it lists down the various varieties of bread that's available but also gives you you know the quantity the price the option to change the quantity and add to cart right from the search box itself.
rep,so this kind of significantly would help to reduce the number of clicks that's taken in order for a shopper to to basically make the purchase where where the clicks used to be around 100 hundred and fifty four transaction we were able to bring it down significantly and and help help help unfreeze their average order values as well.
rep,mm-hmm and and i don't know if it's you know similar behaviour with avon do you have you know a lot of customers coming in and buying you know similar products or repeat product so that's something that you've noticed a new site as well.
prospect,<> probably not as much as a grocery retailer.
rep,sure does that make a sense.
prospect,definitely.
rep,that's okay.
rep,justin one one quick question page for you the when you had mentioned earlier that you know customers you'll get only 5% of your sales online most of it is through the reps do the reps how do the reps order inventory do they have a different portal or do they go to the same site.
prospect,yeah they have a different portal.
prospect,product and they can almost like order it online i mean order it over the phone.
rep,i see so on the different portal maybe something to consider where because they are ordering pretty much some very similar products again and again most of the time a similar experience could really help them also because it reduces and cuts down in terms of that discovery path but they might have to take.
prospect,yeah absolutely it will be fine web portal is might see consumer facing e-commerce site so there's a lot of work to be done there and could definitely see the technology will be helpful we have a lot of work to do on that site well .
rep,yeah absolutely and i think that you know using the same technology you can power both the rep portal and the consumer portal so you don't have to necessarily build two different distinct technologies but have distinct experiences using the same technology.
prospect,got it make sense.
rep,all right thanks monal and moving on to the customer experience study so the next piece that we also kind of looked at in your site is to see how you site such response to maybe you know somebody was to look for a synonym of a specific product and in this instance we tried deodorant versus antiperspirant and you know we got the right results so this was an instance where it worked we looked at some stemming detection to see you know in a night cream versus over night cream well again the results were well somewhat different from you know the product that are available from a navigation standpoint versus but what showed up from the search.
rep,we looked at our error correction so here's an instance where we misspelled the word hypoallergenic moisturisers and while we got a couple of relevant results i suppose i think there are again several more product that's available when we go and navigate to this particular category.
rep,and so so while i'm on this piece page i just had a quick question on you know do you know how some of this is getting fixed today let's say you notice that there was a you know top query being misspelled did you have to create a manual synonym them on the back end do you have any details around them.
prospect,i don't personally i know there were some changes that they were looking to make but i think a lot of things unfortunately have been identified and then backlog.
rep,well.
prospect,i don't know i don't know on this type of initiative i know that it was something that has been identified so it's not a great answer but i guess we're working on though so.
rep,totally and i guess that's one of the reasons why you're talking to us as well so that makes perfect sense.
rep,and the last piece is in mobile where you know we found that from a usability standpoint the search bar is easy to locate and comfortable to use but from from a relevancy standpoint we noticed it's pretty much the same result where you know both from stemmed words synonyms etc it was it was similar pattern that we noticed on mobile as well.
rep,and oh yeah so you know so just to give you you know this is summarised you know the study i'll sent over the reports to you anyway so you can share it with your team and you know kind of fastest long but but scott the summer the summer your fear is you know one yet clearly you have thousands of skus on the site you have you know people you know searching in you know in a multitude of different ways and and clearly you know if you have a manual process today in place to kind of fix some of these it's not very scalable and you know that's really where the technology piece comes into picture where unbxd technology is able to identify user behaviour we're also able to you know we also have built the technology and algorithms to understand natural language and and it's able to show relevant results.
rep,and the next piece i wanted to.
rep,sorry go ahead.
prospect,no i didn't have anything to go ahead.
rep,sure so the next thing i wanted to kind of walk you through is also from a technology standpoint kind of give you you know why unbxd and and where we differentiate ourselves again to move you know the other competitors out there in the market so what we've seen is you know most search technologies that's available in the markets today you know do a simple text pattern match and that's based off of an algorithm that was you know search algorithm that was coined there were a couple of decades ago.
rep,and if you notice that's an outdated technique because let's say you know here's an instance where i look for women's white jeans typically you know our search technology would do in anding on an or-ing which means it would do it would it would break down the query into three words and search for women's or white or jeans where you show you know a lot of products and which would include a lot of irrelevant products as well or it would do an ending which would include women's and white and jeans and and that would show way to you know very few products it would only show products which has the exact three keywords and that's kind of hard you know to get results a lot of results around that as well.
rep,and how we've solved for this problem is one like you know monal mentioned we've kind of index our catalogue begins you know several thousand catalogues that we call the world catalogue and our technology understands one what the product is and to what the product attributes are and we assign something called as a relevancy game which is which essentially helps you know improve relevancy to a large extent so in this instance the i the tf-idf is the although algorithm which which a lot of such technologies use and if you see here so let's say the example of women's white jeans you would notice that the highest way to design this to women the second highest is to white and and the lowest is to jeans and it technically should be the other way around where jeans is the product from an e-commerce standpoint and and you want to be able to show the right product so using our algorithm what unbxd has been able to do is assign another rated which on top of it which basically assigns the highest weight edge to the product which is jeans and then to the attributes which is women's and white.
rep,and so well you know so you know while that's the technology allows also like to kind of show you some quick examples on express.com so let's say somebody looking for something very specific let's say a white sleeveless top for instance so there's a long tail query where you know the search queries you know this is this is a consumer who's looking for a very specific product and you notice that all of the results are white sleeveless tops .
rep,similarly fletcher that's right been great jeans let's see if this one works so yes it's able to pick out all the jeans that are green color from the catalog and is able to show the results.
rep,right and the second piece too you know the relevancy game is understanding the user behaviours of would like like i only mentioned what we also take into account is you know your product click-through rates your add to carts we find out what products are being bought the most what products have the highest reviews and we were able to place those products up top when somebody searches for a particular product.
rep,so that ways you have the best product and the most relevant product showing up in the search results.
rep,and the next piece is specific to the synonyms and spellcheck you know like i mentioned so in most cases it's it's mostly a manual efforts to go back identify that you know that there's a query that's not working and and to go back and build a synonym for that but unbxd been able to do is with respect to synonyms and stemmed words we were able to solve solve for it 90% of the times and that's out of the box without you really having to build out anything on the back end and similarly for spell check or spelling mistakes we were able to solve for it 85% of the times out of the box again without you having to put in any manual effort .
prospect,that's great.
rep,so yeah just just gotta show you a couple of examples around that piece let's say if i were to type in white tees so if you notice i get up 165 results and what we're able to do is we understand that t-shirts and tees to mean the same thing from an e-commerce context so let's say i go back i can type in four white t-shirts you'd see that the same set of products show up again and let's say i look for i misspell a query here so we can correct up to four four words in a search query so let's say here's an instance where i misspelled black leather jacket for instance l-e-a-t-h-e j-k-t so i've misspelled all the three words but the technology is able to identify the query and it's able to show the relevant results right from the word go.
prospect,so that's from you know a search standpoint and monal you also want to kind of talk talk about some of this you know facets and filter options which are dynamic in nature that unbxd can help with.
prospect,um sure.
rep,go ahead.
rep,yeah so why don't you go to the page it's a few down yep so page here what the difference is let's say today because you have so many different categories of products so you might have perfumes versus lotion versus skin care etc the idea behind that is different categories of products customers like to narrow them down using different facets or filters so on the category pages it's easy to do that because you have a very well defined product result set and but in search it becomes even trickier because i can search for that category of products in a hundred different ways so you cannot manually go in and start to assign that's specific facets or filters for every single permutation and combination of a query right.
rep,so i'll give you a simple example let's say we talk about shoes so on shoes as a category you can come in and say i want to show size ankle height width shoe type etc in that order but i can search for shoes in a thousand different ways so i could search for shoes they have choose and choose men's casual shoes right you cannot go in and set this manually for every single variation so this is something unbxd solved where you set it up once for the category unbxd will automatically scale that to no matter how the customer can search for that category.
rep,so that's a big problem today where otherwise what will happen is your search results that will have a very generic order of how the movement right and with all this is the same so if you want to have a different want to have it optimise different category.
rep,monal you still online think we lost you.
rep,i think we lost them well yeah so so yeah i think the overall gist if you know what monal is trying to explain is you know in terms of you know the facets and filters we want to make it as dynamic as possible so that ways you know if let's say somebody's not using search on your site but it's instead coming and browsing for a particular product you want to help them narrow down using filters to the specific product that they're looking for and you want to show filters up top that are most relevant to nature.
prospect,yeah this is great.
rep,alright and yeah i also wanted to kind of take a minute to kind of walk you through some of our customer success stories so just see here.
rep,yes you know so i showed you a few examples from express dot com so you know express was able to increase their such conversions by over 18% and similarly with iv supply we saw an increase in their such conversions by 22% and iv supplies is it's a b2b retailer.
rep,so for some of you know the other portal that you were talking about where you know that's not  b2c well you know we can tie in a lot of things that we've done for iv supplies and i think you know that assume that a lot of behaviours similar just just in terms of people buying repeat products etc right.
rep,and so we've got to seen this impact across you know most you know across all for customers in fact that we work with so in the grocery space fresh direct 26% express routes funny one liquidation channel and you know so something that we have in place also when you you know when you talk about this internally is a poc model page where we come in we do a quick poc for about 60 to 90 days where well it we let you try out the solution and what we guarantee in that sixty to ninety days is a minimum of five to ten percent improvement in in conversions and that's on contract .
rep,right so while while while you notice that it's typically a lot higher than you know the 10% but 10% is something that we can guarantee and we are confident about and that's what we put on paper and if you don't see the uptake in conversions you're free to walk away with no questions asked.
prospect,great okay yeah awesome.
rep,so any questions and you know any of the things that we covered so far peige.
prospect,so it's pretty clear in it i mean obviously the results speak for themselves i'd love to take this back to the rest of the team and share it with them and then kind of go from there i need to talk to the owners of areas and you know kind of get the latest on what they're doing and what progress takes and it just makes me i'm a little bit removed like i said so very informative and i really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through it.
rep,right and the one piece that i dint really touch on you know is our merchandising dashboard so while you know we've really built out this cool technology the algorithms to kind of you know prioritise and show popular products etc we also understand that you know merchants understand their business better right so we also give control to merchandisers to be able to go in and let's say there's a specific brand that you want to boost you have a specific campaign running and you want to show those products up top we're able to give you all of that control but very slick ui you know where you really don't involve any it or engineering efforts to be able to boost products or pin product slots etc.
rep,so there's another piece that you know that's that's really interesting to a lot of merchandisers just because it gives them the control and they're able to drive what's best for the business.
prospect,great yeah that's really that's really helpful so good to know that.
rep,perfect and you know the second piece is also from a product recommendation standpoint you know we're we have a widget strategy where we have all of the widgets that's available on amazon.com today so if you're looking to cross-sell and upsell on your site we have all of you know the widgets saying the adolfo bude bottles about top up sellers etc.
rep,so so yeah.
rep,that's pretty much of what the product looks like and what our solution covers and yeah so what we suggest as an ideal next step pieg i know you mentioned you have to discuss this internally but what would you what would you say you know would you like us to follow up with you in a week's time to to see where you are and.
prospect,yeah absolutely i think that's a great nice job.
rep,okay perfect so well represented you know the customer experience study i'll also share with you some of the case studies and webinars that we've hosted with some of our customers you know not just talking about the technology but also the improvement and conversions that they've seen so that ways you're able to go back to the business and kind of help which will help help you build a case.
prospect,perfect yeah that's exactly what i need okay great thank you so much.
rep,thanks paige and monal i don't know if you're still on did you have any other questions for paige.
rep,um no i apologize and my internet got chopped off and i got disconnected no but i'm good unless paige's any questions that we could answer paige for you.
rep,alright thanks thanks for your time paige it was really nice talking to you and we look forward to hearing from your next steps have a great.
prospect,ok great thank you and have a good weekend.
rep,take care.
rep,right bye now.
rep,awesome so here's what we were talking about the analysis that we did on petsmart dot come by the way annette can you give us a little bit of background regarding you because i was trying to find you on linkedin and the only on it i found with a unique last name that you have was somebody from qvc is that you or i don't know.
prospect,yes its me ya.
rep,yeah that is you so is petsmart  is the division of qvc now or.
prospect,no i had left qvc.
rep,got it this not updated .
prospect,okay its not been updated  here for long yeah.
rep,got it no problem fantastic okay so give me a little bit of background and that because we have no idea and congratulations by the way the move.
prospect,so what do you need background on i'm sorry.
rep,i just you just what are you doing petsmart what what's the role is what you manage etc.
prospect,so my role i oversee the digital merchandising planning and business optimization team so basically were responsible for what goes on the website how its plans inventory and the optimization of the site.
rep,perfect alright awesome so it gives me good context in terms of what specific things that we have that can help you and your team and i can focus on that as well so alright so let's get into on both as i was mentioning to you we have about 400 plus customers right here in the us as you can see some of them are right here actually express you also work with bed bath & beyond we just started working with hsn dot com about two weeks ago as well so we've been growing tremendously grew almost 6x compared to 2015 last year and this year we are poised to grow at least four times compared to last year so we've been growing tremendously quickly and very excited to talk to you today so here's the analysis that we've done we looked at specifically on site search so what unbxd does is product discovery for e-commerce what product discovery includes is your category pages site search and product recommendations on any e-commerce site the ways a customer can discover products on any commerce site.
rep,and we specifically focused narrowly focused on site search but i also have something to show you on yours category pages since you mention about merchandising and what shows product assortment on the site is set up so when we talk about site search there are six components that are extremely important to look at the experience from site search perspective so what do you by the way just out of curiosity what do you guys use today for site search with a homeground tool or inbecka something of that.
prospect,we use my advice.
rep,oh my advice got it okay so when we started looking at the site and i searched for say bird grooming or if i look at say bird care this is what i start seeing i start seeing pet care cat care etc type of search results and it's actually a redirect but when i actually go through the category pages there is a burn grooming set category that you guys have created right .
rep,if i now say i'm sorry was that a question.
rep,let's say i searched for cat mats or mats for cats and this is what i get for search results about 73 but these are not mats or liners for cat but when i go to the navigation through the navigation there's a clear category called mats and liners for cats canned puppy food i'll actually see something totally different versus canned food for puppies if i search for say natural dog bones actually see again some food but then there's a bones then rawhide for dogs and then you also have a filter called natural so from that perspective you can see here what this is telling us and then is when the customer is searching on your site a lot of times you're not getting good relevant results and what might be happening today if you look at your analytics is three or four things might be happening today one is which are indicated that search is not working number one is whatever your overall site conversion is compared to your site search conversion site search conversion should be three times or four times your site conversion if it is not your search is not optimized second is you might did you guys use use amateur google analytics for.
rep,is it amateur is that.
rep,okay so within amateur or even google analytics if you used that the what will happen is let's say i search for natural dog bones i won't get good results so i'll now go and navigate i'll find the category i'm looking for and i end up buying the product what your analytics team thinks analytics tool is tell you is that that query or search is performing great that you had that search session had a conversion which is true but misleading.
rep,yes i searched in that session and i bought in that session but the two are not correlated and a lot of times customers will not necessarily take the time or care to actually go through and navigate the reason they were searching is because they wanted to get there quickly they didn't want to spend a lot of time and get in and get out right and your is that the experience that you have do you guys get feedback either internally or through customers that search is not working or there's some opportunity there to improve search.
prospect,not really .
rep,hmm ok so do you guys do you have a team that manages search or.
prospect,i do i have team to manage search.
rep,you'r the person.
rep,got it and you know like spelling mistakes or stuff like that do you guys have to spend a lot of manual time to manage search.
prospect,so yes we do all of that.
rep,got it so as you can see there are specific queries that aren't working and the second piece that we also started to get into is the auto suggests so here you can see when i start to search for say draw a dog treat so even when i was starting to let's say go and just search for say bird you can see here i i see birds and then bird baths right now this is a problem because you have so many bird products and what is it not giving the customer is the ability and the feedback to go forward so here you want to tell the customer that hey you know what we have all these products but all these categories you are on the right path and i'll show you some examples of how we do it with others of some other customers .
rep,and you also want to guide them there's just not bird and bird baths as to products that we have on the catalogs you have lots more products from that perspective let's say i started to search for say dog so that's a dog dwars treats dog for dogs i'm not sure what that is maybe it's a toy dog for dogs and dog flea and tick.
rep,so while these might be some of the popular products are being sold i may not have this really comes from one of the popular products so that's the idea it does not necessarily reflect what everything that you have in the catalog for your customers and now you obviously cannot dump the entire catalog in front of them either.
rep,so you have to guide them so let me show you just different examples and i'm going to show you a net different types of verticals to give you an idea the versatility of our approach and what how differently we think about trying to solve this little problem so here's parts warehouse absolutely nothing to do with the vertical you're in but i wanted to give you give you an idea here.
rep,they have two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another user who has no idea what parts to buy and they sell parts for appliances so i know the model of the appliance that i have so what they used to do is have two search boxes one for use it one for parts and one for models we obviously came in and said you came to have two search boxes one because you are putting the onus on the - what is the picture on search box and three you can only optimise one search box at a time so here what we came in and there was if i start to search for let's say bissel we segmented the autocomplete into two two sides on the left hand side you can see parts the most popular parts that you have and on the right hand side you have the most popular bissel models so this gives the customer the feedback to say you're on the right path just keep giving us more information as long as you don't see what you're looking for here and then we also give them top searches for products that you said customers usually like to buy or top searches that customers usually like to search for.
rep,a completely different example this is expressed as a vertical so here i'm just going to search for let's say jeans and you can see here in apparel you want the customer to get visually engaged you want to capture the customers attention very quickly so large images and a lot of information around it but then we also provide guidance to the customer and you can see here as soon as i hover over any of these details maybe i'm looking for jeans for men i can very quickly get here and navigate down and narrow it down to specifically what i'm looking for so this way i'm also guiding the customer down and then we also provide some popular queries all right.
rep,and it's all machine learning so let's see if i were just now search for say dressed you can see that i have dressed only for women whereas when jeans was there was for a woman and man and i'll show you the last part and maybe this might be interesting to you because i'm assuming that a lot of customers come to petsmart and repeat purchases would that be a correct assumption.
rep,restocking <> food etc right
rep,so same thing is true for grocery it's fantastic so same thing is true for grocery where you buy a lot of products that you bought last week or two weeks ago right you simply didn't buy the same products again at the end so here the way we try to create the exam the experience was let's say i search for bread and you can see here if i'm going to show you the most popular breads what the weight is price is qua- you can change the quantity and add to cart from right here.
rep,so if a customer comes in and is looking to buy that dog food you can show that dog food right up top they get add to cart from right here and get in and get out from the autocomplete they don't even have to go to the search results and we also show some commonly searched terms popular brands and some categories and this is true for any category that you look for let's see if i were to search for say chicken the .
rep,other thing that we also do by the way annette is we personalize this to an individual level so let's say for example i am i like chicken and i buy the chicken masala all the time versus you buy say a chicken leg without skin all the time so for the same query chicken you will see your product up top i will see my product up top.
rep,is this is this something along the lines of what you are thinking and that could this be helpful to to your to change your customers or are we .
prospect,yes that's a big basket i would want to know more about did they convert at that level or did they still want to go and see the product and then add it in.
rep,got it so two two types of behaviour that's a great question so two types of behaviour what happens is when i type in chicken and let's say let's say turkey took you the grated now let's see if i was searching for turkey if you also work with by the way fresh director of new york we just started working with them we still haven't done the autocomplete for them yet but we already power their search results the idea behind that is if i'm searching for turkey and usually you buy the let's say the sliced turkey or the packaged turkey but during thanks giving you actually want to buy the whole turkey right so normally you'll see your sliced turkey up here i mean that's what converts really well but during thanksgiving they would actually click on the right hand side over here because that's what they are actually looking for and that's not necessarily popular within what their historical basket looks like.
rep,so they'll go in here and then they'll look at the search results and then go and convert from what they found so for typically what we see is 30 to 40 products get bought in a single transaction some grocery and 25 of them out of those so 25 or 30 or about 35 out of 40 are usually repeat purchases so they typically come in and just quickly add to cart from right here versus for those out-of-the-box products or products as in don't normally buy oh just because i have a get-together this weekend people are coming at the house etc right i'm gonna go off and buy some other products and.
rep,that's when out of the popular products you don't like them it's something you use customers usually go and either click on these or you just hit enter onto the keyword and look at the search results so roughly 80% is what converts through the order copy and we give you the ability to track that by the way.
rep,let me show you so this is what our dashboard looks like our back-end dashboard and you can see from the past right from the top level let me give you an executive overview of the past few weeks how many search queries did you get how many product we use did you get add to carts products sold revenue per search visit and four queries right but you also get the ability to drill down you get the ability to look at the individual reporting to say i want to see report trends based on card orders conversion rate versus query hits versus clicks based on daily weekly monthly or i can also see funnel i can see my top search queries top zero results queries top clicked products top ordered products and i can also see individual query performance so this is also something becomes really important and that because let's say try to find two examples okay perfect so let's see here's leggings as an example okay you can see here leggings has about 4000 roughly hits 62% ctr which is 62 percent click-through rate and as a conversion rate of 11 point 18 but you can see here bodysuit yeah i know what happened but.
prospect,hello .
rep,yeah i can i can still hear you can you do me yep all right i think actually clicked on something there we go so i showed you leggings which had 11 point 18 percent in conversion rate and 62 percent ctr right now if you look at bodysuit here bodysuit is roughly 65 percent ctr but only four point one seven in conversion rate so this gives you an idea to say hey it's not just necessarily search so key customers are clicking on the search results the search results are good but maybe the pdp doesn't have enough details maybe the pricing has changed there's something else going on there's a hurdle to what the or maybe it's not a great product or product assortment that you have which is why the conversion rates are so low.
rep,so that's the kind of detail you get now today like i mentioned before in omniture you might actually get some misleading information with extinct search works but i actually did not buy from search.
rep,what we do is we actually tracked one-to-one correlation if i search for say leggings i see the search results i click on the search results i do not buy that product from search results i search does not get the credit for that conversion so you get a true understanding of what the conversion rate really looks like any questions so far.
rep,okay all right next is synonyms stemming so kit cat litter or kitty litter litter dog deodorizing or dog do or even error corrections if i misspell aquariums let's say for example here's the experience that the customer has they either get no results and they figure did you mean and then you have to click on the did you mean and have then get results and sometimes you are only getting the did you mean is because you have created a synonym on the back end so your search person is constantly creating synonyms for every spelling mistake and she only she or he only does it after the fact when they actually look at the report once a week once a month etc.
rep,with unbxd 85% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box and not because we've created synonyms on the back end it's because we use algorithms to actually solve spelling mistakes stemmed words 95% of stemmed words are sold out of the boxbecause we use natural language processing to figure out whether these two people key words are exactly the same results.
rep,so next thing is facets and filters so this is a important one because you have a little bit of a broad category so let's say i go to dog cat canned food let's say okay.
rep,and here based on the experience i have brand price availability etc right now let's save my search for cat food hopefully will not redirect awesome so now you can see i have pet category brand price availability.
rep,and here's the problem for category pages you have optimized what filters customers actually choose and you've put them in that order but with search results it's not possible because i can search for that same category of products a thousand different ways .
rep,i can search for cat food or i can or it's actually showing me dog food right now but how maybe this cat and dog food never mind so but i could easily search for say cat food with grain or beef cat food or something like that so i can search for cat food a thousand different ways you want to make sure that brand shows up first then category then price then availability right .
rep,and it's not possible to manually do that in search because you cannot just manually go and do that for every single queries just physically not possible.
rep,what unbxd is done is we've solved this well the way we've solved it is if you have set it up something for category pages search will automatically pick it up and show the order of the filters for that category is no matter how i search for it.
rep,and second we also use dynamic data so we use click stream data and machine learning to figure out and say maybe for cat food customers are searching for prices a lot then price is automatically going to come up top you can now override this are you merchandising you'll have access to our merchandising dashboard i'll show you what that looks like.
rep,let's see i think this is apparel catalogues i'm just gonna pick something little quick let's say okay women's dresses it's perfect .
rep,so let's say women's dresses is a category i can go into dresses click on the facets on the left and now what you'll see is the standard order or the default order of facets as determined by the algorithm so the algorithm will come in and say okay price is first and colour title etc now you may come in and say you know what that's not how i want i want colour to be first i want say gender to be second this is just sample filter so please go buy it but i just want to show you how easy it is on occasion to be third and that's it hit save and no matter how i search for dresses this order of filters if i search for black dress red dress evening dress a black evening dress party wear party dress doesn't matter the filters will always come to this order.
rep,and you can define this for every single one of the categories if you wanted to or you can let the system figure that out for you as well based on what customers are clicking on.
rep,and you can do the same thing by the way and add for banners also if let's say you had 10% off all cat-food didn't matter how which can't for anything and you wanted to show that banner you can again come in and set it up a banner in url or in html banner and no matter how the customer search for cat food the banner will automatically showed up.
rep,so this way you can see the trend here and what we are trying to do is we are solving a lot of the problems that you're probably solving them manually today which is not necessarily scalable right.
rep,and so we're solving those problems so you don't have to manually solve them but now you also get tools and access to technology that allows you to scale the business i'll give you another example here let's talk about queries okay.
rep,let me just show you the video because that will really help making it easy for you cuz like internet is a limit slam traveling i'm using the hotel internet .
prospect,no worry.
rep,so so annette today you probably have seen that customers vide differently based on geography maybe based on device may be based on channels so you spend a lot of money on your marketing team spends a lot of money to bring traffic to the website right the top of the funnels you send emails you do facebook ads social media ppc kind of her a lot of stuff .
rep,but when they all come to the middle of the funnel which is your website the experience is exactly the same no matter where they come from so we have now come up with a personification engines that actually figures out based on like we showed you in big baskets based on your past purchases we'll try to personalise the experience that you have on the site but in a lot of cases you will also have customers who are brand new .
rep,and you know that new customers coming from a specific segment will behave differently so how do you optimise your website whether it be category pages or it be search by the way doesn't matter whether it's search or category you can optimize using segmentation.
rep,so here let's take an example looking at candle shirts as a subcategory and i want to create a segment for that so what we'll do is we'll create a new segment and you run campaigns so your campaign has a start date time and end date time and then you can define an audience which audience is going to see this now so you can define the audience by new or repeat visitors you can define them by device so desktop tablet or mobile and then on the right-hand side will also show you a forecast of how many customers you're actually going to impact this is something we're still working on making sure it's honed in perfectly but this piece is available today .
rep,then you can pick geography and then you can also pick channels now let's say you have completing merchandising ideas maybe you have partnered with one of the brands and you want to showcase those brands up top .
rep,but you don't want to showcase that brands everybody you can now split the traffic you can create multiple merchandising segments for that same category page so the product assortment for that same category page it's completely different for each segment and you can split the traffic say 30% merchandising idea a 30% idea be 40% base algorithm the unbxd algorithm for example and then you also get the ability to merchandise now what tools you have in merchandising is you can boost so you can boost based on any attribute that you pass us in the catalogue you have your price you care about categories your margins inventory etc you can also slot slot is a a advanced pinning technique where you take specific product locks so let's say a cat food and you decide and say you know .
rep,i have 50 products in cat food i only want to merchandise the first two rows so i want to merchandise first six products the first two products i want to show the best selling products or maybe my private brands private label brand the next two i want to show you some new arrivals and the next two i want to clear the inventory for some other product that i have you can then slot specific product blocks with specific rules and so here let's say from 3 to 6 i'm gonna pick a price of greater than $25 so you can see here from 3 to 6 i'll see all products that are greater than 25 and you can also sort you can also pin pinning is i'm sure you have used pinning in the past where you look at a specific product and you want that product in a specific product logs you can add banners to this you can add facets to this you can hide facets if you want to etc also.
rep,and this is how you can create a complete product of sort things its messaging for that same category page but different product assortment for different groups of customers all of that is doable right here through our merchandising dashboard.
rep,so that's the that's the product and then any question that i've been giving you uh i've been pouring you through a firehose so tell me if you have questions question concerns suggestions like it don't like do.
prospect,so no i think it's good you know some great technology and definitely be seems to be very intuitive with less manual work which is great.
rep,aha.
prospect,what is the implementation like on the site if we did choose to go with your technology.
rep,got it give me a little bit of idea and then what platform are you guys on today.
rep,demandware.
rep,demandware got it so with demandware we take the ajax approach which roughly and i can send you this implementation document also there's three things that we need what is the product catalog and if you're assuming you're already sending the product catalog to let's say my values etc .
rep,second is the analytics integration this is very similar to your google analytics or omniture integration you put javascript tags and that's it and then your search integration so search integration has two parts one is the the autocomplete so we give us a front-end script for audit completes and another script for the search results the whole endeavor takes about four six weeks from start to finish hopefully i answer your questions there .
prospect,yes and then how about product cost .
rep,got it so cost is based on the sessions so we have three products right so these although you show you the site search product you also have the the video that i showed you was your category product and then for your category pages so if i wanted to go through our navigation screenshot by cat cane food that's the sort of end if you want to maintain and merchandise that's a different product and product recommendation so if i actually go in into the pvp and i'm sure you use using my bodies they do a lot of probation also so keep shopping all of this you have that it's a site search and category pages is based on your site sessions the number of sessions that you have and your catalog as long as your catalog is under a hundred thousand products it doesn't necessarily make material difference right sessions then becomes the true variable so if you give me some idea on what number of sessions you have roughly i can give you a rough idea on what our pricing is and by the way while you're thinking about that and then i want to show you one last thing.
prospect,so we let's say roughly 2 million visits last week .
rep,of per week so about 8 million per month got it and were you were you thinking for all category and sur site search are just site search.
prospect,say that again i'm sorry.
rep,you are you thinking just site search as a solution or site search and category pages.
prospect,probably so well i don't know tell you the truth.
rep,let's say site search so give me some idea what is your site search volume roughly out of the 8 million or two million last week what would site search be 25 percent 50 percent .
prospect,let me say 50 percent.
rep,so here i'll show you something that if you can see my screen let's say your site search visits is 4 million a month roughly let's see your site search conversion rate is about 3 percent just on picking number okay and let's say your average order value is 50 bucks again picking a number.
rep,so roughly you're making 6 million dollars from site search per month i don't know if i'm close enough for way off but i just want to give you a an idea in terms of sense of what this might look like.
rep,anonymizedso let's say if we come in and increase five percent of your conversion just five percent that means we will add roughly about three hundred thousand dollars in incremental revenue and let's say if that cost is about ten thousand dollars then we are roughly making 30x the money you're investing in us.
prospect,okay so you like me .
prospect,so how much does it i am just looking at like so how much is the cost we would have to pay 10000.
prospect,per month .
rep,correct for the month yes this is for the month yep.
rep,then we also make sure that you actually see 30x roi on top of the investment that you are making and you have a poc model and that where you try is for 60 days or 90 days if you do not guaranteed give you an up taking conversion you walk away don't pay us anything.
rep,and we do this with every single every single one of them with hsn with bed bath & beyond no matter what customer you talk about we give everybody up you see an opportunity to do a poc unless you know they really love and they just want to start with using us then we do a poc 60 days or 90 days try it if you don't like it walk away no questions asked.
rep,by the way it's six million dollars the right number and it i just want to make sure we got the right number in front of you so you can see because it might be a bigger number and we actually showing there are our wives so here if you look at column b i've put in here 4 million side search visits it's your conversion roughly 3% or is it 5% can you give me some idea and estimate it doesn't have to be exact.
prospect,4 percent probably good.
rep,4 percent and average order value.
prospect,45 ok so there we go roughly 7.
rep,2 million per month from site search would that be a fair number.
prospect,sounds good that match quite sure to tell you the truth.
rep,i couldn't send you this spreadsheet an ad so you can play with this as well essentially you just change three numbers and i'll highlight them in yellow so you can see what three numbers you can change that you can see so these are the three numbers i've changed that are highlighted in yellow now what column c does is we're basically saying if i increase your conversion everything else stays the same right your site visit stays the same your average order value stays the same only improvement we do is in your conversion rate .
rep,by five percent let's say that means in row 9 you can see you're adding about three hundred and sixty thousand dollars per month in additional revenue and i'll call sis let's say ten thousand dollars .
rep,and annually we are making you four point three million dollars versus our cost is around twenty thousand dollars .
rep,so that's roughly thirty six times the roi now if i was ten percent let's say we have a small bump in and twelve percent we do 20000 and then that's it we don't change the number after let's say we go to a 20 percent as 10 percent pop up and said any given point in time if we do 20 percent improvement and at twenty thousand dollars you pay to unbxd we are giving you 71 times the roi.
rep,and if you don't see an uptick walkaway.
rep,you obviously wont see 20 percent in in first 90 days you'll see sorry closer to five to ten percent .
rep,now in some instances depending on how much investment you've already made into site search and add you could see 20 percent by the way i'm not saying we just want guarantee 20 percent and but in .
rep,for example express within first three weeks we were able to see twenty eight percent improvement with fresh direct we were able to you know they were telling us before the cmo was telling us that if you increase our aov by 50cents people are gonna pop champagnes upstairs and on the top floor and we increase the average order value by five dollars and this was all within the first 90 days.
prospect,wow.
rep,yep and annette i know you've just moved into this role you want to make an impact into the business and you've seen the stories all around right every single you turn around and you see a retail store that's closing there are tons of projects that you can do to improve what is the project that you can do to make the most impact in the shortest amount of time.
rep,you already are spending money to bring customers to the site you already have a flywheel that fulfills and ships the owners out maybe pick up in store or ships through delivery but it's that middle of the funnel if you've not optimised and spent on middle of the funnel to optimise the spending you're already doing on the entire infrastructure this is the projects that can give you the most impact make a mark for you also in the organisation to say you've come in and this is as we wants to make you look like a hero that's all the opportunity we are asking for.
rep,give us the chance ourselves out if you don't throw out take our behinds and close out of the door.
prospect,okay are you able to send me some of the deck part of the deck i mean like i said .
rep,i can send it.
prospect,my values right now i'm not really sure then look into how long we're under contract with them that piece i don't know .
rep,but my values  i'll tell you two parts absolutely figure out what contract timeframe you have with my values i can tell you that if my values you're doing prior recommendations they're they came out with a product recommendations part i don't know what they're doing for you on search but you can do an a/b test if you have an a/b testing tool test us in the meantime while the contract is up get the confidence that either we are running and actually blowing the numbers or we're all just showing you flames fancy slides and we don't know what we're talking about.
prospect,then you know you can renew with my values right and i'm sorry i'm like it's monday we're not we are doing product recommendations with my values we're not doing search .
rep,okay there we go that's better no no that's okay so then there's an opportunity to help you with site search and also for the category pages by the way we've not talked about that because since you are doing merchandising you know what do you guys used to how do you guys do merchandising today a net for product assortment.
prospect,what do you mean.
rep,so let's say if i went to let's say i went to shop by pets i went to dog food dry food i went to this category page i'm assuming somebody's making sure that these what products show up up top .
rep,that's your key figuring that out right so what do you guys used to use guys where's native tooling .
rep,got it's okay so what we can do is we can enhance things demand where's native tooling to the next level where you can actually do it by segments you can do it by channel let's say you your marketing team is doing a campaign now an email campaign when that email customer comes to the site and let's say you wanted to show say the authority grain-free okay in that email but when they come to the site and see this they're going to see these products up top wouldn't it be great if they come to the site and those customers see the authority on top other group of customers who are coming directly from some other channels see the normal assortment that they would really see.
rep,and that's what a category our category pages tool will allow you to do as well.
prospect,got it say basically so it's almost like a personification of sort.
rep,exactly you got it it's segmentation and targeting after personification its segmentation and targeting yep you got it .
rep,then it gives you the control on how you want to segment and personalise.
prospect,any questions on it you know i don't know i don't think so i do have one well actually i have a question for you so from a predictive search experience how much is too much so i noticed you know you had said it for the bird search we had two so we had four but then your examples was much more robust so how do you know the son too much.
prospect,because i believe you have most searched you had some top products so you know i mean there's seem to be a lot going on.
rep,all right and and i think it all depends on from how you visualise your business to and there this work for a big basket because the kind of customers that they have the kind of usage that they want the customers to have now i'll give you an example there is a customer called ss396 they're roughly a hundred million dollars in annual revenue online but they sell auto parts muscle car auto parts .
rep,when we tried something like this with their customers their customer is much much older in generation typically and they just got overwhelmed with something like this they're like i don't know where to go now.
rep,so we obviously try to simplify what that looks like so you have to obviously know what your customer experience should be and we will help you i just wanted to show you all these different variations to give you an idea of what is possible now let's say if you come in and say you know what i want something like what express has but right now what we are trying to show from expresses i have a dress and i have dress that's available in different styles that the customers are usually using and clicking on and filtering based on that .
rep,so there's a machine learning component this tries to pick out but you can come in and decide and say you know what i see five here but i only wanna show three because if i give too many options to my customers they'll get confused .
rep,maybe you start with three and then you can go to files maybe you start with three and then go to seven etc so right now we are showing six products you can show a eight you could show four so there's different components to it this is where the when i was saying that you know we know search but we don't know your business.
rep,you know your business more than me juice so we will come in with ideas around what's possible and a lot more is possible to us but ultimately combining our technology and your requirements and your needs business needs will come up with with a solution and by the way that a solution is not written in stone if let's say we try something six months down below rain you figure out and say you know what this isn't really working out we need to either simplify or need to add more you change it again.
rep,and i'll show you one last piece since you mentioned it here's the type-ahead report so there's five different components within a type id right you have the in feature in the keyword suggestion top queries popular product etc we give you the analytics to actually track what every single component within the type of hair does and what its direct correlation to conversion is .
rep,so you can see here keyword suggestion or popular products you have to divide this by 100 so popular products has about 14 percent conversion rate compared to say top queries .
rep,now this is an apparel type example which is why it makes friends so look at right i know you see this is going to be obviously popular than something like not here but in your case it will be much different exactly so so we will give you the analytics and it's all a data-driven decision based engine where you look at the data and say you know what this is the decision we want to make pay for that.
prospect,interesting think okay .
rep,so that just quick questions what are the next steps what are you what are your thoughts is there is this something you see as an opportunity should we come out there do a big hole demo top to bottom detail give you an idea on what is possible what we can do etc.
prospect,i mean i think yes i think yes.
rep,okay okay .
prospect,on site search being one of those keys that needs to be updated one of the work streams we're currently working on right now .
prospect,so for me it's more of timing at this point just you know we have some deliverables in the next month and a half that we're working on and then i don't know if we'll be able to do much before then because the team's all the teams are working on you know from just updating our homepage all the way through product detail product listing cart everything so like i said a lot going on that needs to be delivered by the end of may.
rep,so get all of those conversations out and if you guys are ready by the end of may we can allocate the resources on our end if everything looks copacetic we can go ahead and execute.
prospect,okay and i was noticing and it will be helpful to - if you can give me kind of a breakdown because i mean we covered a lot of stuff so i mean you do from the on-site search the type-ahead you also do what we call i mean dynamic refinements based on term the category pages so if you can kind of bull a point all of the different functionalities that you have i think that would be helpful to me as well.
rep,absolutely i'll make it very simple i'll send you the deck that we prepared but i'll show you one slide so that it gives makes it very clear to you right now you see the six thing here.
rep,all of these things that i showed you i included into site search and it's all part of one package including the merchandising on the back end by the way the merchandising that i'll show you that is all included into site search.
rep,the merchandising component for the category pages that's just in addition in terms of because the volume of sessions that will now be serving that changes so that's just a slight change in price but it's essentially the same technology that you can extend to the category pages.
rep,but everything that i showed you is included starting from the relevancy the type-ahead the error correction the filters dynamic filters and they kind of mobile optimisation merchandising on the back end all of that is included in the one price point .
rep,and i'll send you this presentation also so you have it.
prospect,okay that would be great.
rep,ya absolutely.
prospect,and we may schedule another call in between but i think you know this is helpful and definitely have a more omnture platform than some of the other vendors we've been talking to.
rep,well thank you we really appreciate you saying that so only two things in it what do i'll do is i'll definitely send you this i'll also send you the implementation document so you can share that with your team if you want it the only thing we request is and if we can sign we can sign an nda if you want us to do that if we can lock down some of the numbers that you shared and i can give you an roi sheet also so you have that as well so i can finalise the pricing as well so you can see exactly what you're gonna get wedding and and you'll have everything you can then and we will follow up with you say sometime next week would that be a good time or later this week whatever is easy for you.
rep,perfect and we will follow it next week we'll go through one more round to walk you through exactly what this demo would look like before we set up a big team meeting so that you don't feel like you're gonna embarrass you.
rep,so you're exactly going into that meeting what is it that you're gonna present and and then based on what availability you have in your teams availability come out and present.
rep,sounds like great plan.
prospect,sounds great yes sounds perfect .
rep,so expect an even funnier me or justin he is on the call as well so i'll send you these three things and we'll try to bother you again sometime next week.
prospect,okay that sounds great.
rep,awesome any questions not answered for you that i can answer for you today .
prospect,okay no other actually no i mean i just the breakdown was helpful .
prospect,that spreadsheet you just share me
prospect,really with my biggest question.
rep,oh got it no problem the only other thing i was going to ask annette is if you have any availability in your calendar for next week we can just put a placeholder 30-minute or one hour call next week can you share something and you can always change it if things happens there in terms of priority.
prospect,about friday have like 11 o'clock i don't know what time zone you're in but.
rep,i'm in central .
rep,what time are you one .
prospect,so it's technically specific so it's four o'clock here assume it's the time there's like three or two .
rep,so you're saying friday 21st at 4 pm pacific .
prospect,no 11 am.
rep,11 am.
prospect,which would be 2 o'clock your time what .
rep,1 o'clock my time yep that works .
prospect,ok .
prospect,ok i may have my conversion specialist it in and maybe we can you know go through some of it a little work that .
rep,absolutely not a problem at all sounds good awesome but thank you so much and we really really appreciate your time thanks for all the questions and thanks for sharing and expect an email from us shortly and if you don't hear from him before will again talk to you on friday the 21st .
prospect,okay all right sounds great thanks.
rep,thanks annete.
rep,okay okay andrew do we need to wait for anybody else or is this gonna be you and i have a call.
prospect,yeah just just you and i.
rep,got it perfect andrew first of all thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to speak with you and we really appreciate your time i think andrew you signed up for a customer experience report is that correct.
prospect,yeah when i was at east hill they showed me some sort of report that they generated.
rep,got it okay so you have seen that report from some us in terms of what we had worked on and i just wanted to get the context andrew i personally unfortunately did not meet you and give me a little bit of context did you like the report was there any feedback to the report are you looking to actually now solve some of the things that we were able to identify we do some some help and understanding with background check .
prospect,well let me have a look here i didn't receive the report until yesterday so let me have a look at it .
rep,i can walk you through the report not a problem at all we can go through go over it again and if that's what i want .
prospect,yeah we want that i don't have a lot of time here but.
prospect,i just want to go through the main points.
rep,absolutely so the idea behind the report then if you can see my screen i don't know if you can or not but be what we do and this is our expertise and obviously it is only to our expertise that you can see some of the things and how we can help you we saw that on shop dot watch com from a product discovery and experience perspective let's just we start with site search you have a good search box and i know you you are a brand you don't have thousands of products but you have a good number of products and sometimes customers are coming in and searching for certain things and these are based on a category or based on a certain type that you're looking for in terms of watches by the way my first gift for my wife was a swatch watch that's my personal relationship with swatch watch and i still have it and
rep,i should have it right if i loose that i will be in trouble but you know the idea behind that is i search for let's say if you go to page six i'm searching for digital watches i'm actually not seeing digital watches if i search for let's say men's watches right i'm not seeing men's watches n and i can i can show you on your if you can see my screen i'll say you know men's watches and while you have those in your taxonomy in your navigation there will be some customers but small percentage but some customers will always want to use search and you know sometimes with brands like yours the search traffic is maybe only 10 to 20 percent however the conversion rate of those search customers and the percentage of revenue that they bring to the table is sometimes 30 to 40 percent so while they are small in numbers search customers tend to spend a lot more and convert a lot higher because they have really high intense right.
rep,and and that is the challenge that we believe that we can help you with and there's a lot of techniques that we have both from a from a brand perspective because they solve the queries but i also want the ability to merchandise and create those pages for my marketing campaign and we have can see my screen andrew by the way i just want to make sure.
rep,can you see my screen.
prospect,i go yeah your volume is a little low though a little trouble hearing you.
rep,oh see if i can come closer to the phone here okay is this better now.
prospect,a little bit.
rep,okay all right so if you can see my screen i'm gonna show you a quick video of what we believe is going to be something that you from a marketing perspective to really like today andrew you guys spend a lot of money to bring customers to your site but you send out emails you do ppc campaigns you do you new social media posts you do seo optimisation a lot of stuff and that's your top of the funnel but when the customers come to the site your middle of the funnel has the same exact experience like everybody else regardless over the came frame came from now your loyal customers who might have bought something from you in the past are still seeing the same things that imprint and visitor might be seeing on your site right and that is what are the big challenges that brands face today because they are not able to segment the experience based on where the customer is coming from based on who the customer is.
rep,so what you're seeing in the video here is our a product where let's say i'm looking at casual shirts this is just a apparel example but for casual shirts i want to run a campaign on the site will start daytime end daytime and i want to then figure out what to show to a particular segment of customers now how do you segment them you might be from our experience working with almost 1200 websites we've seen that the big segment is first-time visitors and repeat visitors right your first-time visitors or new visitors typically have a tendency to buy something that's not so expensive or something that very popular and you want to make sure that those types of products are one that a first-time visitor actually see but repeat visitors are less price sensitive they are willing to pay more because they've done their research and now they've come back for the value and they're willing to pay a little bit more for the last
rep,second is we've seen difference in experiences between devices so desktop versus tablet versus mobile customers behave very differently same thing with location different customers from different locations by differently and customers from different channels like an email direct channels organic etc and there be some custom segments that you might also have some customer some ability for you to define and talk to here loyal customers right and.
rep,that's the experience that you have the ability to build you can define the group that you want and for that same category page or search page you can define a very different experience on what products you'll see sometimes you might want to get rid of inventory and sometimes you might have completing merchandising ideas you're also been able to a/b test it will just split the traffic and say okay i have these new arrivals during the july 4th event or the memorial day event that's coming up.
rep,you want your new launch of products to be shown to certain customers but when some other customers come in you might want to mix it up and say i want to show my best selling products but also some new products and also show some inventory clearance that i want to get rid of.
rep,this is this sounding like something you are interested in andrew something that you have been looking at or something you try to solve and to all things out there.
prospect,just in your step back i mean we yeah we're we've been aware of to starting with the search but there's definitely a lot of work that can be an optimisation that can be done with a search.
prospect,is right now the way it's structured is we have you know basically i just myself and my colleague work on the us ecommerce site for swatch watch and then we have 10 to 20 different ecommerce markets around the world and then the headquarters global headquarters is in switzerland so we are in miami and the us headquarters for swatch.
prospect,but every team basically works you know with their local respective markets however we have to kind of to some extent mirror the you know the global kind of guidelines as far as you know as far as the site goes and as far as the way the site is structured so yeah we've been aware of definitely some limitations the site is a little more structured for kind of navigation and discovery than it is for search right now and yeah there's there's quite a bit of things we want to do i mean this could be an example of one that would be nice too differently try but the situation we're in right now is that there's a whole chain of you know discussions and kind of approvals it has to go through in.
prospect,so we're not i mean it's definitely something that we're looking to improve but i can't give you a you know we hope that it will be this year because i'm just personally speaking i think that you know there's obviously a lot of optimisation that needs to be done to our site particularly with the mobile experience not very happy.
prospect,at all with our mobile conversion rate we actually updated our our site we migrated to a new instance you know of magento back in july and supposedly that was going to help with our mobile conversion rate but i was looking at it the other day and it's pretty much stayed stagnant before in.
prospect,our migration and obviously mobile is the direction everything's headed so that's kind of concerning i mean desktop obviously is very important to us you know when i kind of what i personally what i do personally as i manage our you know us email marketing program and then i work quite a bit with the site merchandise which i guess you guys would four under but um it gets a little heavy when we have you know new platforms or new features we'd like to implement because we're we only have certain access rights within magento at the local market level that makes sense and then if we want to go deeper then it kind of has to go through this whole process of review by you know it possibly legal possibly finance and then global hq e-comm so but with that said kind of what we typically do and what we're starting to do we're in this the reason i met with you guys at e-tailors where you know myself and our us head federico are definitely aware of a need to optimise to put it lightly our you know merchandising in our search and site navigation that we currently offer.
prospect,in my opinion our conversion rate should be a fair amount higher particularly with mobile.
prospect,so we're starting to kind of you know see what's out there for solutions you know and i've talked to a few now including yourselves but we're kind of at the introductory replay it's just the exploration phase .
rep,got it and that's perfect andrew because from our perspective i want to give you two parts to that answer one i totally understand in terms of how global brands make decisions to integrate something and they have to write because you're a brand you're not a retailer so there's a certain image to upheld a certain type of you can become too salesy even though you want the conversion to go up can't become salesy in terms of your approach so you have to talk to the customers that way it has to look a certain way so i completely get that and we work with a lot of brands we work with express dot comm which is a huge branch of rule 21 another big brand we work with ashley furniture they they are their own brand of furniture and so we from a brand perspective that's our speciality because we work with brands we work with so many brands that we've understood that the there has to be that balance between functional and still being the brand image and maintaining that brand image.
rep,so i'll show you some examples and i know you know that you know this is an area of improvement that you got to do i'll give you an idea of what we are able to bring to the table and why it will be easy for you to sorry about that it will be easy for you to work with us compared to any other of the vendors that you work with or you've talked to.
rep,so starting from the top level is we don't necessarily give you a template to implement we customise our solutions for every single customer that we work with because we understand that your business is going to be different from what expresses does what wayto21 does so what ashley furniture does.
rep,and the idea behind that is that is the reflection of the brand that it doesn't need to have right so so here you see for example if i let they search for jeans just see autocomplete.
rep,sorry my internet i'm working out of a hotel that if you're travelling so our internet is a little bit slow so if my screen is a bit delayed i apologise.
rep,but the idea behind this is if you think about the experience with up here'll and even in some instances from fashion where where your vertical is a passion in apparel vertical you want to start engaging the customer with that first interaction right which is why you have those big banners of the homepage big images etc so that's the same thing you you want to do on search as well as soon as i start to type in some keywords you want to start seeing products product images and start to engage .
rep,the second is you want to give your customers a lot of choices in terms of okay if i'm hovering over each of these some categories you're actually starting to show some better products and different products based on that.
rep,right and this is how i want to engage the customer there's a lot of technology that goes into it it's not about ui or ux.
rep,for example here i search for jeans you see for men for women if i search for an outdated dress you'll see that it only shows four women right there's no dresses for men per set no perfect but but that's the idea the point is to make sure swatch is also a unique way of how customers buy from you how they interact how many products they look at before they decide to purchase one and to convert it so it's extremely important to make sure we define that so we work with you to figure that out that's number one.
rep,number two is in terms of integration with potential so we have a very unique approach and with express any platform that you want express it on atg route 21 is on a atg of customers who are on hybrid ashley furniture who's on site core now going into demandware a lot of different platforms we have a unique approach where very minimal id requirement in order to integrator so.
rep,there's three things you need one is you have to push the catalogues well that's pretty straightforward give us a jump on an sftp or we have a plugin for magento we can pull it etc second is deployer analytics that's also very straightforward it's somebody's one hours of work to actually do that it's like a google analytics tag is put into the adder and done third is the actual search results page right and you put two scripts one for the auto complete because it will go on every page and second for the search results of let's say if i'm searching for dress search for dress you can see that the header is rendered by you everything from the search results is rendered by us and then he renders a footer this way your it team all they have to do is give us a page render the header render the footer and give us a div tag in the middle and put our script and we'll render the entire result so everything you can see from 288 results for dress including the pagination all the way down is completely rendered by unbxd and it is extremely fast we render within 300 milliseconds which is something is an industry standard and that's part of our sla so that's why it's easy to you customise a solution for you specifically nobody else does we make the approach extremely simple so that you don't have to get a lot of ip approvals lot of ip hours in somebody's work of day were four times actually integrator.
rep,you obviously want to test it when we when we work with you .
rep,the third differentiator we bring in is the relevancy engine so not only have we built in a contextual relevance so i'll show you on swatch dot com i searched for men's watch right now you have watches for men like jeans and new genesis etc or you might have gender for men and obviously the watches a lot so that's where it is but when i search for it it doesn't come in the idea behind that is because the base magento algorithm or other vendors out there primarily do text pattern match because the letter m e n overlap that's the reason why this product is actually showing up  right.
prospect,aah.
rep,so that's the that's the third differentiator it's not just we try to do contextual relevance we actually do semantic relevance and we also use machine learning to start to make sure that the best performing products for that particular query automatically start to show up top.
rep,so let's say for men's watches i realise that a lot of customers were clicking on this sixth watch or maybe the ninth watch will take that product and start to percolate up to the top.
rep,right and then the fourth differentiator that very few companies have is the merchandising and that is what i was showing you this video is essentially for the <> and i just wanted to show you the dashboard know that we have a dashboard but because of the slow internet i wanted you to see how you are able to customise different segments of customers both for your category pages so if let's say today i went to swatch dot com and i wanted to say browse by men okay for men and this is what i see as the products that you've listed here.
rep,now what if i am a loyal customer right and these are one of your popular products something most of your loyal customers who already already have this product they would have already bought this one.
rep,so how do you make sure to show something different to only that group of customers i'll give you a use case is andrew.
rep,express for example they're starting to use our category changes product as well the merchant came and said look i have a new polka dot dress i want to send it to my loyal customers because i want them to know about this first get first dibs on it so when i send them an email making the polka dot dress being the hero they click on it i they come to the dressage category i want them to see that polka dot dress up top .
rep,so i'll boost the polka dot dresses for the dresses category page up top but if a customer who is not my loyal customer they also come to the site not through the email but through any channel they'll also see those polka dot dresses up top.
rep,now sometimes it's okay but sometimes i don't want them to see those polka dot dresses i want them to see the most popular dresses that are currently running because i know they are a first time user and popular dresses is what's going to sell better for first time users.
rep,so now you're able to contain and control <> that experience for your customers and you have your top of the funnel funding.
rep,let's say that's it today i'm just making these numbers up andrew you are making a million dollars today per month let's say through you online e-commerce and you're spending about $100000 in marketing activities.
rep,if you were to now take ten thousand dollars off of that let's say for example if you want to take ten thousand dollars off of that and only spend ninety thousand in your marketing activities in ten thousand your middle of the flow you improve your site search improve your category pages experience etc anything revenue now goes from a million to one point two million or one even one point one million right you've taken the ten thousand dollars and garden a 10x roi .
rep,and that's how i want you to think about it to say this makes sense but how do we structure this where you're already spending so much money for top of the funnel but when they come to the middle of the funnel we're not optimising it for them so where do we get the funding from and it doesn't have to be ten thousand i'm just making those numbers up maybe it's only five thousand for you guys and but the roi should at least be 10 20 x in terms of you invest a dollar you should get 10 to 20 dollars back from that investment .
rep,and that is what we will come in and do for you that is the fourth big differentiator we come in and we guarantee an uptick in conversion guaranteed if you do not see an uptick in conversion don't pay us walk away no question asked just give us.
prospect,so what is that looks like you guys offers for some sort of a pilot sort of program or<>
rep,absolutely give us yeah exactly so you integrate us let's show the us site you know 60 to 90 days live traffic within the 60 to 90 days you can either a/b tested or before and after tests if you want to do it that way if you don't have an a/b testing tool we will make sure we show you at least a 10x to a 20 x roi of thinness when you're making or not
rep,so let's just show you 20 to 40 thousand dollars in revenue incremental revenue.
prospect,yeah i mean you know from our side at least the your side we're already pretty convinced that if we're implement a solution such as this that we would certainly see an uptick in and conversions sir so it's you know and there's there's other things that we'd love to do you know such as i personally think cross selling is something we should really you know whether it's you know we we barely do any cross selling or up selling right now i mean if we send out a better cart triggers there's a little bit of it done with that but you know at the checkout you know shopping cart page we don't typically have any cross selling we do there also what they said you know the site search is pretty terrible where as you already saw if you're typing in digital watches or wall clocks or whatever it is you know right now it pretty much only works based on the attributes that are set at the product level and to be honest are we have a data what do you call it product management team that's entering that data and frustrating because half the time it's either incomplete or you know not totally correct or whatever it is so that conflicts with you know some of our search capability there also it's a customer mission types something they pretty much got to type its spot on or it's not gonna pull up so right now they have to kind of know the name of it or at least the partial name of you know the actual name of the watch which it is i'm pretty limiting or.
prospect,would you nobody knows the sku number.
prospect,so that's kind of ridiculous and i guess i'd be a little interested you know i was looking through your report again and i saw there was one just one slide it was page 15 about mobile optimisation and usability but i i guess i'd be a little interested in maybe if he could just talk for a few minutes more show me something about what you guys can do with that.
rep,yeah absolutely so let me i'll show you what i mean by that so both from so we talked about expressed in terms of how that autocomplete was like for example i'll show it to you again so this is my jeans this is what it looks like now if i were to now go in and after my little mobile app open it in a new window so you will see how you try to optimise the mobile experience.
prospect,while you're doing that i can give you an example i was just working on our report yesterday are you know i'm finding it more difficult to you know it's a little embarrassing to say it but we're still using bash and blast for the most part for our email campaigns.
rep,that's not my decision but that's the way they've been at doing it from you know kind of global directions so we're we're actually moving over to a new esp probably 60 to 90 days from now the contracts already signed and we're we're gonna be getting finally into more personificationz and you know dynamic re targeting and hopefully some of the things that we really need as far as email goes but based on the badge implies have been doing for the last couple of years since i came on board just in the last let's say if we compare the last if we compare quarter 1 of this year to quarter 1 of last year we have a now i'm talking email channel only okay we have a 30% increase in mobile traffic through the email channel.
prospect,however we have a 15 percent decrease in conversions probably the mobile channel when we're talking about email so you know that falls rate line with our trends we're seeing you know that mobile is just kind of taking over and i'm gonna be speaking for myself becoming very concerned that we're falling behind the curve there you know i'm saying .
rep,sure so i  totally understand that.
prospect,you know that's just that's just an insight that kind of you know it'll stretch that a little bit .
rep,no i i totally get it so i'll show you a few things in terms of what we do for mobile so here i wanted to just start with the autocomplete piece so if i now were to let's say do the jean thing you can see that we took away the images we've optimised it only with the text aspect of it let's say if you do dresses <> now and how that search explains you saw that this it again rendered by us express only renders the header and the footer we render everything in the middle you can see how our filters are optimised based on that versus when you had filters here they were all horizontal and this is what the filter experience looks like right versus now if i go to the mobile you can see that it's all optimised for mobile in terms of how the ui would work.
rep,and we still work with you because it still has to use your phones it has to use your colours but know that we can work in such a way that it optimises the experience uniquely for that search piece and then you can see we've tried to optimise the number of products to show but we still show enough product and we have some other techniques i'll show you that expresses can go for but some of our other customers have gone for and let's say i moved here and okay so here's my boots is an example i want to see more like these different all your recommendations keep that you are talking about right.
rep,what a lot of customers will have to do is if i really like these boots i have to go in into that page if i don't like it or if i want to see more of them i have to now come back out click on the second one go back in so it takes three clicks just to see two products right just to see the second product.
rep,so instead of that you have this approach where you can see more like this opens up in a modal window you go through all the products you won't like or don't like like it click it don't like it close it go to the next product right here and we have the same approach to do that on mobile i'll show you have to open right now here it is so this is what we've done i'm looking at these sunglasses and on mobile you want to show variety right you don't want to show similarity you want to show a lot of variety you wanna show mix-up different styles when customers want to see similarities but wants to see other types of similar products you can click here more like this open up in a modal window like it click it don't like it close it.
rep,all our recommendations are responsive we have nine different recommendation i'll show you the different cutting test has so we have recommended for you top sellers we have similar products or more like this we have cross selling products i see that you sell jewellery and some sunglasses etc with your watches you can cross sell them you can up-sell and cross-sell cause recommendations real results page recommendations you mentioned about special check right today with spell check you get a lot of viewers so there's two pick two ways how unbxd solves it 85% of spelling mistakes solved out of the box you do not have to manually create any synonym to solve the spelling mistake with unbxd.
rep,in those instances where customers have butchered the spelling too badly and they do see a zero result page people recommendations there as well because we want to give them the option to go back or to go forward the recently view gives them the option to go back recommendations give them the option to go forward.
rep,well we also have by the look or completely to set so if you are merchant in marketing team excuse me if you're merchant in marketing team wants to define a set of products to save this sunglasses goes with this jewellery with this watch you can complete you can create a complete the set so here i'm looking at this short and this jacket this boots and this vest sort of go together and it again it's the modal window you click on this by the look opens up in a modal window if you like it don't like it close it you're back onto the original window .
rep,so from a product discovery standpoint andrew we do front of the store so your category pages search result and your product recommendations we have a product for all three of them and the poc model that you talked about that is exactly how would you would give us 60 to 90 days live traffic you test these results you test everything you know you're not happy for any reason we don't put anything in our contract we make it very very simple if the sun is not shining in miami which is where you can walk away and get out of the contract .
prospect,do you guys have speaking of i think your if you guys are based in india is that right.
rep,no no we are based in mountain view california we have office in california chicago now yours.
prospect,do you have a local support team.
prospect,that's good okay well i just had two more quick questions for now .
rep,and i got a get running soon but one of the one of the other i guess we can say competitor platforms start looking at just you know kind of like yourself we just had kind of an exploratory call one thing that kind of caught our eye was that in terms of inventory we had an issue this past holiday season which was quite unfortunate where you know a lot of the end there was an inventory mix-up a lot of the inventory that just stayed in our us distribution centre got sent out to the brick-and-mortar stores because we have about 40 or so brick more stores in the us so all of a sudden we had very little inventory to pull from here in you know on eecom in the us so when i <> when customers were going to the site busted a lot of the products on whatever collection page they'd go to or whatever would show out of stock and it looked especially bad it was you know the first one the first watches that would show up on the page so they had some we saw some options from this other platform where they could you know we could set rules and things where it would automatically push the out of stock to the bottom or it would you know it's kind of a dynamic thing or even if from what i understand even if we could somehow set it were a full watch was out of stock that maybe it wasn't visible on the page things like that do you guys deal with any sort of inventory optimisation at all.
rep,absolutely so not only from an automation perspective so you can set up a rule to say if there's two types of products right products will go out of inventory that you're never going to restock you don't want to show them let's say for example and there are some problems that go out of inventory that you know are coming going to be restocked pretty soon if there are different kinds of flags like that we can automatically not show out of stock are never going to be stocked products and we can bury or demote the products that are going other out of stock and will be a restock right so the idea is you have tremendous amount of control at a global level and at a category level and at a query level on top of that so that's this inventory so.
rep,now let's say you wanted to have different pricing say for example you wanted to have different pricing for different zip codes i know that you don't today but you want to have less cost pricing might be slightly different than east coast in northwest etc whatever the pricing might be you can have different pricing you can have different inventory for different locations like for ashley furniture they have 250 different pricing based on because their business model is they shift from store right so if that store does not have inventory and you are within that zip code you don't want to necessarily show those products that are not in inventory right.
rep,so we have up to that complexity and availability for you to do that so that's a min for you let's say you also have clearance stuff let's say you have some products that are too high in inventory the opposite problems and you want to get rid of that inventory also we also have a diversity side or a diversity algorithm that figures out to say can i show best selling product which will always be low in inventory with some high inventory products because you might put them on sale maybe other clearance etc so try to make sure that those high inventory products also get the visibility and you've got to reduce them out of inventory.
rep,now you can do that automatically or you can do that using our merchandising dashboard where you can define and say i want to show high mentoring products in the third and fourth position in the 1st and 2nd section i don't need.
prospect,please show me in that real quick .
rep,i've only got a few more minutes but the member <> dashboard so one thing in magento right now that's very cumbersome is we still have to arrange our merchandise our pages basically by either typing in or copy pasting the actual sku numbers so a very time-consuming and obviously you know having a situation where we can either set up rules and/or do drag and drop they quickly reorganise pages you know that's something we kind of would really like .
rep,absolutely put here i'll show you here's a query called dress and i want to edit that sorry my internet is a little bit slow i could show you on this video but i just wanted to show you that we do have a merchandising dashboard they can create a campaign you can put a start and ended on that campaign you can define what devices what segments you want this to actually work on then you can do merchandising so here is merchandising so this is all the products that i see for that particular query i can then define i want to boost a certain from a certain field let's say or or i want to slot or i want to pin pinning is again pretty straightforward where you can define and say okay i found this product i want to pin this in position number three.
rep,right i can just go ahead and pin it and it will start to show up in that position.
rep,this source tool that exists that i want to get rid of this will start to show up it immediately
prospect,okay so and then what i was talking about the this year let me fix this this is the position i want insert this is the preview you see on the right hand side i'm gonna make this third position this products be in third position you'll see that in the third product it refreshes it will show that products in the third position you see that now.
rep,and you can do that same thing with plotting you can drag and drop also you can just drag the product here and put it up across the other side but what's slotting i was trying to show you was you want to make it it's a pinning based on rule so let's say i want fourth position i want a let's say title contains say i wanna pick a flooral so position five there we go he in fourth and fifth position it now shows floral dresses if these two go out of inventory it will automatically show the next floral dresses up top here you can boost.
rep,product based on any category.
prospect,so its in your inventory are they where do they go the out of stock
rep,so they can depending on what the rule is that if you don't want them just show they won't show up if you would want them to show berries towards the bottom those you're very towards the bottom bottom of any page or the results.
prospect,okay and how is this is this basically how is it actually communicating with our inventory control.
rep,so along with the catalogue you give us your inventory feed as frequently as you want every 30 minutes every hour every 10 minutes and we keep updating the inventory on our end.
rep,right so just set up an api or something.
rep,exactly yep we have an api you can call you have an api we can call or we can exchange files on it like an sftp or something like that .
rep,and we can process up to 50000 products every second that's how fast our processing is .
prospect,all right and then okay well so that's i think i'm running out of time here but um what might also be interesting is if you know i know you guys touched on it and one of your slides on your briefly on your report is over but it'd be interesting to see if you could expand on maybe this is having a look and like a little mini on it or analysis of just our focusing just on our mobile experience kind of showing us giving us more ideas about how you could optimise that okay i think you i think you just mentioned the search bar which is obviously one of them but yeah i mean the more kind of ideas you can show us and presents about how you can optimise especially the mobile experience you know and if you want to mention the inventory control or the inventory optimisation as well i think those are admit the two like main hot buttons right now for us because what we have to do is you know have some sort of i have some sort of cases we can build our case i should say so that we can kind of argue this that we need to get this done with with our hq counterparts.
prospect,yeah i mean typically i can just speak more in general how these works first so typically i it's tough for me to comment on time frame because i know right now there it's tough for us to get much done right now it's with hq because they're trying to finish up working on getting the chinese hema ecommerce market up and running which is a pretty pretty big project but .
prospect,after that i think things might open up a little more perhaps for some of these types of projects.
prospect,but to answer your question typically what they like to see is for the local markets to kind of do the research talk to the vendors and basically you know lists are from a local markets perspective lists are you know main kind of objectives and the the main things we we think are important based on because each market has their own trends and their you know their own sales trends their own audience their own customer base obviously that that resonates and the us is quite a bit different than europe even and.
rep,a <> to that.
prospect,so anyhow typically they'd like us to look at about you know or narrow down to about three top contenders i guess you could say in terms of solutions and then present our case to them about you know where each one kind of ranks in terms of our priorities and the ease of integration what the pricing would look like functionality and everything's laid out for them and then at that point as one you know either it kind of get to hand it off or you know you might be invited into the conversation with the swiss team and.
prospect,you know it could be with it could be with eecom well it would probably have to definitely some point be with them but also it could be with i mean the it team basically just test it in legal have to just check that just their main function what they're mainly looking at is that that you guys mainly would adhere to all the privacy laws of any given mark out.
rep,got it there so the privacy can reboot so i just sit in infidel energy sit here in the us.
prospect,who's that.
rep,taking legal.
prospect,well both there is uh as far as you know i mean it it would probably be here in the us looking at it but legal a lot if it seems to me the legal is more so and you i doubt you vendors to who had never talked legal but they just kind of brief you to make sure that there is no you know questionable you know data sharing or privacy issues that sort of thing.
rep,got it i see
rep,so so that gives us a good idea andrew so in in terms of the next step so it it seems like there's a few steps we need to cover before we get to a certain level of understanding as to what the next steps might be so the next steps will work on the mobile piece will work come up with some ideas i can also share our implementation approaches so that you can you can start some of the tech conversations if they look at this there's a very minimal minimally invasive way where we can do this it's called the ajax approach but i also include the other approaches that we use in case you wanna go down a different path and then the third thing is we will send you some questions and you if you can give us some idea on either the number of products you have the number of sessions you i can also give you some idea on the pricing so hopefully that different views of the world of everything that you need and then you can chew on it and then we can maybe in a week or so start bothering you again to see what your feedback is and then you can keep polishing it to how you want to have the conversation is that sounds like a plan getting ahead of ourselves.
prospect,well no that sounds fine but it probably won't be ready to you know it's gonna take more than a week because we have a lot of projects for which are going on right now so if you want to send that over you know in a week or whatever that's fine but it'll probably take me a couple more weeks to get back to you and schedule a follow-up or something.
rep,yeah absolutely no problem i mean you take your time i just was trying to figure out you know shouldn't we be bothering you from that perspective in that time frame and continue the conversation forward so that you're we're moving the ball forward and helping you execute on what you need to need to have right i mean you clearly identified you and your e-commerce head that you want these things we just want to make sure that we get the opportunity to help you with that.
rep,right so i'll work on that i will send it you give us a few days we'll send that to you and and if you have any questions in the meantime obviously let us know if you need to sign an nda to have more conversations let us know on that as well and we'll we'll just send you some questions so that we also get some of the context the better concepts on certain elements and we can start putting things together and keep sending them to you keep the dialogue.
prospect,oh sounds good.
rep,all right fantastic any questions that i didn't get a chance to answer andrew today.
rep,okay all right also so expect two or three emails from us in the next few days and we'll continue the conversation from there.
rep,all right awesome well andrew thank you so much for your time today i really appreciate it and we look forward to continue to working with you.
prospect,okay all right take care.
rep,alright awesome you too thanks bye.
rep,we obviously had a great conversation so thank you for remembering us we appreciate that .
rep,so jenny from your perspective i know that there were a few things on the agenda we wanted to show the merchandising dashboard we wanted to also share the experience study that we had done is there any particular order that you want us to start or you want us to pick and and sort of go to town.
prospect,i think you can just take it away.
rep,okay perfect can you guys see my screen.
prospect,<>.
rep,okay you guys can see my screen i'm hoping now.
prospect,ya waiting to project taken in but yeah we got you here.
rep,okay let me just stop and restart or maybe that works.
rep,you guys see screen now.
rep,yeah okay okay perfect well there we go okay well again thank you so much we really appreciate it just to repeat myself my name is monal patel and i manage to north america business for unbxd to give everybody else i know jenny had some conversation with us but for the rest of you folks to give you guys an idea of who we are we are a product discovery company you're based out of mountain view california six years old we power product discovery for about 1200 ecommerce sites across the globe we have about roughly hundred and twenty plus customers in north america mostly in the us but we have a couple of them in canada. and we've been growing tremendously for the past few years primarily because of four unique differentiators we have solved a lot of problems in front of discovery that were not solved before and we'll show you what those look like today we create a custom solution for each vertical for you guys like fashion apparel vertical you have a very unique solution that is optimised for your vertical and so we don't give you just a temporary solution third is we have a tremendous scale and infrastructure to manage redundancy and any kind of growth that kid donates might have and fourth we're still very affordable we regardless of what kind of features best and everything else we have we work with the business to make sure that this fits into the business model is fits into the pnl model and because of all these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery.
rep,now what do we mean by product discovery there are three ways a customers and discover products on the website on on site category pages site search and personalised product recommendation and we have a unique product for every single one of those customer experiences and clearance towards the ecommerce site.
rep,so here's what our agenda looks like today we'll walk you through the restoration study for cabinets that we had prepared we'll give you some idea on customer case studies and roi and some of what we do and how we work we'll also get into the deep technology conversation as to how first relevance work our personalization work and some of the merchandising components and category page merchandising as well.
rep,so that does that sound fair anything in particular you guys want to cover that i've not mentioned here.
rep,okay perfect so here's just an add-on here some of the customers that we work with today in fashion vertical express 221 we also work with large large mass merchants like bed bath and beyond and we just recently signed up two weeks ago with hsn dot com as well so a lot of expertise in practice in fashion and health pay so here's the three offering that unbxd has we have site search includes our relevant user behaviour machine learning user behaviour the auto suggest or the autocomplete you might call it merchandising and insight then we have category pages your normal taxonomy navigation category pages how do we personalise them how can you merchandise them you can create campaign segments and targeting and then you have product recommendations this is a rigid strategy where different steps in the journey of a customer's experience on the site how we can personalise that experience for them to recommending certain products and we also do that.
rep,so let's get into the specifics of the kitandace experience study okay so what we did we specifically focused on one element which is the site search component of kitten ace and we evaluated the website across five elements starting with relevance then the guided individual auto suggest in terms of what kind experience the customer has when they're using search if a customer makes a mistake the different words they send the words or errors in terms of spelling mistake etc what is that experience of like and then ultimately on mobile what is that usability optimisation looks like for mobile.
rep,let's get into some of the examples okay so when i search for say lingerie on the site you obviously have lingerie inner ware etc but when i search for it it doesn't give us any result if i let's say search for men's pullovers you clearly have meant pullovers it's probably pulling in one man's pullovers the rest of them are women if i do a feature query let's say a white top it doesn't always give us a white top it sometimes being some white top but not all white top and i was looking at it just this morning preparing for this call you have t-shirts so let's see if i go to look at looks a and you have t-shirts and long sleeves but let's see if i search for t-shirts you'll see that i don't see any results now typically you might think and say well search is very small percentage of our traffic which is usually two for fashion maybe 10 20 percent of the traffic is going to be.
rep,hello did i lose anybody.
prospect,nope.
rep,you guys are okay so um typically search might be in fashion and apparel vertical is maybe 10 20 percent of your traffic but if you look at the analytic and i'll show you an example of an analytics that we have so here this is a sofa a small size customer but just wanted to give you an idea you can see here this is a ga screenshot for that customer and you can see here visits without search roughly 208 34000 i'll just zoom in a little bit deeper to read through okay so you can see 234 k of visits without site search and then 34 k visit with site search .good i'll just try to see if i can pull that up one more time there we go all right this will work with so you can see visits without side search 234000 87% with this visit with site search about just 12.9% in terms of the traffic
rep,so if you scroll over and he starts being the revenue you can see that the site visits with site search have almost 46 percent of the revenue coming from search.
rep,aright 53% is coming from non search visitors and you can see the conversion rate almost 4.65 is for navigation or non search customers but 25% from search customers and this is what you've seen is typical customers the new site search are three times more likely to buy from you they have very high intent which is why they're specifically you want to go to a particular product they don't want to wait around clicking and navigating to particular pages this is one of those straight for search and we believe that the same might be true for a kid named sometime the percentage of search users is quite low and the revenues like little but that's also because the user experience for search is not so great customers may have already used search in the past and they know it doesn't work sometimes they would not use search as much and that's why you might see that the usage as well.
rep,and customers search for a lot of different types of products right here research for women tanks tank top you can see what the results look like versus if i navigate so single word queries multi-word feature searches like a white top or a might just be searching for a product type like t-shirts and it doesn't give good results and this we believe is a good opportunity for us to come in and help.
rep,please <> don't take this personally not a dig into what's not working it's the start of our way of saying this is what we see as an opportunity and hopefully you guys see it the same way okay any questions so far.
prospect,no not yet.
rep,okay all right awesome so let's get into the experience aspect of it so when we start talking about site search you can see here with the visual autocomplete as soon as i started searching for men's pants you can see what that experience looks like it very very textual very textual in nature we believe that this should be much more engaging especially in fashion and accessories you want to give your customers the ability to quickly engage with your products and so i'll show you an example so here's an example i express my comic search started to search first a jeans you can see how quickly we started to show jeans and then we also guide the customer so the function of the autocomplete is not just to put some text out there the function of the autocomplete is to engage the customer gives them a sense that they're on the right path so to quickly show them some products that you have that are best sellers best performing products but also guide them so if i'm looking for jeans for women if i'm looking for jeans for men first are looking for very blue jean jeans white jeans etc and experience can be so quick that i actually hover over any of these you can actually see other results would change depending on what i'm clicking on and this solution also needs to be machine learning it has to learn exactly from the catalogue from what the customers are using and try to predict what the customer might be getting into so when we look at jeans there were jeans for rent men and women but now when i'm looking at dress you can see the dress is only for women we're not necessarily coming in and hard-coding those types of elements for both men and women when it does may not exist so that's the visual autocomplete component.
rep,next is i'm looking for synonyms so a lot of times customers might be using some colloquial words to describe their own product and how can you make sure you know you're looking for coat versus jacket how is it possible to make sure that the customers always be good results.
rep,so unbxd has built a synonym library on the backend by scanning almost a hundred thousand e-commerce site indexing almost 200 million product and because of this we are able to do the data enrichment on top of what your catalogue data might exist next is stemming so i searched for a long sleeve versus long sleeve with space without space i might be long sleeve or long sleeve in every single instance you should be able to show the result prolongs these t-shirts or slumping clothes.
rep,today and i believe braden and jenny i think that the platform that you guys are using is hybrids with solar on the back and for search correct.
rep,so in solar today the only way to solve a problem like this is to actually page to solve for something long sleeve without space with space it so create a synonym on the back end there is no other way to do that same thing with error correction if i'm looking for cardigan misspelling a cardigan somehow the only way to solve for that is to create a synonym synonym on back end. with unbxd you do not have to create any kind of synonym on the back end we solved 85% of error mistake out of the box and it's not because you have built its synonym library of all the permutations and combinations of the misspelling it's because we use algorithms to figure out whether the customer has made a spelling mistake in terms of a typo drop the letter transpose letters and we also use recurring neural networks to understand if we suggested a particular correction did the customer interact with it if they did not is there any other possible correction to it that we need to start suggesting and if they interact with that around so that's part of the machine learning components as well is that correct i mean today you guys have spelling mistakes if you see that on the site do you guys have to manually solve that i know that other hybrids solar customers that we work with do that so i just want to make sure i double chicken validate that as well.
prospect,yeah its manual <>.
rep,right and you have to create every single permutation and combination its not just you add one word and it seems worse you have to create that the variables of how a misspelling would have to be that a customer could make and put those in there is synonym.
rep,okay all right the next piece was the experience on mobile now in mobile you do have a search box right up top but again from a relevancy perspective it is still a challenge and again from an autocomplete perspective the challenges of how this would look like.
rep,all right so ignore the scorecard that are internal scoring to see what we should be doing and how should be debating this okay so let's get into the specifics of what our products okay any questions so far i know that i went over this very very quickly maybe because jenny might have shared this document before siding on link around on that specifically.
prospect,no i haven't i haven't shared it out yet um .
rep,oh no okay got it.
rep,on my question would be we have quite a small catalogue and we don't have like a really wide breadth of different categories and types of products we offer so i think the examples you guys pulled out we're great a showing kind of searching for categories we do have is having problems but we're also not the size of maybe express or a lot of other brands you know like there'd be times where we don't have a search or we don't like we don't have even some pretty common pieces um is there so as much of an opportunity for search even with this small catalogue.
rep,i mean even with a small catelogue customers are searching the question is this do you want to spend time manually fixing when a customer who has high intent which is why they're using search is not going to get good results and lose that opportunity or to capture that opportunity and on top of that you can add the user behaviour the personalization component and i'll also spend i just wanted to start with search but i also am going to spend some time on the category pages where you do have a lot of traffic and the product that we have that can give you a tremendous amount of control in terms of how you can merchandise how you can personalize experiences different types of customers.
rep,so we will talk about that as well.
prospect,oaky.
rep,to give you the scope of these and the breadth of our technologies. okay so let me get into specifically we talked about these recipes and shows with the autocomplete these are just back-end technology components into a loop so here's here's an important information flag that i wanted to share a lot of times folks will talk about oh we can optimise solar which is a very manual proposition the question is you would need to try to optimise solar what is it that you actually need to build a really good search solution or you in a category solution or i'll show you what that looks like so with solar or elasticsearch for that matter you get the box in the middle you get extremely fast search that's it you don't get any of the other blue boxes around the middle box so you have this stemming control you have spellcheck control synonym corpus and relevancy the autocomplete all of this stuff has to be built on top of it you don't get your self learning algorithm the user behaviour is machine learning piece the infrastructure behind it to build any of this you can need tremendous amounts of infrastructure and on top of that you're merchandising.
rep,so this is where i'll introduce the category pages component and let me show you we prepared a quick video for you guys to go through this i'll show you there is an actual dashboard so you don't feel like we're just showing your video so here's the dashboard this is what it looks like as well so let me start introducing you through this process i'm working off the hotel internet but it's not one of the best so the figures a video would be a really easy thing to use okay all right.
rep,so when you come to the home page right here on the dashboard whether it's your category pages or your search pages you get a quick executive overview of how your conversion on the site your product discovery on the site is performing how many page views are you getting how many product feeds are you getting add to cart events are happening product serving souls what's your total revenue from category pages which will revenue per category page visit and what's your revenue per page view so this way you can constantly monitor and control and see from a graphical perspective to say where am i today is it getting better is it not getting better it's a part of the trend or not part of the trend.
rep,the next piece you also see in terms of i will demonstrate here let's say you have a category called women tee okay and this is what your products look like when i go to women so this is a demo site was put together for you and i want to influence this particular category page to our tool you can create campaign for that category page and we'll show you what that looks like so i can put in the campaign i can put in the category and we'll do predefined these categories for you so you're gonna have to do this particular set up front but then you can run campaigns around the women's t-shirt well you want to say you know what i want to promote red t-shirts it's the holiday season from this day time to this end date time and you want to now create a marketing campaign around it also so this tool will allow you to generate a url that you can use to create the marketing campaign also so that let's say you are sending an email or a facebook post and you can on that banner here offer banner or the facebook post you can create a link when customers click on that link you will come straight to that page that you're now about to curate okay and then you can start merchandising within the merchandising dashboard within a merchandising component you have the ability to boost products you can boost products based on any attribute that you send us from the catalogue so here we're going to boost it based on colour contains red and on the right hand side you can see the results of the preview of exactly what that change looks like you can pin products you can take specific products and say you know what i want to take this product and pin it into a specific position so you can see here now we took this product which was in the fixed position or i think 9th position and we ended in the second position okay.
rep,the next thing you can do is you can create a banner on top of it now you can create an image banner or a html banner and we were just taking some holiday season banner to show you a demo of that and you can either put a url or on that banner if you wanted the customers to click on that or not but then you hit published once you hit publish this is now available as a campaign and if you go to that url that we created that page which is again within the cheese category page mind you're still within the women teeth category page and only because of that parameter at the end and i think we very quickly went past that so let's say i'll do that okay.
rep,so here you can see i'm still within the woman's t's category page i still see the banner but i see the product sold in in a way that i've optimised using my merchandising and it is for only those customers who come with that url parameter for the rest of the customers who might come in directly from the women tees they will also see the women tees the regular page that you normally have
rep,so this way you can create a very specific product assortment for that same category page but for a specific group of customers only those who have url access to that right
rep,now let's see if you go to another category called women jean and i create a campaign around that so here we are going to again create another campaign and you're going to add another rule and then you're going to create another campaign for that so this way once we get into that category add a new campaign you can have by the way this tells you that you can have multiple campaigns running at the same time with different parameters you can guide customers to different pages for that same category page .
rep,so let's say ok we're doing a foyer campaign start and end date for women jean and now within the merchandising i want to pick out a specific geography so what we're doing here is there's already a segment created for say florida as a geography and you can define the way our geo segmentation works that you can define it down to the city level up to the state level .
rep,and you can select that as a geography start merchandising and now within that merchandising you still have the same controls you can boost but here we are going to instead of boosting we're going to plot some product so slotting is another technique where you can define and say let's say for example i'll take you to our t-shirts pages say a woman will t-shirt with long sleeve and you have this page where you want you have lots of products on this page obviously but what you want is you want to show two bestsellers up top then you want to show next two products there are high in inventory one get rid of those that inventory is two and show those for clearance if they are clearance .
rep,the next two you want to show is new arrival maybe and you you want to merchandise specifically this first six block of products and that is what this tool allows you to do the rest of the products can still run using a personalization algorithm that power to unbxd but you want to override the algorithm using the merchandising control and that's what this is really showing you see we're go to the jeans category.
rep,by the way i know i'm flipping through this i just want to take a quick pause and answer any questions anybody have.
prospect,no .
rep,no okay and we are all from a perspective in some reviews cases does this seem like a valid use case i just want to make sure otherwise i can show you a different example in a particular use case that you guys might have.
rep,no you can use this
rep,okay okay awesome so here we have picked a range of position two and three so this is jean sitting position one you have number two and number three so we want specific set of products to show up in this new position so we're gonna take colour contain green let's say awesome there we go so now you can see after this rule is applied in position two and three you have green jeans available.
rep,now we're gonna go into a section called pinning now we did pin on that red t-shirt or the red top category page the difference between plotting and pinning is that let's say when i plotted these two using the rule colour green let's say this particular product goes out of inventory and you have a mass level that says never show products that are out of inventory this product third product will automatically become the second product and in the third block we'll find another available green jean and show it here if there are normal green genes available this part will automatically this block will automatically get squint and you'll see the fourth product in the third position so the system will automatically work and update based on the rules that you've set and now here i'm taking the fourth block and i'm taking this particular jeans and putting it in the fourth block i'm not putting any banner ads or anything like that and i'm gonna publish.
rep,so now i want to go and refresh this particular page and you can see how this specific order of products that we've defined for women's jeans the first one is as it is the next two are green and the fourth one is that we can.
rep,now we're going to change our location to outside of florida okay and that in pin if i now refresh the page you'll see the original sequence of how the products was showing up because our geo marker will know that you're not from florida in that location you will see the normal of product assortment and not the merchandise one.
rep,now where is this use case become helpful so if you have a region in terms of where you're selling where there is different kind of buying pattern you know that in toronto or vancouver different types of customers come in by differently for the same category page you can define the geo location entity when they come to the women's jeans page from toronto i want to show these types of products first when they're coming from vancouver these are the products i want to show for it now the unbxd personalization algorithm will also take care of that but if you wanted to override it with specific set of products that you want to show you have the ability of the tools who actually override and do that and.
rep,all right i will again change that to not be singapore go back to florida well now go to another category called woman's shirt and any questions so far .
prospect,your client use this commerce to merchandise their entire site or do they usually just layer it under specific high-value pages.
rep,so it sometimes happens to be both so as the base algorithm the personalization algorithm than that unbxd has the machine learning will automatically start powering the product assortment .
rep,so let's say for example most of your customers are coming in or any customer that comes in and comes to this category page this is the sort order that they might be.
rep,now let's say you don't do any merchandising and we start to see that this particular product is starting to perform really well the machine learning component will start to percolate this product up to the top automatically if the customer starts to interact with the site so let's say they are starting to use filters as colour filters they're looking at a fit etc and start interacting with the site specifically for that customer the site will start to personalise the search by results for the category pages and for search.
rep,now the question is if let's say you don't have a lot of customers who interacted but they're coming to your site and only seeing one category page or one product page and then leading for those customers where you don't have a lot of digital trail data available what is it that you might want to enhance that product assortment experience that they have that's where they use merchandising so what are customers do is they'll come in and say i know that t-shirts is my most popular category and i know that i see using the data and we'll show you what kind of data you can get using the data that we have different variances in terms of how customers buy based on device based on geography based on channel customers will come from email versus facebook have different buying pattern i want for my most power popular categories optimise a product assortment for those types of customers .
rep,and for some small categories like let's say some accessories or some other connect category that is not doing so so much in business they just let the base algorithms unbxd algorithm to run those pages they don't necessarily do that.
rep,but there are some customers with small catalogues they sometimes use it for the entire site some customers who have large catalogue focus on large categories and not all categories.
rep,did i hopefully answer your question it is the long winded answer but i hope we answer the question.
rep,okay all right awesome the next was here we were looking at just to go back real quick we were looking at the women's shirts categories now and again create a category link and then we'll create a campaign around it okay and for this new campaign let's say we want to create specifically for the mobile device.
rep,okay so again specifically for that device i want and it runs only for certain time frame start date time and end date time and you have already defined what that segment would look like in terms of the the configuration of what those what the segments would look like so let's talk about the mobile segments and then you go and start merchandising again and here again the merchandising rules you can boot swords plot pin filter etc and then continue on to publish and so here well let's just quickly pin slide a little bit and so now if you go and only go to the mobile device let's say you'll see that you actually have a different product assortment for that same category page.
rep,so if i come from a mobile device now i'm seeing different set of assortment compared to what i'm seeing for a desktop now why is all of this important why should you be doing this so let me walk you through a quick example of the data that we have so what we found looking at across our fashion retailer database collectively we have about 350 retailers who are in the fashion space now when we look at their top-selling products from a particular geography let's start with geography .
rep,so we looked at it and said ok what are the products that are best-selling in california what are what is the percentage of those products that's been sold in florida but only 4 point 62% of those products that were sold in california are actually being sold in florida it's only three point nine four percent in new york .
rep,so you know that there is a big variance in the fashion vertical in terms of where customers are coming from and how they buy right any questions on this particular data point.
prospect,nope <>
rep,yep the next is and you guys will get this type of data from our system so that you can make a data-driven decision and say i do see this variance i do see this is different and which is why we want to make sure and actually segment the customers by geography and i want to show different sets of products the algorithm already does that i have up to a certain level based on some personalization technique but if there are customers coming in with no new customers coming in which is roughly 50 to 60 percent of your traffic you want to make sure that you use merchandising techniques like the ones we showed to override and show very specific products for the segment but this is all data-driven decision making and we show you the data here's another data point device so you can now see here mobile devices the aov is much lower 90 bucks versus desktop is much higher 120 bucks the conversion rate is also almost half on mobile so that tells you that if i were to now show and let's say in your world the data shows up where mobile customers are let's say to we have a result same price point okay there's some high price perfect so let's say customers are both on mobile and coming in and 58 dollars is their average of that .
rep,and on desktop you actually have a hundred and twenty dollars is their average order value so if i come in on mobile and if i see hundred in more than hundred dollars in t-shirts up top how much time do you think customers for mobile are going to spend on your site looking for that cheaper product and it may not necessarily be about being pricing cheap or low it's just that they customers from mobile this tends to be more price sensitive and so they're going to spend a little less so why show them more expensive products high margin products when we know that they're not going to buy right and that's what this data is telling you if if the data tells you that you do have a difference in in terms of how different customers and different devices have different buying patterns show different products to those customers and we did that in that last use case that we showed.
rep,for women shirts coming from mobile i want to show a different product assortment then they're coming from desktop.
rep,the next one is channel so we know that looking at the channel data if i look at social this conversion rate is extremely small 0.32% and the aov that's against extremely small compared to the rest of the site or the rest of the channel.
rep,so if facebook ads and i'm sure you guys do facebook ads correct.
rep,okay you don't think that maybe.
rep,i'm sorry go ahead.
prospect,no we'r good .
rep,okay i just was trying to quit with any of you guys in on ahead because everybody knows facebook ad so let's say you find out in today's data facebook customers or customers coming from those facebook ad have aov 25% less than the normal customer that might be coming from email because their email customers might have had experience with you in the past they might have bought from you in the past they might have given you an email address because they are following your brand and from that perspective they are probably more in tuned and more willing to spend more on the site if they are coming from facebook why show them the same set of products and product assortment where the customers coming from an email right.
rep,and with your loyal customers you might want to talk to them differently you might want to show new products and higher margins products you'll repeat loyal customers but for your first-time visitors you might not want to show that you might want to show products there are not your high in inventory under clearance you will probably give them a chance to experience the brand without a lot of ugly in terms of cash.
rep,so that is the reason in terms of why you should be thinking about segmenting and looking at the targeting those segments through a tool like ours but this is again after the personalization component that is already driving a better user behaviour for that individual customer it's the next customer segment where you don't have enough data to personalise you can start using your merchandising data-driven decision-making to give them a good experience any questions so far .
prospect,my question is so i get all of those rules and everything else oh and why can't why can't some machine learning in ai just make all those decisions for me.
rep,that's a great question braden so let me show you what why is that the case when you look at personalization and we talk about personalization in two different contexts number one is one-to-one personalization so if i want to make sure that i show you the product specifically for you i need some amount of historical data that is statistically relevant some amount of digital trail that you have left behind maybe you're logged in maybe you have bought it from the forest from us bought from us in the past and we have you still have that cookie so we know enough about you to be able to do one-to-one personalization now in the best case scenario there's one-to-one personalization can be applicable to 20% of your customer traffic that comes to the site by the way amazon best of the breed can only do up to 25% of the traffic that comes to their site a one-to-one personalization so we believe it rough estimates a 20% the next 20% where we don't have enough data of people you have some data they have looked at a couple of products they have used some filters and we know some implicit data about them the personalization algorithm will take care of trying to show them better related products based on what we know about them and sometimes there's auto context data let's say i bought jeans of a particular type but for t-shirts you know i might have bought cheaper jeans but i want more expensive t-shirt right so we can't just always use that data from one category context and move it on to the other so this is where we start looking at some implicit data like the like where the customer is coming from there's collaborative data with what did other customers who had very similar behaviour what is they do and start your personalized this is your second 20% of your customers that you can do so total 43 percent of your customer base you can do some level of personalization 20 percent one to one another 20% a little bit on the collaborative filtering aspect so roughly 40% can be addressed as first line
rep,the next 60 percent how do you do that because in most cases there will be first-time visitors or people who might be coming from different devices are not logged in etc we have no idea who they are we have some idea and very implicit signals what channel have they come from and what location they've come from what device they might be using etc .
rep,so there will be some personalization that we can do again but it is not as much because we have no other idea about that this is where the merchants can come in and say we have a specific way we want these customers to experience the product assortment it is in this case where you want to create these rule-based engagements.
rep,otherwise so top-40 l automatically are getting addressed with our personalization engine it's the next segment of customers and how do we help them and address them.
rep,does it answer your question braden.
rep,sort of i think if you're selling us that region matters and that mobile device matters then you should be able to take those other users purely with those intent signals and personalise it and i'm not saying that impact will be so huge but it's a lot easier for the algorithm to say oh look people from mobile who are into your here's our recommendation of what the product should be so now we're like two-factor personalization that it is for us to manually go in and set up oh look new york people really like this jacket in california people don't and then create all these other rules so i get what you're driving we know a lot about them but i'm still like pining for the machine learning to pick up and say these are true intent signals and to be testing and optimising in real time .
rep,got it so let's say and that's absolutely correct so let's say i am from new york using a mobile device and the system figures have to say using machine learning what other customers might have done that this is the sort order in terms of how we should show them let's say that is the case and the system does figure that out but what now happens is if your merchants are looking at this and saying you know what why don't we from a business perspective want to show these are you my best to performing products but i want to also clear my inventory and i were to show next to product that might be inventory clear or my next two products might also be a new arrival and if i wanted to show it that way you have the ability to override the algorithm automatically because it's not about just trying to say if i'm coming from new york and mobile device and i buy these types of products so everybody will buy the same types of product right.
rep,you still want to make sure and apply some business rules on top of it to override and say it is possible for me to make sure i show certain types of products to those customers as well and you want to make sure that.
rep,let's say you send an email you sent an email to some group of customers your loyal customers you want to think that marketing campaign through the discovery campaign to complete the journey because you might have on the facebook post for example you might have promoted your new arrivals you want them to know you want other customers to know that you know these are my new products when they click on that link and they come to the same category page without changing the url you might want to show those new arrivals up top you don't have to create yet another landing page for those customers but the way you want to do this is you only want to influence your first six block of products you don't want to influence you don't have merchandise every single product on that page just my first six blocks and you can do that and now say okay you came from facebook i promoted these two products on facebook when you come to this page i want to make sure you see those two products up top maybe i'll show you some other products that i wanna merchandise and the rest of the products are still or sorted based on the personalisation algorithm.
rep,so that's the reason why to do this it's not just about oh you're coming from this geography etc it's also about synchronising that marketing effort that you're doing at the top of the funnel because see you will talk differently to customers and email you talk differently to customers on facebook so you are spending a lot of time in that top of the funnel so when those customers comes to the middle of the funnel on the site everybody sees exactly the same experience same part of the score tonight even though you know that their buying behaviour is different.
rep,does that hopefully now completely answer the question braden.
rep,okay hopefully so that's the reason why you want this type of control. any other questions this was a good question any other.
prospect,you think we're going to get to a point where i don't have that control like i'm just like take me five years in the future of like the science of where this is going am i i still see it in a space where the algorithm should be able to learn and migrate.
prospect,out yeah and like like i don't know i mean i get that there's a lot of scalable data that's what like do you guys not where you guys be the industry going.
rep,so when you think about some an automation perspective there are there's definitely advancements happening in terms of care and we talked about five years from now we obviously want to get more and more automation in place that is absolutely true.
rep,the question is within that automation what is the business going to be aligned with what's how the algorithm is starting to think of things. let's say for example i have a inventory of certain products that i want to get rid of okay now this the algorithm can see that okay too much inventory of this product but they may not necessarily in terms of where you also have newer i was coming in when should we create that diversity algorithm to mix the new arrivals best sellers and a hive into a product and start showing that up top.
prospect,right away my point is like that's a great example right is where we'll say oh i'm long an inventory crap i'm gonna go like promote this product to the top which is exactly the right short-term thinking and wrong long-term thinking if you're probably here you're either long an inventory because people don't like the product so now you're putting the concept people don't like right up in front of them or you're long an inventory because you had a buy site problem which has nothing to do with the consumer so in that sense i like i want some algorithm and the machine learning to say i understand and i'm long an inventory here but i'm not going to sacrifice conversion rate just to move your inventory because we're actually better of as a business if we're driving consumer acquisition and transnational frequency more so than we are for the cost of that inventory that's sitting there and so loss to deploy other marketing tactics around it and i was that that's the thing is i think i grew with you there's these weird businesses especially in fashion apparel where like we let the tail wag the dog the purity of machine learning should get us to the point where with the light business we'll set up one level higher that it's continually trying to like maintain that and push that through where i feel like i mean i like a lot of the things that you guys are doing but i'm trying to push it one step further and say it's not about pinning that product at the top just because it came from facebook it's about pinning that products with us because that's what that consumer actually wanted to see and then the system knows that you're responding to an ad on facebook that might have had that sweater but everyone who clicked that ad actually buying a different sweater so let's promote that one .
rep,got it so there's two parts to this question barrien i think that where you're coming from is absolutely these are the holy grail of where everybody wants to right nobody wants to do the manual work to figure out and if you could find this holy grail of algorithm that always keeps my conversions up but also somehow make sure that you know optimising my inventory also that would be the best of the brief you would not believe amazon today with best of the engineers that they have spends almost 15 million dollars in just product discovery on their site for technology with people with merchants with everything else that they have available they are still sitting there and merchandising their product and here's the reason why the biggest reason for this is there is no ability to sort of predict to that degree what an individual customer is going to like even when you have historical derive i mean as you showed you the slide where i know that about these jeans i know this is the price range they're looking to buy in but how would we know that that particular customer is not going to spend a lot more money on shoes.
rep,right there might be other customers who have shown that pattern so you can define and say oh maybe the algorithm should figure out and mix in both of those maybe chose cheaper shoes and expensive shoes together.
rep,but sometimes showing it's more expensive shoes right next to cheaper shoes actually degrading the quality and the value proposition of those expensive shoes.
rep,and customers just by seeing those two shoes together might end up not buying any of the shoes because they do still <> shoes together. so the the to try to at the idea behind this is you obviously want to make sure that the algorithms get stronger and stronger what our philosophy is and to give you our sort of approach where we are coming from a technology perspective is.
rep,we make the personalization algorithms better and better like for example two years ago we only used to use track click click stream data so what are the customers viewing clicking adding to cart orders etc within the past two years we've also started to add reviews if you have reviews what we realised is when customers start to spend time on reading reviews that's a very strong signal to buy and a very strong intent to buy so we've now taking that into consideration.
rep,then we started to look at where that's where started to copy paste now in your case you're a brand so it may not be the case but they start copy pasting unless you guys sell your products elsewhere also besides your site the copy paste the titles of the products the utp with skus ids etc because then we know that they are going to shop this product right so what do we now by collecting those additional signals how can we react to that action that the customer has taken in real time .
rep,so that's where personalization is moving that's absolutely true but what we realise is that when we put the extreme personalization components in front of the merchants and say this will all be taken care of by the algorithm the merchants i like i don't trust the algorithms i will never trust the algorithm because how can the algorithm know what my business needs are i'll give you an example and express every month they have some amount of code out of sales that they have to hit right so in that instance what their challenge becomes is that if they're on a 20th of the month and they know that they're running behind their sale quota they're gonna run tremendous amount of campaign for the next ten days and in that in order to do that they might have to do some sales they must on clearance they might also have inventory quota that they have to get rid of how can a algorithm know that a certain business requirement like that come in you can give it to say you always make this sale quota and then start figuring out if you need to start dumping inventory dumping price changes right the louie vuitton when they sell on some website they actually don't want when a customer searches for some dress louie vuitton does not want their dresses to show up unless and until customers search for louie vuitton dresses. see this is this type of control for business requirements business needs we believe the two have to be there we want the algorithm to get better and better.
rep,but the business will always have their own needs and requirements which will which you need to influence the algorithm we don't want you to come in and say oh start pinning every single category page every single product block and stuff like that all we are saying is influence the algorithm by doing certain types of merchandise and when we see that obviously that when you merchandise those first six blocks of products we see that the customers coming from facebook that's the campaign you've done your merchandise is the algorithm also starts to learn that as an input and starts to behave automatically as well so.
rep,sure sure i just want to make sure that i gave you the world of how what our philosophy is coming through from that perspective.
prospect,yeah no i totally get it thank you.
rep,yeah absolutelly you're welcome so i don't any other questions i know we are running over time any questions you guys have anything i can answer any next steps that you want you guys want us to do and follow up with.
prospect,no i think just leave it with us and we'll i guess jennie will reach back out to have a chance to chat about it.
rep,okay perfect .
prospect,thank you guys for that bye
prospect,absolutely thank you so much everyone for your time and the opportunity and thank you for the questions really appreciate it.
rep,alright awesome.
rep,yup bye.
rep,last that we spoke you gave me a good rundown of what you guys are looking for and some of the limitations that you guys are experience today so we are going to cover those so for myself i'd be the point of contact here for you guys and on the phone as well as i have monal who heads our services and our customer success team so he's a very technical from that perspective and he'll be guiding us through and walking us through the presentation hello hello connor do you mind to just doing a quick intros on your end and then we'll get started.
prospect,yeah so i'm connor i run the business side of it and we have william who will give his introduction hello i am from <>.
prospect,hey chandra here wcs architect petco.
rep,awesome thanks guys and so with that we'll get started monal if you don't mind going through the slide i think this is one slide that i want to cover before we get started just to kind of set the tone.
rep,sure go ahead.
rep,oh sorry can you guys see my screen.
rep,alright awesome well thank you again i i could just sent a mail allen just mentioned given us the opportunity here for presenting our solutions so here's a quick rundown of what our agenda looks like today so we'll share maybe 60 seconds tell you a little bit more about us we'll then dive straight into the elements of site search and how we see site search and how we break it down into five different components we'll share a little bit of the analysis that we did on your site just to establish that clarity of what is the opportunity that you really want to talk about and why unbxd and what is our approach okay allen is there a particular piece that you wanted to cover or you want me to continue. yeah i just wanted to cover some of the things that connor and i spoke about and just kind of drive just to make sure that we're on the same page so connor when we last spoke about how things are today in terms of your implementation you have so and how about working for you guys and what you're looking to really solve is around the zero results also being able to have the ability to have analytics that are going to drive the ability to do pivots and understand where the data is coming from in terms of zero result or which queries are working which queries are not working and be able to make changes appropriately also in terms of merchandising being able to have a tool that allows you through a ui to make pinning and slotting and kind of changing things around at your discretion based on you and your partnerships with different brands and right now that's not something that you guys are able to do don't have any recommendations or anything like that really what you're really trying to do at the end of the day is trying to improve that user experience and guide them through the buying cycle so they know which products you guys have as well as exposing them to other products that you might not have and that's through having a better spelling system a stemming system that allows those capabilities to drive that better user experience and that's kind of a high level of what we covered in what i've gathered for the team is there anything that i missed or is that i'm pretty accurate in terms of what we spoke now.
prospect,yeah that's pretty accurate i also think you know we spent a lot of time talking about personalization and understanding what customers are searching and being able to know what we should provide as search results before they even type it.
prospect,so i think for petco does a huge stuffs that we're trying to go in.
rep,yeah okay and i think will show you those kind of capabilities in terms of our offering and that monal will take us through that.
rep,okay thats alright.
rep,alright awesome so let's get into it here we'll start with the with a quick background on about us and i know connor that you've probably had a few interactions last year it's a kind of couple of conferences but for the rest of the team we are a bay area company we have currently have about 400 customers right here in the us 1200 globally and we've grown tremendously in the past couple of years primarily because of four unique differentiators one we've solved a lot of site search problems that were not solved before second we create custom solutions for every vertical so you don't necessarily get the same copy/paste solution that everybody else gets we create a very specific solution for your vertical and how customers interact with your business we have tremendous capabilities to scale scale up and scale out and regardless of all these capabilities our pricing is still very competitive and because of all these reasons we believe that not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery here's some of the customers just to give you a taste of who we work with today all these different verticals fashion hardware electronics etc we work with some of the top ir 250 ir 100> customers like express route 21 ashley furniture one of the biggest furniture stores in the world us auto parts we're about to go live with them as well one of the biggest on-line parts store in the world and we also work with a lot of different platforms including i believe you guys are on wcs but we also work with atg and magento enterprise any questions about us before we get into the other crux of it.
prospect,i think we got it.
rep,okay perfect so before we get into our solution what we wanted to establish was where is the opportunity so we did a little bit of analysis on your site tried to come up with what is it that we feel is the right opportunity and as allen mentioned based on your conversation conor with him what are the some of the challenges that you guys face today and if you start looking at the first interaction a customer has with site search probably with the type-ahead or the autocomplete or autosuggest as you might want to call it right so we were looking at i was looking for some chair covers on the site like your dog chair covers or cat chair covers etc and as soon as i start to type in say chair as you can see in the autocomplete it only categories come up it's missing that guidance that autocompletes must provide to the customers so the function of autocomplete is to guide the customer specifically to where they might want to go so maybe by the categories you are trying to guide them to a category but it does not provide any popular keywords or a quick way to get them somewhere and and you can see these are just two examples but not corner cases and am sure you guys are already aware say for example if i was looking for cat food one of the most biggest categories that you probably have both in store and probably online cat food is nowhere to be as a suggestion so if i was trying to get to one place very quickly the autosuggest has a lot of challenges today second was the relevancy so let's say somehow i figure out the autocomplete and i started typing in say you know fish tank filters and if i started to look for fish tank filters a lot of the suggestions as you can see here in the screenshot are actually fish tanks and maybe if i scroll down below or in a couple of page a couple of pages into the search results i might find those fish tank filters but the problem is and your statistics might slightly vary what we've seen is that 45% of the customers don't bother scrolling down and ninety percent of the customers don't bother going to the second page they are so especially the search customers because they're so used to the whole google and amazon world of experiencing search results very quickly that's what the stats really tell it so it's very important to make sure that the first four of results shows very accurate search results okay another example dog car seat cover little bit complicated multi keyword query and as you can see it's basically showing some travel rack and car seats instead of actually car seat covers non product searches if i search for returns it redirects me to the returns page or but if i search for returns policy it gives me zero results or shipping policy does not bring any results same thing with spellcheck if i search for bedding or collars as you can see here are some of the suggestions in first example the bedding it didn't have any auto correction but in collars it actually tried to figure out a collar with a period and then it provides did you mean colors or maybe collars color colored with a comma etc so there seems to be a lot of text pattern matching that seems to be going in which is very typical of solar to do that let's say if we tried to do multi word spell check like i talked look for a dog kennel and you can see here the keyword suggestions is dog keep but also here are some other ones with dog kennel but it doesn't seem to pick up using machine learning that maybe dog kennel is the right thing that the customer was probably looking for some other examples stemming if i search for say guinea pig on the left it redirects me to a small animal category page but if i search for guinea pigs i actually now start getting results last but not the least maybe second last but not least quickly on the filters so if i let's say i searched for dog kennel as a query you can see that the cat filters on the search results are what i see on the left so i might see category brand or price and then some vegetarian or grain-free now this might be depending on how the query had returned certain relevant to non-relevant results but we know that if i go to the category page the filters on the right are probably more appropriate for that type of search query and we'll show you exactly how unbxd is able to solve this sort of problem at scale okay and the last piece is the performance of search so we ran a quick multi-region test on the search results page and we saw that two different tests that we ran and pretty much the response times are very very long in to multi seconds and as you guys probably know google has published a standard to say that search results should be around 300 milliseconds because anything less than that a human eye cannot detect but anything slower than that and you can start seeing search exit rates to go up so what let's define what the opportunity really it is it's not it's just a query problem right it's not solving one query at a time and petco has thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of queries and you cannot physically fix individual queries so you need a better relevance technology clearly second is you also need a system that understands the business because a lot of times the queries the products might be very overlapping but there's still several differences into whats the products are and so you want a system that actually understands your business and the third is you also need a better site search framework so today you might have your categories that you sell today but you might add new categories in the future and how should those new categories be structured that's where the search site-search framework comes into play and guess what unbxd does all three we provide a technology where we've solved a lot of site search problems that provides a sort of a foundation to scale second is business like we mentioned we don't give you a copy/paste solution that every other retailer gets we try to understand your business and we try to figure out what type of solution what type of user experience is required for your business and third is you also give you a framework we come up with a playbook that both strategically and tactically and collaboratively obviously allows us to solve some challenges that you might encounter in the future any questions gentlemen before i rapped in too many things in front of you guys i just want to take a pause and see if you guys have any questions.
prospect,no not at this point.
rep,okay all right so let's get into technology at a little bit of a high level i want to give you guys an idea as to why is it that unbxd and how is it that unbxd actually looks at this and tries to solve this so unbxd unlike a lot of other systems looks at every individual query and performs these four functions per query so semantic relevance search exclusion user behavior this is our machine learning search and any kind of merchandising that somebody might have applied okay so let's get into every single one of them very quickly and i'll take a very simple example just to demonstrate what challenges you might be facing today and how you might be able to solve it today versus how unbxd approach it and how we like to solve it so let's say we take a simple query women's white jeans today's techniques whether you use solar out or elasticsearch or say deca there are only three outdated techniques that you can use to actually solve something in solar there's actually only two and in deca provide probably one more so there's something called or-ing where i would search for say women's or white or jeans or ending so or-ing is considered like a loose definition of configuration ending is the strict definition of how we want solar to interpret so it might say women's and white and jeans but both have problems because or-ing might end up showing you women's white shoes or jackets maybe not necessary jeans and ending might actually show fewer products than what exists and in deca i don't know if you guys have considered deca or not but there are a lot of other solutions out there which are very similar to this which might give you a third option to say do a minimum match but there's more than two keywords so it might say women's white or white jeans but because it's again introducing this concept of or you again get irrelevant results like women's white jacket or maybe little girls white jeans and what we believe just looking from the outside and on petco our observation was there lot of manually merchandised queries like redirects and such and but then there you guys are probably also using and as a configuration in solar is that a correct assumption or are we wrong there.
prospect,yeah that's correct.
rep,that's correct and maybe that's one of the reasons kind of from a business perspective you guys end up seeing a lot of zero results is because the definition is quite strict so you must have those keywords just start showing results okay so let me explain to you why solar or some other solutions like in deca behaves the way that behaves so when i search for women's white jeans there's a algorithm called tf-idf which is considered a gold standard in search which is used to actually provide the search results so how does tf-idf work just to assume let's say for women's white jeans i get these four results and the numbers in the red are the tf-idf scores for these products now why does a white top have a higher idf score than jeans it's because a tf-idf only gives you either popularity or the rarity score it does not give you any usefulness score which is extremely important in e-commerce so what unbxd has done is we've tried to solve this problem by creating another layer on top of tf-idf called the relevance gain what relevance gain gives us is the usefulness it gives us the contextual relevance that we're at searching for women's white jeans what is more important so here you can see when say women's white jeans as a query gets broken down an idf score might give jeans or women's a little higher score maybe because it's more rare and then white and jeans but we know that in e-commerce jeans is the most important word then women's and then white so this is what unbxd does we create another layer called the relevance gain to recalculate what's the most important keyword so now what happens is because of that we'll be actually able to show white jeans at top but this still creates a problem where the white top still exists in the search results so this is where we do these second piece step 2 which is the search results exclusion where we have scanned almost a hundred thousand e-commerce site created a catalogue of almost two hundred and fifty million products and we've trained our algorithm to actually understand what a product is and what a product attribute is so here we understand that when somebody searching for women's white jeans that jeans is the product white is the color attribute and women's is the gender attribute so now we know that if we have in our search results white tops because it might say you know this white top goes great with jeans or this women's white top goes great with jeans so we get all those keywords but at the end of the day that product is still a top and not a jeans so we'll exclude those tops and essentially we'll remove the white top and push more white jeans on top okay any questions on those first two steps gentlemen so thats what it essentially defines our secrets as to how are we able to solve relevancy problems using contextual relevance rather than just text pattern match no questions.
rep,okay alright awesome no problem step three is now bringing our machine learning what we call is the user behavior search results so what we do is when we deploy our search results we also deploy our analytics and we capture every yes yes go ahead i'm sorry i i don't think i can hear anybody asking a question is there a question.
prospect,yeah are you able to hear us now.
rep,yeah i can hear you now.
prospect,okay so there in the previous screen you had done the exclude word right.
prospect,so that exclude word is a dynamic word or we have to put a entry for that one.
rep,no that is dynamic because what it tries to figure out is my query is women's white jeans so my product is jeans but in the search results i might also get a white top for example because the title of the product might say women's white top goes great with jeans let's say for example or with jeans for example but it's actually a top and not a jeans so that might also show up in the first step of the results collection.
rep,our step two will now look at it interpret each product and say is this a jeans or is this not a jeans.
rep,because it's not a jeans it's a white top it will automatically exclude that top from the results.
prospect,okay absolutely the results are matching whatever the relevancy is the product type is dynamic can we run it manually.
rep,yeah if there is a particular conflict where the system cannot figure out what the product type is and it requires the manual intervention you can absolutely do that yes.
rep,any other questions there was a great question any other questions.
rep,okay alright so step three is now that we've got the search results from top down and bottom up cleaning up that piece we now look at the analytics so because we deploy analytics along with our search solution we track every single click that the customer makes whether they click on the search results click on the product filters sorting pagination etc and we come up with a and this is again tracking per search query okay not a site-wide statistics just gets rolled up this is tracked per query and we try to figure out within the search results that now we have which is your start product and the start product could be based on performance in terms of conversion number of clicks by orders add to carts etc and then we reorder the results by showing your best performing product up top okay and number four is your merchandising so we will take an example of say boosting for example normally what happens even and this happens again in solar or idf based solutions where your search results for a particular query are usually unnormalized idf so let's say for example i have this first shoe which the score of that is two point one six i want to boost that and want to show that at top so normally i'll boost using ten points but sometimes that's not enough in this case is example so i'll boost it by say a hundred points just to make sure that it shows up at top the problem is because this shoe gets boosted so much that when it's leastly relevant in some other query even in that query this product will start to show up at top so this is another problem that unbxd has solved by normalizing the idf so now if i wanted to boost this particular shoe i don't mostly to use random numbers i use relative percentages to boost so i can say if i want to show up at top i can boost it by 20% 50% if i want to show it up in the middle i made sure it by 20% if i want to bury it i can show it as 0% it will get buried at the bottom okay and here's a sort of a collection of all the different elements if you want to compare unbxd solution to any open-source architecture like solar or elastic search so what you get with solar or elastic search is the middle brown box out of the box that's it but to get a good or a great search solution you need all the blue boxes around it as well and that is what unbxd has done so starting from the top left we need to have an e-commerce context-aware solution so it actually can figure out that a woman's white jeans is a jeans and not a white top and then you have automated stemming spell check a synonym corpus to allow for a particular jargon in the industry bleeds into the autocomplete where you wants the system to guide the customer not necessarily just show categories or or keywords up top next in the top top-left corner sorry is the user behavior the dynamic faceting and i'll show you some of these examples and these personalized recommendations as well and then you have the infrastructure that scales automatically depending on what your traffic is and starts to use the real-time data to personalize and start personalizing the search results and last is the merchandising to apply the business rules so if you have inventory clearance if you have sale if you have new product launches and promotions or you might have partnerships with vendors that you might want to give preferential treatment you might have these merchandising requirements landing page requirements banners that you want to show and above all reporting in terms of what is it that after all these hard work did the analytics analytics say that you provided us conversionsright so this complete system is what makes up a good search solution any other questions gentleman.
rep,i hope i'm not going too fast or too slow just let me know if i need to change my pace please well go ahead perfect.
rep,if you have on probably some of the question that if addressing some of the questions that you had in terms of with the capabilities around you know the autosuggest and the relevancy and the zero results and how we come up with that.
rep,yeah is that is that giving you a little bit more clarity in terms of our capability and how we would have solve those some of those some of those questions you cut off completely didn't get that.
prospect,okay i said we can discuss at the end.
rep,okay i think i've heard you guys have you guys will have a discussion about it and have questions at the end.
rep,got it okay so i didn't think it's coming up a little bit muted so i probably caught some of the words okay so i'll keep up the pace and try to show you everything that we wanted to show you today so let's get into the business section we talked about the technology at a high level let's get into the business piece i want to give you guys a little bit of a preview as to how do we come up with the user experience from different verticals just give you the idea on the capabilities that we have so here's an example of a customer parts warehouse a huge a huge success story out of texas you know so they used to have a very specific requirement they sell parts to appliances and they started out by only selling vacuum cleaner parts now they're selling parts for all different appliances that you can find inside a home so they have two different ways or two different types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have right so if i let's say start to search for say this side as a vacuum cleaner what we did was we actually split the search results in the autocomplete to show parts on the left and models on the right so depending on which user they might be they can go either left or right it's a very different way of implementing stuff here's an apparel customer us patriot tactical or even if you go to express dot com which is one of our large customers we have a very unique way in terms of how apparel customers need to be engaged where if i start typing in say just ni for example how i want to make sure i start showing some of the most popular categories or products and provide different subcategories within that but also expose them to some products that they might have not thought about that are also available and sold on the site some top queries and some popular products that match the query string and all of this is driven by a machine learning algorithm that actually learns over time and starts to provide better results and here's another example of a grocery i know this is not necessarily strictly to your vertical but i wanted to show this because there might be a lot of repeat purchases on your site customers are coming in just to replenish maybe food or maybe medicine etc so this might might ring up ring true to you what your requirements are so what i wanted to show here is let's say if i started to search for say a chicken or this is what i typically buy from this site and if i am constantly buying let's say this chicken nuggets that is the first thing i'll start to see at top now specifically for grocery what we found that a lot of customers were searching going to the search results clicking on the product detail page and adding a product to cart right so what we found that if you bring those three components right here in the autocomplete we can show you what the weight of the product is the price give you the ability to change the quantity and add to cart from right here we can cut down on the number of clicks it would take for the customer to buy and by doing this design we were able to bring the clicks from 60 clicks it took to buy 15 products down to 20 but in case you're coming to buy products that you normally don't buy we also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories okay and this is just the autocomplete thats it okay next is the 12 the query types of relevance we showed you the example of how from a technology perspective we solve the the query relevance issue but what we've also done is we've written a master algorithm that actually understands the type of queries because different customers have different concentration of types of queries that we get so you might have a exact query or query spectrum that essentially defines what is the range of the product that you're looking at are you looking at a very specific product or a type of product or not even a product a query qualifier has keywords in it but actually ascertain a specific definition of that product say for example i'm looking for a blue collar for dogs right so it's blue is the feature that is defining for the collar that i'm looking for and query structure defines does it contain keywords that are used for natural language are there some linguistic shortcuts like i'm looking for a 60-inch tv let's say an electronics world etc that inch i could define as double quotes in inch etc right next is our spellcheck so unbxd has actually figured out to solve up to six keywords being misspelled in a single query and we do three things we obviously autocorrect it so here a black leather jacket for example is misspelled we correct it to the correct spelling of black leather jacket but and we will automatically will start showing results for black leather jacket in case black leather jacket had multiple auto corrections we'll also start showing those the third thing that we do is let's say we thought that black leather jacket has the first option for auto correction is what the most obvious is but customers start clicking on the second option over time the second option will automatically become the first option our machine learning system will learn and figure out that most customers are looking for the second option and that will become the primary option next by the way this is solved out of the box you do not insulate today i'm assuming conner from a business perspective and for the tech guys you constantly have to create synonyms for all the different variations of misspelling you do not have to do that with the unbxd solution unbxd solves 85 to 90 percent of spelling mistakes out of the box without you having to create any synonyms only when the customer really <butchers> the spelling where we have to actually create a synonym on the backend for that same thing with stemming today i'm assuming that for a lot of cases you have to create synonyms on the back end you do not have to create synonyms to solve stemming problems with unbxd it is automatically solved out of the box and but we also give you the ability to create synonyms so if you have plural stemming issues spellcheck all of that is automatically solves but you have some synonyms that you want we can also built in and give you the ability to create the synonyms and we give you the ability to create three types of synonyms bi-directional synonyms where you want to make sure that any keyword being searched you search for both keywords you need to replace synonyms and we'll show you some examples of that and some replacement synonyms automated redirect if you give us your taxonomy if a customer searches for something that matches exactly to a taxonomy you can automatically redirect that customer to that category page you do not have to create redirect rules manually within the system any questions gentleman.
rep,i just want to do a quick check i know you want to hold it to the end but i just wanted to make sure i took a pause.
prospect,just got one question about the machine learning your machine learning technique will be based on the user saw on <peko> only or is it based on the industry or is it based on the entire customer customer base that you have and clean your overall search engine in your hand or <the learning experience>.
rep,got it so the there's two components to that our machine learning algorithm has been trained on what we call is the world catalog so we we have created an index of almost 250 million products to train our machine learning algorithm however once that machine learning that algorithm is deployed on petco it gets trained on the petco catalog and then over time it is learning based on the petco analytics and clickstream data and any variations to the petco catalog we do not and this is a big no-no in the retail world we do not take your data and mix and match with any other retailers data to train the algorithm it is definitely based on your data and your data alone.
prospect,okay and how about the personalized experience like how do you train the <certain things> to pick up the personalized experience.
rep,got it so as part of the algorithm that picks up what the customer search for so for example let's say a particular customer has been constantly buying a particular type of products say it's dog products we know that they probably have dogs as a pet so very similar in the grocery example world if i am constantly buying multi packs is it because i have a bigger family etc so we try to create this personalization profiles of customers and try to make sure that the products that we show are based on those profiles and the personalization happens in real time it starts on three different dimensions one is the customer behavior second is the collaborative behavior which is data of other similar customers whether based on geography or whether based on buying patterns or based on seasonality and third is the catalogue behavior which products seem to be selling better which seems to be clicked more added to cart more etc the performance of those products so we combine the data for all three components for each experience for each personalization experience for each customer in real-time.
prospect,so that means i only the personalized experience only applied for the logged in user or that they also apply to the guest user.
rep,it is tracked using a cookie it's an anonymous cookie we do not collect any personalized information so it could be logged in or not logged in user as long as that cookie exists from one session to another if they obviously clear their cookies we won't be able to track them from one to the other but if you have a logged in user then we can and if you if you anonymously exchange the ids then we can track them from one login to another log in independent of a device or if they clear their cookies.
prospect,okay and in that case shall i when shall i have the solution as also tracking the analytics like somebody is a guest user or a logged in user the purchase history you will be able to track that as well tell others the experience for the for the customer.
rep,correct that is correct.
prospect,so if i if my session last if i check out after i check out i create a new session in that case my cookies will be the same or is it going to be different even though i'm the same customer.
rep,yeah so i mean as long as you've not cleared your cookies and we don't put any exploration data or cookies there really are it's pretty long six months or a year so as long as the cookies don't have not expired you've not cleared your cookies we will be able to track you from one session to the other now the question is.
prospect,if i come across my two different device by using my laptop or mobile would that be same cookie or the different cookie.
prospect,.<>
rep,it will definitely be a different cookie so the idea is if you're if don't log in on either devices then we may not be there's some fuzzy match that we do based on ip addresses but then again if it's a residential ip address it's a little bit more accurate versus if it's a corporate ip address it's not really so much so there's some fuzziness to is that we apply but if you're not a logged in user it becomes a little fuzzy in terms of tracking you from device to device and but if you are a logged in user then based on that exchange of that anonymous id we would be able to track you from one device to the other.
prospect,i see and once the personalization experience fixed in does that mean my customer a and customer b even though they search for the same search term they might see a different result that because of the personalized experience.
rep,absolutely a good example would be i am i'm a dog a pet owner and you're a cat pet owner and if i buy dog food constantly and you buy cat food constantly and we're just looking for you know food or pet food obviously mine will come up with dog food yours will come up with cat food.
prospect,i see.
rep,that's a little generic example but lets say we both are dog lovers and we both buy pet food but i have a ants brand affinity and that's what i keep buying all the time and you probably buy while buffalo brands we might actually see different results in that instance.
prospect,okay i am planning to apply api call to make that search request is that from the server side or is that from client side.
rep,.<>
rep,so we have two approaches as to how you can do that we have a ajax based solution where you can do a browser-based call with the search results are rendered using ajax but we also have a back-end solution where you can configure the wc search xml file and call instead of your solar api call you can call the unbxd api's so we have both ways where we can implement search from.
prospect,we are doing that by we do enable like cookies caches like that given that you have a personalized experience kicks in and thats what we advice the caching strategy in this case.
rep,yeah absolutely so i mean it makes sense because today you are probably caching because the search results are does not change from one user to the other or from session to session and it also produces the hits that you have on your servers but if you want to start getting personalized even if it was not personalized for example just our user behavior based changes for a particular query the search results can change what is the frequency with which you clear the cache or the refresh for the cache happens.
prospect,we do it daily.
rep,once a day.
rep,oh got it so i think that to begin with let's say for example if if caching is important in your minds we could start with just the relevancy piece and the user behavior can kick in slowly for purchase to speak and you guys can then a/b tested or however you guys decide to do a poc you can a/b test and say okay just with cashing involved is unbxd performing better than what you guys have today and if it does then you can decide and say okay to improve the next level should we probably increase the cash refresh to twice a day or three times a day or one once every hour and then eventually if the performance in terms of the speed with which we are able to deliver results is fast enough then you can start not cashing the search results so you can slowly progress into that state where you can decide and say should we cash or not cash as long as the performance holds as to what your expectations are and obviously from our sla's will obviously be around 300 milliseconds or less so you know we can slowly progressively go into that state where there's no caching but if you guys obviously want to maintain cache in the beginning this is how we can approach that.
prospect,okay if we approve provide an a/b testing capability.
rep,well we we have a/b capability within our system as a as a product feature that we're coming up with but not the way you are expecting you're expecting your search results versus ours so for that we would have to rely on some capability that you guys have.
prospect,okay okay yeah i am just thinking if show might be the business they might be doing some tuning for a search and they might want to a/b tested configurations.
rep,yeah so so there's two different components of a/b testing so let's say today you guys use solar and you want to test solar versus unbxd let's say that's definitely your capability some somewhere you have to get your a/b tested now to just to cover that piece you could also do a before and after or a period versus period comparison so there's ways to do that if you guys don't have any a/b testing capability but as part of the product is concern in the near future in the next couple of months we're coming up with a capability where you will be able to do a/b testing between two merchandising decisions let's say for example you guys decide conner business team decides and says we have a query called let's say a simple query dog food for dog food we have two different ideas from a couple of different merchants how can we test two different merchandising ideas you will be able to define a particular percentage of traffic that goes with merchandising a percentage of traffic that goes merchandising b maybe some percentage of traffic direct goes to the algorithm etc and you'll be able to see what the results are so that capability is coming i would say in the next 60 days.
rep,end of end of march and i'll show you a quick video of what that capability will look like if you guys are interested in that  i'm so sorry your voice is breaking up i can't hear the question.
prospect,we're using my computer so might be a microphone issue can you hear me okay.
rep,i can hear you yes.
prospect,so if you're making changes in the ui is it possible to get the analytics based on your changes so like if i go and decide to do something just to ask you is there a way to quantify or measure the change that i make.
rep,absolutely let me just show you what my dashboard looks like so this will answer this question very clearly so this is what our as soon as you login to our dashboard this is what it looks like it gives you from the top here you can manage multiple sites if you have your test staging etc or maybe even multiple properties that petco might have but here's our reporting section and within search you will be able to let me just take you there i'm sorry i'm at a hotel today traveling so my internet is little shaky so bear with me okay here we go so here for a particular time frame you can see what my search results performance is where queries versus clicks if i want to see a daily trend weekly monthly if i want to see a funnel in terms of let's see if i wanted to a see funnel what my total hits were clicks carts orders okay my typical funnel so this is your overall search performance it also gives you what are your top search queries top zero results queries top clicked products top ordered products but then if i wanted to get into a specific query so let's say this is a apparel site we've put together for a demo purposes so all the queries you might see are are apparel related let's say i wanted to merchandise dresses as a query normally for the same time frame i can see what the performance of dresses is how many hits did i get ctr clicks carts orders etc one point before i go further detail into this what kind of analytics do you guys use google coremetrics omniture.
prospect,coremetrics.
rep,coremetrics got it so typically depending on how coremetrics or even google or omniture are deployed a lot of times they might be overstating what the actual search conversion might be i'll give you an example let's say i search for dog food i didn't get good results for example and then i navigated to dog and then dog food and i clicked on the category on the navigation and ended up buying the product that i wanted to buy what coremetrics might end up saying is that that search session had a conversion so you might think that dog food had a conversion but in reality dog food did not have a conversion right so this is where unbxd actually tracks a one-to-one correlation if i search for dog food and i do not buy from search that conversion is not attributed to the query dog food so our conversions per query is actually usually reports smaller than what coremetrics or omniture would typically report so now that that being said i could now come in and say that okay dresses is converting i'd say three point five two percent i can drill down into that query and look at again the same analysis that i was seeing at the overall query level what is my trend over time so let's say on 15th of january i made some merchandising changes and the search results actually went down and i made some more changes on the sixteenth and it actually went back up i can actually see what that trend changed looks like and i can also see what my funnel would look like as to how many hits clicks carts and orders did i actually get from this particular query for that time frame that's the am i is that the question you were asking conner.
prospect,can you can you work at excuse specific query or specific experiences metrics.
rep,absolutely so i was a going to exactly show you that also so for the dresses query which are the products that actually show up for this query and what is their performance is also tracked in that particular query report so here for this dress if i just scroll down i'll see these are my most popular products this is a product id what clicks carts and orders are for that product in the context of the query dresses is also tracked and we are coming up with another report which is going to be specific products so you can then go into a specific product and see what the performance of that product is in the same metric what was its trend over time and what was its funnel over time how many product hits did that product get clicks cart carts orders etc i hope that was the question connor i was able to answer that.
prospect,yeah that did help thank you.
prospect,how many how many environment you guys support while we have multiple non production environment so as are you able to support like multiple non production environment or is this a one production environment.
rep,no we can absolutely supply multiple as you can see in this drop-down that i showed you i'll give you the example h h gregg for for example they're also in wcs they i think you use 12 environments because they have two or three dev environments two or three staging then stage prop etc then a qa you know so different environments as many as you need in order to support the development and promote production promotion activities.
prospect,okay will be more like we sending you the data or is it something that you guys can fetch our catalogue and coordinate as well.
rep,got it so fetching the catalog we can do a couple of different ways i prepared a quick overview i'll just go through some of the other stuff to give you guys an idea okay here you go so the unbxd integrations requires three steps one is the catalog sync obviously it index the catalog second is deploying the analytics and third is obviously powering the search so the catalog indexing one of the approaches we've taken is and i don't know do you guys use something called quicklinks within wcs i think it's called quicklinks.
rep,perfect so with quicklinks you guys can structure what i believe its like a tool that sort of snippets or scripts that you can run in sequence right so there might be a script called staging prop that actually pushes to master solar and then if everything looks okay then it does an index prop and pushes it to production solar which might be slave solar am i somewhere near where you guys is that how you guys do it.
prospect,yeah thats correct.
rep,okay fantastic so what we have done is we insert a small unbxd script between your staging prop and your indexing prop so here let's say staging prop gets fired it pushes any changes that the merchants have done any catalog changes whatever the merchants may have been doing into your master solar right then step two it will fire in unbxd script what this under unbxd script does is it takes the solar from the master solar the catalog and pushes it to the unbxd sftp and second it calls an unbxd api to start uploading from unbxd sftp to the unbxd index and then that staging prop finishes then you have indexing prop it starts will give you another script that actually checks the status of that unbxd upload so it will either say it is still working or it's complete like a success once it fires the success you can do your prod prop may be a typo there i apologize it's a prod prop and a slave solar push and then you can as last step you can do your clear cache etc and basically get that particular changes into production and this is exactly how we do it with the check today and the start to finish from the script getting fired in step two within staging prop to step two in indexing prop for about 45000 products takes about roughly seven to eight minutes by the way how big is the catalog for petco just out of curiosity.
prospect,20 thousand 22 to 25 thousand items.
rep,oh 20 to 25 thousand perfect so you should be able to still maintain do that less than 10 minute time frame in which we can finish the entire index and so you guys are also synced we are also synced and then you can do a production prop from that perspective.
rep,alright i am sorry was there a question i'm sorry i didn't hear that yes go ahead.
prospect,yeah in the previous screen if you go to the in the integration so the step one master solar means do we need to have a solar instance in in wcs site.
rep,so i am assuming yeah so i'm assuming that you already have one that is powering your search today and your category pages so let's say unbxd is only powering your search you still want to maintain that master solar to power your category pages.
rep,so as long as you need to power those category pages using the solar you maintain that master solar we do as a product have a solution that powers category pages also something that i can show you as a quick video and until that point in time if you maintain the master solar that's helpful you don't have to this is an approach we do not obviously have to follow this but because you will be maintaining a solar instance for your category pages this seems to be the best way to coordinate a simultaneous release to production so that your category pages and search pages have the exact same information.
rep,i'm sorry i'm not sure if somebody's asking a question or it's a sidebar but.
prospect,how about the ui integrations like it goes through our solar right like from there we call unbxd.
rep,got it so i have two approaches to do the search results integration one is called we call the ajax template or second is the backend connector so on the ajax template it's pretty straightforward you could give us a page you do the header you do the footer and put our ajax scripts and we'll print the entire search results in the middle so let's say for example i'll just do a quick search here let's say dog kennel so let's say this was assume this is a search results and everything from here to here until this banner is your header so you print that page everything below here to here is your footer you print that page everything in the middle an ajax script can come in and display the results and will display the results exactly what your ui shows today exactly the way it does today the colors the fonts the style etc so that's one approach the second approach is using the back end where what we do is within your wcs there's a configuration file called wc search dot xml what you do is you create a unbxd profile and specifically make a call instead to your your solar you make an api call to unbxd and our responses will be exactly like your solar responses so we've modified our responses to mimic your solar responses so application doesn't know any difference and basically you get the search results and then you basic and you take those search results and you apply all the rules that you normally apply to your search results from solar and display it on the website let's say you have any filtering that you apply any facets that you want to hide or not show all of that you can apply and then straight inside.
prospect,so you guys created a new profile which called the unbxd api.
rep,correct that is correct yep.
rep,i think it's the term is and i'm not the expert on wcs but i think the term is called search expressions where you create this profile different profiles yeah yep hopefully did i answer that question i just wanted to make sure if there's any follow-up to that okay.
prospect,yeah i'm good.
prospect,can you hear me okay.
rep,yes i can hear you.
prospect,if i if someone does a search for dog food for instance on what have the capacity to realize that person is dog customer so whenever they search maybe toy or something like that they're getting they're getting products that are gonna be relevant to them that's correct like you guys can do that right.
rep,correct so the way we did this i am assuming this is connor because i'm starting to make the sound voices tied to the names so i'll give you a a apparel example just in parallel so let's see if i go to express we've not turned this on for express what i wanted to give you a parallel just to simplify the answer let's say i started to navigate on men's products okay and then if i search for the tops or t-shirts or shirts i want to make sure that i actually show men's shirts right now there's an assumption an inherent assumption that because i navigated through men's category i might be a male and i want to show men's shirt what we do is we don't blanket these search results with men's shirts because we may be wrong it's possible that a woman came in was searching for men's products for her husband for her boyfriend whatever and now wants to buy something for herself and she just happened to search something so we we do take that into consideration to say that the experience in real time was on men's products so we show a little bit more men's products we but we also mix in women's products in there now let's say i was looking at 10 men's products instead of just one that's a very strong signal that i'm really interested in men's products in that instance if i now search for shirts or tops or t-shirts we will actually show a lot more men's product than women's products so it's a it's a progressive scale depending on how much attribution or or the activity that the customer has done can strongly suggest one direction one particular type of customer versus the other because you don't you know you don't want to assume and be wrong because i might look at one dog product and if we assume that you are dog customer and we show all dog products and no cat products and certainly i might be on the side to give it as a gift to somebody possibly you know i mean i know dog lovers and cat lovers can't mingle but let's assume they can and so we try to mix it up a little we don't try to do all guns blazing but if i saw ten dog products i might show a lot more dog products than cat products versus if i just shopped one dog product.
prospect,right understood okay.
rep,and the reason i wanted to explain this connor in the apparel example is because you know dog lovers and cattle overs might not see it that way but we just don't want to necessarily risk it that way either.
rep,perfect awesome.
prospect,also do you have any questions.
prospect,i think william and <> has got any doubt.
prospect,okay perfect alright well thank you guys so much.
prospect,excuse me for going one second sorry so based on this document right the integration looks very simple so what is your typical wcs integration time line you have seen with past clients.
rep,so we typically see the fastest we've seen is four to six weeks the longest we've seen is six to eight weeks the difference is between how much configuration the business wants so let's say for example on the autocomplete you know if there's a lot of customization or a lot of different variety of things that the customer is looking for the retailer is looking for it takes a little bit more design a little more more testing etc so it goes into eight weeks but if it is pretty straightforward pretty cut cut through it can be done within four to six weeks which includes testing integration qa uat and any production related cycle that you need to look into so four to six has been pretty aggressive but we've been able to do that yes.
prospect,because the document that you are showing me or the slide that you showed me i mean from integration taking it integration point of view it looks pretty simple in a within a week i can do this changes for you and get our production environment or production up and running but i'm assuming then most of the time is involved in testing.
rep,correct so two parts i am assuming this is chandra is that correct did i get the name right.
rep,okay so chandra this does sound straightforward obviously but let's say there might let's say for example the solar response that you guys get maybe there's some configuration change that you're doing to the solar response so the application is getting a slightly different response and we might not know that but once we provide our response you might say oh you know this is something you might have to do that's one second is the design stuff like i mentioned from a business perspective a third is any kind of work that we need to do from unbxd standpoint to run the algorithms to run the processing of the catalog etc that takes a little bit of time a setting of the relevancy etc testing and then the last piece is the analytics so this gives you the integration to get us the catalog this gives us the integration for the search results but we also need to integrate the analytics and for analytics we do we take slightly one step further where we actually like to track every single click that the customer makes so there's there the deployment is straight for the testing does increase a little bit in terms of time.
rep,but yes as far as the integration goes it is it we've tried to simplify the retailer's it time can be as minimal as possible so i'm glad you said that it will take a week is awesome.
rep,so so connor in terms of our next steps if we can spend a couple minutes on what your thoughts are i mean what we can definitely do is send you this this information that you have it but also kind of discuss a poc and what that entails in terms of being able to test the capabilities that we have everything kind of outlined in this conversation and hopefully get some additional information from you in terms of your new your unique search sites your conversions and things like that so that we could properly put an roi together for you as well is that something that we could start the dialogue on or what's your thoughts on next steps.
prospect,yeah i think we'll regroup internally but i think we will eventually want to have a poc and talk about how we can test it internally on our staging environment and really see what the business side of using this tool would be and what it would involve and we can get back to you in terms of the timeline of that but certainly we do want it for that dialogue.
rep,okay and were you able to get the questions around the information that i sent the site search.
prospect,yeah yeah i also note those for you so you can you can have those that it's taken me so long that way.
rep,yeah about those around that as well and that we can have discussion monal is there anything that you want to add in terms of the poc and how we go about that it all we have the other folks on the line.
rep,yeah the only question i had was do you guys have any a/b testing tool today that you use or will you plan it to do more like a before after test.
prospect,cool when you say it'd be nothing to you means like testing the the behavior between solar versus maybe unbxd that may be on top is that what you are asking.
rep,correct something like an optimizely or you know web visual web optimizer something some tool that allows you to split the traffic into web yep.
prospect,we do this mana tate a/b testing but i also i am already in this world in the <vine> for like helping like live in search engine behavior.
rep,so if you do a front-end based implementation we could use mana tate there's a structure we do that on route 21 today if you go to route 21 they are also using mana tate to do an a/b test although they are on atg they are not on wcs but as you know mana tate is more on the front end where they can change the the the html snippets you can change the functionality of how the form on the search the search form action field is so that when you hit search it actually goes to a slightly different page and that different page can in turn called unbxd versus your internal solar so there's a way we could we could test that out but if not if that won't work we could obviously do a before and after for sure.
rep,and i know conner you said in terms of timing you'll get back to allen just from my purposes are you looking at some high-level timeline can you give us some guidance on what that looks like this is a q1 project q2 project just just to that i know.
prospect,we haven't discussed that internally right now we're just testing out front parties are and just betting see what would it our needs the best and right now there hasn't been any discussion around budget or any timeline of implementation right now we're just exploring and agreeing now what what we're what we want and also what would be required its only exploratory phase.
rep,okay what other vendors have you looked at at this point.
prospect,say that again.
rep,what other vendors have you looked at at this point.
prospect,so right now we're working or where we're talking to a bloom reach group by and another company called reflection.
rep,okay and we can discuss how we're it were different in those and and where are you in that stage have you done demos with them as well.
rep,we've had demos we've had conversations but we haven't we haven't done any testing with them.
rep,just out of curiosity what the team of what's your take on what you've seen with them and what we've kind of presented today in terms of capabilities and and feeling you know the value around what you're looking for from our business perspective.
prospect,the integration level is simple in this side on unbxd thats the one major point.
rep,did you say the integration seems a lot simpler in unbxd versus the other okay anything in terms of maybe merchandising piece and that was important to you.
prospect,from looking at group by they have their service is kind of an all-in-one where you pay and you get merchandising and the search and whereas bloom reach is more of a split service and reflection is reflection seems to be like the most like complicated platform because it it has really in dept personalization and it is a lot of off-site data so if someone you know looking on amazon or doing a google search around for a dog for instance before you get to their website reflection the platform is going to know that it can customize the home page specifically for for what you're looking for you get to petco and you automatically see dog products you're not seeing hamster so that's kind of a cool feature and other than that there's a lot of similarities and i think you know in terms of working with the dashboard adapting to rules one of the things they did on a side note another thing i did see with unbxd that's that's more interesting to me is that out of the box there is no rule that you have set up for stemming and for the spelling or plural or anything like that so but yeah i think that we're really interested and testing it out for ourselves if that's possible and just so we can have a play like you know this you only have an hour or so to do a demo and you might not know all the questions that you need to ask or you might not know what you don't know the that that's kind of why we're we're aiming to get a staging environment set up with with these tools.
rep,appreciate that that just out of curiosity why is this important to you that is driven by the customers that you guys are getting feedback from or you guys looking at improve conversions why is this important to you guys i could make some assumptions but i'd rather hear from from you guys as to as to why this.
prospect,yeah obviously obviously conversion is usually the main reason for for anything on a website but just internally we can see that our searches are you know they're not as as advanced as you know our competitors and some of our data is bad so if we have a machine learning tool it can help us automate a lot of it's improving the quality of our search or site experience i think that's the main the main reason is to obviously conversion but also being that that brand like having confidence in the petco brand that we know like what to recommend for apparents.
rep,got it and is this is this a line item on the you know yearly kind a to do list of accomplishments for you and maybe your vp and and the team in terms of assuring that this is something that you know gets done this this year.
prospect,yeah this is something that i don't know the specific dates of the timeline hadn't been a part of those conversation but we are i do know that it's an interest from the executive level that they do want this to be part of the the improvement for our website so on site search in general it's not necessarily going to a different platform or whatever it but it is about improving that experience and.
rep,so it does have some executive eyeballs and sponsorship.
prospect,certainly yeah.
rep,in terms of you and i following back up we could do by a couple days or is it about.
prospect,let let us regroup in internally and and i think there's things we need to discuss but i'll send you an email probably wednesday or thursday and we can do follow-up.
rep,and i think the other part connor and allen i think the other part you also should probably take into consideration is connor as part of our our poc we in fact guarantee an improvement in performance so it's not just that oh here we think ten percent improvement we will actually guarantee it correct.
prospect,okay perfect good to know yep.
rep,absolutely and i and the other part is i heard that you might have been looking at other vendors and stuff and i know we didn't get a chance to cover all the different aspects of our product but if you if allen and connor if you get in guys can also for a business perspective connor at least i know the tech guys probably got their handful of information today but there are a lot of components from a business side that we didn't get a chance to get into like the whole merchandising piece not just the analytics for how do you merchandise right you talked about good buys capabilities or blue cheese capabilities so we just wanted to see if you can give us some more time maybe another half an hour 45 minutes to show you that and to show you what's in our pipeline that we are coming up in the next 60 days in terms of the business merchandising capabilities that i think is going to really impress you as well.
prospect,we can we can find some time later this week i don't i don't think the it guys needed you guys don't really need the merchandising stuff okay oh yeah i you can have some of my time later this week and also in over a few a few times fought that we can discuss on the topic.
prospect,hey connor on that note can you include even christina's team so that they can ask some requirement about seo.
rep,and what is christina's team.
prospect,i mean they're the merchandising team who actually manages some seo yeah it will be christina.
rep,connor just as a small request is it possible to get some availability early next week rather than this week.
prospect,yeah that would be fine.
prospect,yeah sure you guys can come on in.
rep,really awesome alright.
prospect,okay and guys one more one more final question sorry i'm always in the last.
rep,no problem at all.
prospect,so how does this work if we have bad data say for example our catalog information there is a lot of data issues is it is it going to be pretty bad or we need to clean up or is it something that you guys do some kind of clean up on top of our catalog or how does this work.
rep,got it so i'll give you a couple of examples chandra i think this was chandra asking the question i'll give you a couple of examples of how we address a bad data because i mean obviously we can't address all types of bad data but i'll give you an example with us patriots so us patriots problem was that the products that they had it's you know three armed three divisions of the military army navy and air force and you can't combine some of these products when you're starting to show results the problem they used to have is they did not have good attribution data for example color was always in the title but never as an attribute some types of size some other types of attributions like installation etc what we were able to do was when we got there once we got there catalog if there was a very logical reasoning behind extracting attributes so they'll say oh these are the types of colors you can get these are the types of attributes from installation or weather resistant etc that you can get we were able to extract that and then create those attribution and give it back to them so now you we can now power the facets the filters the relevance is lot better etc so there's some extent to which how we can help improve the data and that there's obviously a third party's whose bread and butter is to do this like index i don't know if you guys have heard of them there's a couple of a couple of them out there and they do this as a professional services where you give them their catalog your catalog and they'll give you back an attribution based data that becomes if you have lots of problems but if there are some peripheral problems or some problems that can be logically solved we can certainly help you guys do that as well as a first level hopefully hopefully that answers your question chandra.
prospect,yeah yeah i mean yep that's good.
rep,okay perfect any other questions.
prospect,i have so where do you guys it's a cloud based application and unbxd is hosted on cloud or you guys have it on a server in a different places.
rep,no it is in we have hosted on aws.
rep,and it's a distributed system across three data centers that the aws has in the us and we also used their cdn for all our stylesheet javascript files etc.
prospect,so is it is that separate aws instance for us for our account alone or is it going to be a shared account.
rep,oh it is absolutely going to be a dedicated instance we don't share any retailer's information or data across across things.
prospect,and we can scale it when say for example for holidays right we can scale it as much as we want correct.
rep,absolutely you and you we what we'll also do is as part of our integration let's say maybe not for the poc but once we go 100 percent live as soon as we go live there's a process we call holiday testing compatibility tests etc that we do during august and september we will give you our own internal numbers that we've tested for load test index tests etc spikes versus elongated tests etc and we also give you the opportunity if you guys do such load testing on our system so you can also test it and see if you are holiday ready or not for example i'll give you for example express and some other large retailers during their peak say for example just pic pick up a number an average they might have 10 queries per second at at a peak level what we test our systems at is about 180 queries per second at a spike test and a sustained load test.
rep,if you guys do those same tests we will give you the we will give you the opportunity to do that as well.
rep,i got a quick question for the just now the tech team overall in terms of what you guys have heard and seen in the last an hour and a half you guys see any red flags any issues are you good with how the implementation would work or poc would work just want want to get some clarity on that as well.
prospect,no i mean the integration looks a lot simpler than we we definitely would like to do some kind of poc to see if it makes sense for us if that is possible from your end some kind of a test account or something that we can play around with in terms of red flags except for the product data or the catalogue data i think you are using our own petco index or the solar index and that is what you guys are using it but on top of it once since you're going to respond back with almost the same results as the solar that is doing it today we might have some customization that we might need to unwind or make some adjustment on your end to make that happen or you get the expected results so that's the only thing i see right now but other than that i mean on the technical side but on the business side i would like still like connor to review his requirement to see if it meets all your all the use cases.
rep,agreed agreed monal did you have any answers to that or any thoughts on that. yeah i just yeah i definitely want to cover from a data perspective chandra by the way while we take your solar index we re-index that data the way we distribute the data on our side so it's not a copy of the solar index for saving we're just taking your index as a data input but we massage that data which is why like the spelling mistakes or the stemming issues you guys don't have to create synonyms for that's automatically get solves because the way we index that data so that's number one number two is if there are certain requirements from your perspective where you see challenges we can certainly address that from how we index it so that's two the third piece was in terms of the responses if like i said are we usually respond are our api responses are in json or xml so what we can what we have done for specifically for wcs is to make sure that the responses look natively like a solar response so if you have done any modifications you can let us know and we can apply the same modifications on our end so you don't have to change any application on your end we can take that our team can take that up as long as you can provide us some guidance on what those changes are and that is not a problem at all that is we are more than happy to take take that from our perspective.
rep,thank you guys are go ahead monal.
rep,thanks monal that <> any other any additional questions.
prospect,definitely thank you so much.
rep,alright thanks guys.
rep,alright thanks guys appreciate the time.
rep,and like that unfortunately allen is no longer with us but the what we wanted to do mary first of all thank you for sending us the numbers as you did we really appreciate you doing a little of the legwork or making a legwork again but i wanted to clarify a few things so what we wanted to do today is walk you through just to give you a background in terms of what we do a quick you know 60-second overview what are the different components and products that we have and specifically walk you through the numbers and shows how we are approaching this and how we are aligning ourselves to the business along with the incentives that it would be if you're able to help increase the business.
rep,so give you a background of your six year old company using product discovery and what which means of projects of you for e-commerce which means when a customer is on the e-commerce site what are the different ways they can discover products one is taxonomy the category pages next to site search and third is the personalised product recommendation and we have three distinct product to help the customer so we're over journey they take .
rep,now for a lot of customers we sometimes do this <> hard and sometimes we bundled it depending on the interest that the customers might have in the different products .
rep,so to understand the fit of background from kiyona's perspective mary i know you guys are using a vendor for a search and are you guys using the vendor for recommendations also or is that something you guys are doing in-house today.
prospect,we also use a vendor for recommendations as well.
rep,got it so the way we were approaching this is you're already paying 2 different vendors i don't know if its two different vendors of the same vendor but i'm assuming it's two different vendors and what we're proposing is if you can see my screen for two things i wanted to validate one was the site search was the conversation that we had with kim in the past and we specifically focused on that but it does turn out that site search in terms of the volume that you have on the site is pretty small because if the numbers you gave us your overall site traffic is 165 k per month.
rep,right work this site search with only 2500 per month that is probably like 2% or so lisbon's less than 2 percent i'm not mistaken and because it is just a small volume any kind of convert conversion in opelousas etc would be a long and tall order however we also have a machine learning product for category pages where depending on which geography the customer comes from what device they're using what seasonality channel etc we have a machine learning algorithm for category pages also so what i wanted to present was two different components one was these are your current numbers right so let's say you have 165 k in traffic today 1.5 percent in conversion per month and an average order value of at 175 so roughly it is about 433000 dollars in monthly revenue overall five right .
rep,so what we wanted to propose was if you were to use all three of our products let's say it's the category pages site search and our personalised product recommendation and what we would come in and guarantee is at least a five percent improvement in conversion it could be more boo-boo letís get into somewhere between five and ten if we are able to do at least five percent we are bringing in about twenty one thousand dollars in incremental revenue for which we would only charge two thousand dollars essentially bringing a 11x roi.
rep,but we also align ourselves to the business so we would come in and say let's say we continue to work with you and we try to push the envelope towards ten or fifteen percent which again at fifteen percent we're bringing in sixty four thousand dollars incremental revenue and we only asked for an increment of another two thousand at fifteen x or y but this gives you the ability to use all three of our product and we are incentivize only if we make you more money.
rep,let's see if you're not able to do 5% okay now we are let's say doing 4.
rep,5% better you still might going to use us but you only pay us $1200 insted of 3000 now i don't know what you're paying your other vendors today and if you were to combine the two vendors and the cost for them and don't know how far we are but what we wanted to do was we wanted to combine all products which typically range at thousand a piece and depend based on your volume one of the products will be around 2000 so the normal price would be around 4000 we are right now willing to do for the opportunity a 50% price guarantee but also an improvement in conversion .
prospect,and i'm sorry could you i had somebody come in and i missed that part of the conversation so if you were to not be able to hit that 5% incremental increase.
prospect,for it what would the what would the rate be.
rep,it would be somewhere around $1200 and we'll put that in writing today you only give a $1200 if you don't do 5% but you still continue to use all three products.
prospect,okay so would this be like rolling evaluated each month in terms of how much so it could fluctuate so if one month you happen to jen your services happened to generate you know 15% increase in that month would be 4000 and if it were to drop back down to under 5% the following month it would then go back down to 1200 is that.
rep,so the idea.
prospect,rate would be fluctuating.
rep,right so we can't guarantee on a fluctuating fluctuating basis mary because let's say q and i increases prices or you have some inventory issues whatever either all of our control what we guarantee you do a poc you do a test 60 days or 90 day poc within that time frame which we demonstrate this off sick so that establishes the price point and after that you can continually evaluate us but the price point does not change because there might be certain instances where it's out of our control so we can't guarantee it obviously but we can guarantee within a 60 day time period because we can estimate that there won't be tremendous variations around it and within 60 days or 90 days we could guarantee that time frame i did something and during that time frame.
rep,any thoughts on any feedback mary in terms of let's start with the cost piece i understand it's two thousand four thousand forget about the cost component of it so what we might charge if you're doing object how far are we with your current vendor at three thousand mark combining the both search and recommendations.
prospect,recommendations on the on the site so looking at both services you guys are still coming in pretty high as of right now for product recommendations on the site we're at a thousand dollars i think it's like it's a little shy of a thousand dollars it's like nine ninety five or something like that a month and then for the site search we are only paying a thousand dollars.
rep,got it so we are we'r pretty much giving you three products for the price let's do that these currents are you're getting three of them .
prospect,great so i mean you know part of you know if you could elaborate a little bit on the category pages and how that would be integrated <> that's it seems like that's the one feature that it's kind of standing out in terms of what we currently don't have right now to be candid we are kind of exploring that with our product recommendation vendor and turned out of having them integrate more within our category pages so if you can kind of demonstrate to me like what your services does that would be great.
rep,absolutely so when we talk about the category pages you think about the taxonomy right you have your new arrivals most loved dresses separate etc and if i were to let's say go to the dresses category and alistair got a little cocktail dresses okay.
rep,and the product assortment that i see right now so as a first-time user or a brand new visitor i might see a certain product assortment and the idea behind this is based on my interaction with the site so i might start clicking on let's say the first dress or the sixth dress where did i come from what geography do that comes up what other customers based on that geography time of the year which products are trending for this particular category page in that geography time of the day i will we will start restoring this product listing page to show the best performing products up top .
rep,and then as soon as i start to interact with the result so i might go in and say i want to look at this particular product so based on what the customer is searching or interacting with so if i look at the colour if i look at the price point inside look at a size we continuously start providing better personalised results that for that same category page without you having to manually do any of that work so that's the personalization component that we bring to the table for the category page and now let's say if i clicked on a particular size or somehow i filter the result set then let's say i went back to some other category.
rep,how can i take the input or the signals that we collected from that customer when they were interacting with something else and start providing better optimised assortment of products on this page and then on top of that so this is a personalization engine on top of that you also get the ability to overwrite this where you can create multitude of components around how a customer will actually see the different product assortment based on what you want as from a business perspective let's say i'm going to open that real quick for you let's say you have let's say you have new arrivals coming up or you have high inventory of certain products you want to get rid of but you also want to make sure that only certain percentage or certain segments of customers in get influenced.
rep,you can create segmentation strategies who our merchandising console where you can say i want to do it based on device i want to do it based on state geography collection of state co-state warm states etc and override the algorithm for a certain campaign that you might be doing still let's say you want to do an email campaign i'll give an example what express does express would send a specific email to their loyalty customer let's say and polka dot dresses dresses is something coming up in style and they want to promote that but they want their loyal customers to see those dresses up front before anybody else sees them but they also want the customers to have the same type of experience not actually just a landing page experience right so they'll send polka dot dresses in an email as though it's like the hero offers when the customers click on that link they come to the dresses category.
rep,they'll see polka dot dresses up top however any other customer who comes to the site and goes to the dresses category will last people can dress polka dot dresses dresses up top they'll see the normal product assortment based on who they are or whatever the collaborative aspect of the personalization aspect that's the engine would figure out.
rep,but the loyal customers were clicking on that email will come and see polka dot dresses.
rep,so you have a lot of control where the algorithm automatically tries to figure out what the best performing products are but also you have the ability to override it using our merchandising <>.
rep,and then we provide tons of analytics around it where you get to see and i'll show you real quick here sorry i'm using a sort of a tethering internet over my phone a little bit slow but you will get to see a lot of analytics from a path perspective that the customer take.
rep,so you know how many pages did it take how many click carts orders and it's inversion rates that happen for that category page what are my top page views my top click products any top order product you can also get to individual page level reporting and see the funnel of that individual page so what are my views ctr clicks cart orders conversion percentage and revenue per page bing view so you can now also determine which is your best performing page and how you might want to drive that traffic to that page and what kind of campaigns you might want to do around it so sort of the data will help you also figure out what marketing campaigns you want to do.
rep,and you can drill down into an individual product page or that category page again see what the funnel looks like based on whatever time frame you choose and what products perform on that paperwork click for that individual product for a cart order etc.
rep,so this is how you are able to now not just search because search is only 2% of your traffic now we're talking about 98 percent of the traffic how can we make sure that we leverage the personalization algorithm to individually serve those customers but also from a marketing top of the funnel in the middle of the funnel give you the control to influence for the customer sees as well.
rep,and so you get all of this for the same cost that you have today you get to test it if you don't perform you actually save money i'm not performing we perform badly you don't have to use that obviously but we still outperform your existing tools but not to the same guarantee that he wants to you save money but you still get the leverage out of it.
rep,and if they're performing better than your existing tools .
rep,but we will put with where are our food where our mouth is so to speak and i was trying to say something else and i tongue was slipped there but what i wanted to say mary is that we want to align ourselves to your business and not just for here to here the cost and an invoice mary thank you very much we constantly get involved in your business so let's say we deploy this 60 days 90dayst we out performing we give you what we perform that and an ongoing basis what is it that we'll do on an ongoing basis.
rep,every month and every quarter we review what these products are doing is let's if site search we're finding certain things that are not working we'll fix them if we understand how why they're not working if you don't understand them we'll reach out to you we collaboratively work with you to give you an idea as to how we are doing where we are struggling how we can fix them if you don't know how to fix them work with you to figure out what your ideas might be and then go ahead check them.
rep,and so it's not just here take our product and thank you very much we're constantly in wall which is why we're not the cheapest but we because we also deliver we like to be incentivized on the delivery with a better price and we also give back on an ongoing basis pay for that.
prospect,i need.
rep,an example go ahead go ahead.
prospect,so when you're yeah no problem so when you're looking at conversion um could you tell me is that like is there like a specific attribution window that's associated with that or is a same-day it's like as soon as somebody interacts with one of your recommendations does that automatically get attributed as you know your sale as that i'm trying to figure out like exactly how how you'd be tracking the product recommend boards on the category pages because it seems like i mean that's how people navigate our site right so.
prospect,naturally everybody is going to have to go to a category page in order to click through to a product and add it to their part and convert so the end essentially you would be saying that every every single person who hits a category page would then essentially be captured your customer and the sale would be attributed to to unbxd so i'm just trying to understand how you guys would measure that.
rep,look that's a good question so one of the best ways to measure that is to do an a/b test so if you don't have an a/b testing tool we can figure something out in terms of how we can split the traffic also but a/b test is the best way to actually test it and if you don't have an a/b test instant before and after tests where we use comparable timelines and comparable percentages to make sure that let's say let's say june we've deployed this in may and june and july are equal months for you guys relatively speaking and in june let's say we're doing the integration and june you did 1.5 percent conversion rate in july if it is a comparable month you typically would have done 1.5 also but with unbxd we're able to now a 1.75 conversion.
rep,so you can do it before after tests like that or like i said the best way to do an a/b test split if you do an a/b test where you're not using unbxd you might continue to do 1.5 where are using unbxd you'll do 1.75 or 1.85 or better.
rep,okay but yet the way you mention is if it was just looking at an isolation of time every if you're powering all three product discovery no matter how they come in it will all be capital to unbxd how do you care how do you measure that it is comparing it to a baseline absolutely.
rep,or then or you do an a/b test with. the other piece i wanted to show you real quick was and so to give you an idea of the example of the type of reporting i wanted to give you an idea just kind of quickly a few seconds it's a big report perfect so let's say i want to show you if you can still see my screen let's say i am here something is sample report that we were that we generate let's say i have different categories called girls plus guys etc i know you are all women's clothing but this was just to give you an idea let's say you have different categories of product will actually give you an analysis to identify and say you know what how is each category doing in terms of its funnel you know how many clicks carts orders and conversion that you actually have and it might be at different category levels so you have dresses of the categories and you have maxi dresses as a category then maybe within maxi dresses you might have something else.
rep,so let's say you have cats one cat two cats three levels of categories then we'll give you an analysis that combines different categories so how about if i combined girls in top cat 1 in cat 2 what is that conversion level look like now what if i convert cat 2 and cat 3 what would that look like now what if i combine all the elements with an attribute actually so if i let's say combined all cat levels and now also include a colour as an attribute or size as an attribute how it is that funnel actually doing for me you can start to get an understanding to say you know what look i have plus dresses in black colour doing really well which might be pretty common in apparel but jeans in light blue is actually not doing equally well you know what's my average conversion level is an above average below average will give you a category performance level so this search but we also give you category pages performance levels where we give you an idea of which category is was doing better say the week of april 24th 30th versus the week on the 17th to the 23rd which one has gone down which one is it constant which categories should you be looking at as a priority .
rep,so we also could get these reports generated like on a weekly basis and then sent to like anybody who would be a part of our team who would be handling the merchandising.
prospect,so we don't have to actually pull these reports ourselves.
rep,exactly now these are reports that we custom generate because everybody does business like it differently if everybody wants to maybe look at these numbers differently so we create these custom reports and we generate them and send them to you that that's exactly you don't have to pull them .
prospect,so when you were sorry so going back to the previous the previous page when you were showing what category 1 category 2 and then the numbers of the conversions is that based on then your your recommendation so if somebody lands on girls and then somebody then lands on shorts you're following that customer to kind of determine what's the best product recommendation to generate that higher conversion rate is that what i was bad way.
rep,yep exactly so if you look if you look at the original reporting that we did so let's say either it's a query or category i have here we were using a grocery example but you can see how we were able to track the funnel how many times did somebody go to that category page how many times somebody clicked on that category page what was that click number look like how many add to cars happen from that funnel how many actually ordered from that add to cart both that conversion rate look like and what was that actual revenue in dollars from that category page so we create that one-to-one correlation to actually see how the customer went from top of the funnel to the end of the funnel from start to finish so that you're now able to correlate that so let's say and when we talk about product recommendations mary it's not that we are talking about i want to make sure i'm clear it's not that we're saying somebody comes to maxi dresses and we show like four recommendations at the top this entire page is rre-sorted so right now you have 11 product there is a restoring of these products all 11 of them based on what we seeing is the best performing product that should show up up top.
prospect,right and that's based on so it's based on the just general traffic and it's not current as opposed to like what people looked at based on before.
rep,its both.
prospect,like i'm trying to is it okay so it's based on also similar silhouettes that they might have looked at in a different category and also based on other users traffic.
rep,exactly so let's exactly so let's say if i'm a first-time user on the site i have no history on the site then we use some implicit signals like we're where are they coming from what time of the year are they coming care what time of the day they are coming in what are other users where similar signals what have they done and what other products might be trending in general to combine those data signals to show the best performing product in front of them now if i start interacting as that individual i start interacting with the results batch so if i look at this results and i say you know what i want to look at i mean you only have 11 products on here so they can just quickly look at them but if i wanted to just look at a colour if i use filters on colours are useful for some price maybe i sort based on something every single click that you do starts to build a user persona for us and we start then using that persona to make sure that no matter where they go on the site we start showing products pay for that.
rep,so if i actually set things now i go in and say if i look at dresses and i might look at maxi dresses now we're going an evening out i might actually show you pink images of those versus if they're available instead of these are the primary images that are available right and so we've changed and it's not dramatic like that it's subtle subtle hints in-between and stuff like that maybe if i look at a certain size and for that size if let's say these two products are not available in that size anymore but these two products do have that size these two products will start to show up up top instead of the other two because you want to make sure that the right size products are that are in inventory are actually available to the customer to choose to see those so.
rep,so that product assortment changes based on what the customer actually has been so more interaction they do so more one-to-one personalization except if they are not interacting it would go and fall back on to more of the collaborative or the general crowd behaviour and use it that way.
rep,okay so that's a category pages right so now you obviously have your personalised recommendations which is the widget strategy right so you might have these recommendations for these recommendations here etc all of these are coming in as different algorithms i might want to show other similar products or other viewed also viewed and bought also bought right the different types of personalization widgets that might be available for that customer.
rep,so two different two different ways in terms of the customer interaction if uses some tailor algorithm to try to show certain products but it does have a different way in terms of how its assesses and can interact with the site .
rep,was i able to answer the question i hope .
prospect,yeah above and beyond.
rep,yeah absolutely so that is why we believe i know that the conversation became in the past was just focused on search and i think that you know just search because it's such a small traffic alone is not naturally going to be the only product we would recommend we would one to recommend all three products for the same price that you're paying today so you're getting more for what you're paying today and all the merchandising controls that you get on top of it for all your marketing activity that you do you can create landing pages you can control your category pages a lot of other elements and on top of that data-driven decision-making where you actually get the analysis back so you can actually see what's working what's not working.
prospect,okay yeah i mean this all makes sense i think we would definitely be interested in the test just to kind of we've i'm fairly new to the company but from my understanding they've only utilised search spring they've never gone with any other different provider so i think it's just for just for the personalization and for the the three different products i think it would be more testing.
prospect,it would just be a matter of understanding like what kind of integration would be required .
prospect,you know it's an easy one for just one second i'm so sorry .
prospect,i'm so sorry i'm supposed to be another meeting right now.
rep,um sorry.
prospect,no it's okay um so yeah i mean i definitely think it's something that would be worthwhile testing just because this company has never gone with a different provider and i think the kind of personalization and especially within the category pages would be really intriguing because as we're looking with our current product recommendation for our product recommendation vendor they're looking at specifically product recommendations on the category pages as opposed to the personalization that you're talking about so .
prospect,of i think just that kind of insight would definitely be worth testing so what kind of implementation would be required is it a simple api where you're pulling our inventory and what kind of coding and script would we need to lay on our site .
rep,correct so you guys are niva you have a niva plug-in i don't know if you worked with alex from viking coders that niva but they are the ones we work with where we built a plugin so the plugin pushes the catalog to us catalog feed and then depending on how you want to show the search results the category pages is set up we just hook into it from the back end where you're able to now render those results the calling unbxd and either using ajax or otherwise and for recommendations it's definitely an ajax strategy where it's a it's a widget a div tag that you just put on the other site and that's it so it's a pretty straightforward fully six weeks roughly the time it takes depending on how much customisation you want us to do also obviously but we work with a lot of similar customers like fashionable panes cables dot com etc and so integration is straightforward because of the plugin.
prospect,mm-hmm okay and you say it's approximately four to six weeks just depending on the customization that would be required .
rep,correct yes a couple of two to three weeks worth of development depending on amount of back end force that we need to do sometimes you're more back and forth then it takes a little bit longer but one or two weeks of testing and i'm sure there's going to be some sort of a deployment processes that you guys follow whatever that takes a week to deploy or not so that's like about four to six weeks so that's all.
prospect,hmm okay great perfect um well your timing is actually perfect because i'm actually supposed to go into a marketing meeting right after this call so .
prospect,so we're gonna discuss is that we're gonna discuss this internally like i said i definitely will be putting two at least do the toss especially since your pricing structure is along the lines of of what we're currently paying.
prospect,so but you know just to understand so in the event that after the 60 or 90 day test if we aren't seeing that uptick it would just be $1200 for the three services still is that correct.
rep,that is correct
prospect,all right that's interesting that's good to know.
rep,yeah based on what your traffic is mary and if you're not able to do five percent better i think we should find some other business to be in to be honestly with you.
prospect,i agree completely yeah.
rep,and so so i feel pretty confident and which is why i said rightly put warehouses and the idea behind that is every poc that we've done we've been able to grow at least 15-20 percent if not 30 percent in some instances so we know we are going to go after the full monty of the four thousand that we want to earn but we also want to make sure that we prove this to you and we align ourselves if you don't do it you don't get it if you prove it we get it and so be prepared that it's not gonna be two thousand or twelve hundred we're gonna do everything in our power to earn the four thousand all we are asking is just give us an opportunity the only other case i wanted to also throw this out there because you're going to the media i won't keep you too long either is just there's a small fee for the poc we used to do three pieces by the way long time ago but we learned the lesson the hard way a lot of times you might have multiple projects that you do and if you has a free one we will never get the time of the day or the priority so we do ask for small fee there's a setup fee and end the use of 60 days or 90 days of whatever time frame that you use we would combine bundle everything into one fee which would come around something say five thousand to six seven thousand dollars one time depending on again of what customisation you asked us to do if there's nothing we wouldn't be close to the 5k if it is a lot of customisation it may be seven or more depending on what that is and and that's it. so there's a set up fee one time which also covers the poc timeframe if you continue to if you perform you pay us be the 4k number if you don't perform pay us the 1200 or the 2k or whatever that in between numbers out to fee.
prospect,so i'm just showing clear during the test are we also paying the monthly fee.
rep,no you're not you're only paying that one fees or five k or seven k one time and that includes our work to do the implementation or and it also covers two months worth of the poc where we're serving life traffic.
prospect,mm-hmm okay perfect all right well i'm so sorry i do have to get going um.
prospect,thank you so much for your very first mm-hmm.
rep,absolutely i'll let me go last question what is a good time for us to hold off and start bothering you again.
prospect,i would say probably the first week of june as of right now we're pretty much locked in as of right now we're pretty much locked in and in terms of a bunch of new initiatives that we're trying to implement for this month to launch in that first week of june so right after i would say like the first or second week of june would be a good time frame because we would have had all the programs that we're currently working on fully rolled out and can actually spend a little bit more time digging into this.
rep,for so technical usual start bothering you again .
prospect,that sounds great thank you so much.
rep,like every hours
prospect,have a good day.
rep,you too. thank you so much for the opportunity again we'll talk again soon.
rep,so one of the key things we do is most of the search vendors are partners you might have spoken with always talked about the availability sla and the response time sla like 300 milliseconds for three nines to five nines availability we offer all that along with that we also understand search as a product or product discovery association is so intrinsic to every retailer that what might work for say a us might not work for you.
rep,so what we've done is we within a very using poc module that you could become an improvement solution in for five weeks and then you can actually use the solution for a month after we implemented it and in that thirty to sixty days we guarantee you a 10% uptick in conversion so that you know what you're buying before you're committed into a contract and that is something that was a part of our contractual process also so that every customer who contracts with us gets to see the value of the product before they do that .
rep,and we've done this with every retailer like with express one of the key comments that the ceo made in the earnings for last year was in this poc we actually grew all our conversions by over twenty seven percent and it's not just expressed we've done it with retailer in every space it could be ashley it's best we would when you want it could be iv supply the new egg it could be pot pourri across different platforms across different verticals to consistent things you would see during the poc is one is with the improvement in product discovery space and the user experience itself you conversion rate in peace as well as at responding that means any questions on this so far .
rep,no i mean the majority of the of your your client what's their previous platform is it something old something new is it a combination .
rep,we have a in the b2b part space we have a lot of customers who are using solar like an iv supply with a classic solar home loan custom platform implementation and then they move to unbxd.
rep,in the apparel space we primarily see a lot of atg and endeca implementations but yeah it's it's it's fairly diverse but but i would say about 65 70 percent were using the different search vendor and about 30 35 percent were actually building it in solar that's the broad geography classification.
rep,right so now what i want to do is go through all those specific use cases on your site and and have gone through all the specific use cases sites starting from the first experience which is your search box like what do people say to them they start typing but trying to find a product on the search box then look at the error tolerance and the site then look at the actual code relevancy it's just probably the most critical thing then have taken some examples on the ui you could probably look at doing differently and then we can talk about much in it so this is essentially what we wanted to discuss with you on the call and.
rep,so to get started in terms of auto suggest this is the current experience in the auto suggest it is visual to some extent because also better to some extent it is nice to see but what i wanted to also show you was some of the auto suggest experience this we have built and customised for every retailer because we believe that this is the first experience so your users are getting on the site and it has to be something very specific to and playing to your strengths so that you leave that first great impression and i will show you some live examples so that you could actually get some context on what i'm actually talking about.
rep,can you guys see the screen of mine parts warehouse.
rep,so with parts warehouse before they came on to unbxd essentially had two different search boxes the reason was because they had two kinds of customers one customer who would come and search by a park number and another customer would come and search by a model name right so that's what having two search boxes will help him better the product discovery experience but again managing to a difference of experience is screwed up revenue significantly so in came on board with two things one was we built them a part find out where essentially you can go and find any part in three clicks and then from a search experience we unified that experience so today if you say pick up the first one here start typing in they sell the wave you've configured the search boxes on one side you see parts the other side you see model names and then you have all the top searches based on where they're coming from right something that we built custom built for them and the way we've also configured the pages you click on that specific model number it essentially takes you to a page which displays all the parts available and then you can go and look for every part right here as the specific experiences they wanted to create for their customer and then if you go into an apparel space and i just give you examples probably one in a very vertical so that you get some context on the customisation we've done.
rep,pure for them segmentation become very critical because they're sending a specific style every geo has a specific design something some specific dress type that there's more popular colour that is more popular so the way we built an experience for them is you start typing in jeans the wave you have built a segmentation logic is okay jeans could be for men it could be for women it could be on a specific style and then based on the geo it could be of a specific colour this is more popular than that from the rest course blue could be more popular midwest gray might be more popular and the west in east and then what are the top queries and we've kept a whole box or to suggest where essentially me just change as you move along okay.
rep,so that was an experience we've built for express and then if you go into the cross city space where the behaviour is more about people buying multiple products in a single transaction we work with fresh director of new york we were this company could be busted out of southeast asia you know the largest in that space know roughly what three anout well you know that's non individual for them the use case was people by about twenty six products in a single transaction so they want to make sure that people add products to pack in the fastest possible manner the pitch buying twenty six products would mean pretty good pdp pages picks and they wanted to avoid that so the way we've been for them is safe chicken is a part of your my grocery run the woman you start typing in chicken you have an option to change quantity and add products the cart right from the search box depending on the city you're coming in there is a banner specific to that city with an offer district for that city and then you have commonly searched terms a popular brands and your categories and.
rep,then we also personalised it took a step further if i'm a person who buys chicken with skin chicken wit skin shows up to me on top if you are a person who buys chicken without skin chicken without skin shows up top so depending on new user versus repeat user those options can also be person x any questions on this so far.
prospect,not much you can use the add to cart button in search box they type.
rep,yes you can use add to cart right here.
prospect,this<>.
rep,yeah they actually have found this extremely useful.
prospect,and then in terms of what's rendered being more personalised is that a rule set on the back end or that auto-generated based on the intelligence of your tool.
rep,it can be both as there's a machine learning platform so it is auto-generated but we also have a merchandising dashboard will also take you to where you can also set any specific rules if you want it works both case.
prospect,okay and those rules are set globally right or with triggers or something like that .
rep,yes you can a set rules more globally you can set rules for every category and and yeah and you can trigger rules or in base of a specific event you have all those options available for you to do that.
rep,okay and for them a big basket i think the demography is about 67% of their users you search so this works really well for them because most of the people are actually coming onto this use case and they're actually using this specific add to cart functionality and especially for items that you buy every time i think things like milking chicken and bread you don't have to go and see the product specifically there's a small image of the product anyways available and your quantity and you can change them and and them cart instead of going through specific pdp pages versus there is something very specific you want to buy or explore buying you can still go into the search page or the pdp page and explore bottom so works both ways for them but this specific functionality has made a huge difference and update conversions basically.
rep,right these are just use cases i was showed about bounce off so that you get some context with the level of customisation we actually get every retailer x all these products it could be the ones this in express anything happens on the fly and and it's fairly intelligent that way we're safer expensive you want to just look at say dress right on the inventory they don't have dress for men right so you don't see that option for men at all so it is very it specifically pulls up and presents this entire layout for a specific user and it happens dynamic plates it's not temperature driven that way any questions.
rep,right so so this was an auto search right the second section i went through was on the edit other it it said where are we drop a single letter or spell a specific word and and see how the error tolerance were i would generally say spwll checks have have like i've tried a bunch of combinations on the site in most cases it does work pretty well i'm not sure if the approach today is to build a list of synonyms are back in i'm not sure how you're doing it or even great a specific algorithm to auto correct them on the fly is there a specific use case of how you how you've done it today.
prospect,there is an intelligent from back end lot of it.
rep,okay that's that's good to know and and i've tried dropping a single letter or misspelling a single letter right tried misspelling the word gloves it's not that <> results was much smaller than what we actually have in terms of the products available in the gloves product right and then miss spelled the word disposable aspirator or milwaukee backpack right i miss spelling one letter two letters essentially it does not show me the right set of products.
rep,and the way we've done is is primarily based on the intel machine learning logic we've done two things one is we've made the machine learning system contextually aware into the retails space itself and we've also gone a step further of sensitising the machine learning algorithm for every vertical so this has been a machine learning algorithm has been trained across five million words commonly used in the e-commerce context and then there is vertical specifically learning that the machine learning platform itself and now the platform's over six years mature so it improves every single day.
rep,so we've tried to train it to an extent where even if you spare misspelled three words incorrectly in a single search phase more than 99% of the cases are auto correct itself.
rep,and the way we've built our entire error correction library is forward stemmed words as well as spelling mistakes more than 96 percent overall you don't have to go and create anything more unless there's some very specific jargon you want to create we have the option of the dashboard to go and create a sedative both of uni-direction and in the bi-direction you've done a few things if you like look this is for iv supply misspelled the word analyser i will spell the word filter it automatically corrects itself and if you want to go for more than one word so if you go to say an express and we spell the word black leather jacket and all the three words misspelled essentially what the system is doing at the back and it understands jacket is a product like there is a fabric attribute black is a colour attribute it not only auto correct itself but also starts displaying preserves from the word though.
rep,same thing works for stemming the intent here is the customer intent is not changing just because he is typing the specific word in a specific way like bathroom fans bath space room fans bathroom fan there's some inconsistencies in the number of results shown one thing we've tried doing this since the intent of the user is not changing make sure that if there is variations of that word display consistent results like t-shirt when you spell in four different ways you see single results in every time.
prospect,<> you do this at the e-commerce level try to create these rules right like how do you how can you do a better job or the mro space or you know that essentially the industry that we're in i mean i don't know that some of this applies because that just is that just learning over time and and tool does its job or is that something that we have to create these rules ourselves.
rep,so generally we've seen it in the pot in this space also we have a decent number of customers now so we have sensitize the algorithm to pick up words how it is spelled in this context but at the same time what we also do is when we start at implementation the first thing we implement is analytics it's a simple probably half an hour job at your end but while we do that implementation for the next four five weeks the system is all clean learning as to how people are keying in and buying products on your site so it's a lot more aware and a couple of things we could also do is if there are already some rules that you've built in more specifically if you've already done you could also import them so that on damen the system is much more relevant to just not to your space but very specific to your brand and and it the whole idea here is how do we avoid you doing anything manually how can everything be automated so it's it's a combination of that sorry for the long answer.
prospect,no i appreciate of course.
rep,that so again this was on edit all of <> and the third thing that we did notice or since this is a sas product right and if you notice like we're hosted on amazon we have present in like three amazon locations across the country and we also have redundancy with the endetailstire infrastructure replicated overseas so that if anything had to happen in the us it's it's available and it's fronted by a cdn so you guarantee sub 300 millisecond response time perspective look where users are across the country i did a quick search speed test from the infrastructure you know this that the search results load load slightly slower compared to what an internet retailer would recommend where it's generally recommended to be under 300 milli seconds and we've done this test on express on black friday cyber monday where traffic is about 15 x normal and this is a part of our sla which you would see in the contract irrespective of wherever you are in the country the pages load within 300 milliseconds so that's another benefit you get with a cloud solution where it's essentially you have a cloud solution and it's fronted by a cdn so people are probably receiving this data nearest to their server right.
rep,now the fourth element probably the most important probably the hardest to solve is the core relevancy and i would not say we're 100% relevant but we are anywhere between 85 to 90 percent relevant compared to most of the other retailers and the primary reason because is the way we've built a platform making it extremely specific to e-commerce and then sensitising the algorithm for every vertical.
rep,another thing that we have done as a foundation of the platform is also tried analyse how people buy products on an e-tail site it could be any tail site broadly there's about 12 ways people look up for information right in a site like yours they might come with an exact product name that they want to buy they probably exactly know what to buy or they might know an exact part number that they might want to come and buy and then if you go into any apparel space they might probably buy by a specific theme to be say cocktail vases or formal trousers right on if they might be going into an appliance store where they're looking for a specific feature right probably related to  <> data and and then if you were one thing you also notice in the last 12 months there's been a huge influx of natural language queries probably they were less than 1% or 2% in most e-commerce sites but we have seen today that especially sometimes in apparel the number is beyond 10% because that's how people are used to buying products on amazon or looking up for information on google so the way we have built a platform is beyond the e-commerce awareness is also building algorithms to resolve for each of these kind of queries out of the box hence the name was actually unbxd.
rep,right so when i'm done try doing the same thing and again the intent here is not to show that your search does not do well just to see where is the opportunity for us to probably come in contribute right and i've taken a bunch of scenarios some of the exact search use cases and feature type and non product and natural language and try to show some deference okay.
rep,one of the things i did was try looking at your top hundred organic and paid keywords and find looking for no specific information like topedo heater parts is one of your top keywords you have the product available but when you search for it you don't find that product then tried looking for again heavy-duty power relays you again have the product available in your category page but when you search for it i'm not sure if it's not available in the inventory or not but when i search for it i did not find that product i so just saw some use cases there where we can come in and improve and we've tried doing that similarly like an exact product or where you for a black logitech wireless keyboard or you for a brighter 169 on spray bottle the intent here is how do you understand what the user is looking for and then in e-commerce context if you're looking for a bright air 169 oz spay bottle how does your algorithm actually search for that product which keyword here gets what weighted and how does it pull product this is what we've figured out pretty well and i can show you through the technology layer as to how we exactly resolve this internally but what we've seen is with more than 90-95% of the cases we actually come out and return the right results okay. the second thing i tried doing was some feature based searches look for a 42-inch red platform cart where i exactly know what i want called even black chemical-resistant glove size eight it is picking up some relevant products which is good to see but there are also a few products where it's probably displaying a long tail where it's doing an anding or an or-ing at a back end and displaying a bunch of products available.
rep,i'll do i did see is for some of the broader based product searches there are probably some rules built in so the relevancy is much higher but as it goes to a long tail the relevancy comes little over i'm not sure if you observe this or i'll find out and we've tried solving it when you go very specific to a specific feature like on in apparel where people can go very specific where they can ask look for say a full sleeve office where for women or a black v-neck for the money the intent is how do you understand the context of what the user is looking for likw how does women rank how does full sleeve right how does office where ranked as tokens and how do you pull up the right product accordingly is what we try doing differently and display the right results any questions so far.
prospect,out of all your clients what's the average number of skus that your clients have or what's the low and high.
rep,so we generally prefer at least having 10000 skus us to show any noticeable difference but on the higher side yeah we have like starting with mid segment retailers like iv supplay who have got half a million skus to bed bath and probably has more than two and a half million skus to a us auto which has close to 100 million skus or new at marketplace's some of 80million so i think the more number of skus is where our product actually becomes more and more relevant because our indexing algorithm and the way we index from index about 5000 products a second so more the skus the better for us when it comes to relavancy you need in fact perform much better than everybody else in this space but especially when the sku counts will larger.
prospect,so you has a new egg the client and they have around 18 million skus.
rep,roughly yeah.
rep,and us auto has more than 100 actually the actual skus set is about two and a half million but if you look at sorry nine million but if you look at the actual skus and the cars available and you do a multiplication essentially more than 120-130 million specific it's the amount of mapping we'll have to that i do add a bucket to dissolve those products appropriately.
prospect,and your performance is at the same level less than 300 millisecond.
rep,that's the sla that we guarantee for every customer and whatever the infrastructure being have to build in it a vacuum is what people.
rep,and just to understand okay how many skus do you have today probably the parent or the variation even if your number you can give us .
prospect,we have between one and one and a half million but that a major initiative within zoro is to add skus at a rapid pace so you know we could have over two million by the end of the year i'm really not sure it's not our responsibility our team but it's growing pretty fast so something we're concerned with.
rep,okay yeah as i told you we've had enough use cases and i think the one good thing that we could do is it's an easy tool to quickly test for you like we can put something up together where you can test it within a two-month window we build it in a month and you test it another month so you can see how a specific relevancy mapping works even before you make a buying decision on the products.
rep,right so the next thing i tried doing is those partial number skus matches right like this is a product was looking for like what if i exclude one letter here like towards the end in between might still show me a different product but what if i just exclude a letter so what i wanted to see was not whether it's showing me the right product or not as to how the experience of finding such products are doesn't show me options i and i get sorry to nitpick on this but these are some of the things that we've tried doing one is again you start typing a product name a in an opposite experience it preempts a lot of those searches you might be trying to do.
rep,and and then at a search relevancy revenue even if you have a partial product number i can we still show you options which you can pick from because this is a broader category and then there are multiple other ids associated after this it's essentially a ten ten to twelve character mapping that iv supply has for its products but we resolve for those partial  sku id researches also pretty well over.
rep,then try doing some non product searches this could be simple redirects to a returns page or a shipping policy page i didn't see the redirects happen today that is something that you could consider adding with us this redirects happen automatically if you know it could be for a specific category or it could be for a specific non product way like a shipping policy contact us or about us.
rep,then try doing some compatibility based searches when i'm looking for bolts for a drywall this is where understanding context becomes more important where i'm not looking for a drive were looking for polls full tripods in an express example we tops for jeans not the jeans i might be looking for tops how do we resolve for that and then finally looking at some natural language queries my i did notice it's it's pretty few but these were one of the few i found in your top 25 how do you determine the chucks size key this was google ranking the position and volume obviously don't find it one of the things we've tried doing this to be at least 80 to 90 percent relevant natural language.
rep,this is probably where we as a company have to do still the most amount of work because we have a lot of customers in the apparel space where natural language is used quite a lot and we've tried our best to be 80 to 90 percent relevant like something like a new dress on sale how do you pull up products the most .
rep,so yeah that was a high-level review okay and not to point out something is working or not working but just wonder like identify for myself as to what would be the opportunity in what your customers be seeing to the other site any questions overall kyle the steam walls.
prospect,no i mean i think it's good i think a lot of the stuff you've identified we're aware of and we're trying to you know slowly knock it out or get it get it fixed but it's nice to know that your tool in some way you know automates these types of things so and .
rep,and again there's no 100% solution on the relevancy tile but what we're trying to do is try and be as close as possible at the same time automate as much as we can at the same time give you ability to do things finally as well and and i think what we enjoy more as a company is the more challenge the catalogue becomes the more larger the catalogue becomes we really start doing very and the difference we can bring to the table is much higher with somebody who has more skus rather than somebody has small skus.
rep,so that's where we believe you could have then wanted to give you some quick ui structures that we have built for retailers and again this we refer as head queries but mobile here in this sense could mean a mobile phone it in a mobile headphone remove the casing cover or a mobile bluetooth one of the ways we've tried solving it create a horizontal vertical mapping with horizontally so the scope of all the categories and vertically display products was the most popular category and we've tried making this dynamic where say after 15 days we you can we can trigger those timers and you have the ability to customise them where if we believe mobile kits of all populated mobile phones then cases appear ahead of mobile phones so that is something that happens automatically and this sari is in the e-commerce in the apparel context like what we're trying to show here is alexander wang it is a designer but this designer sells dresses to shoes to shoulder bags how do you show it for a usable form for an optimal product discovery experience you have again created a horizontal vertical mapping where we vertically in vertically we display all the different sub verticals and horizontal scroll actually takes you to all the products.
rep,some of the ui customisation we could we could do to make sure that your product discovery experience is lot.
rep,we still have to create the template depending on what kind of customisation you want but the way it picks up the products in this place they will that those are dynamic but the layout is something that will have to still build out one second and the end if you already have a layout because similar layout and then basically populate these automatically that something that we can also.
rep,and the other use case which probably becomes more and more relevant in your context like especially we've seen people and iv supply which is about half a million skus and they have about six thousand filters that they use how do you make filter is more useful in product discovery experience.
rep,the one thing we've tried doing this create dynamic filter faceting so we're a for every product or a category we allow you to define facets say for casual shoes you can define all the facets relevant to casual shoes and then the user can come and look for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes you not have the word shoes it it would be mens nike vs adidas the results will appear in the same order of attribution and then it's dynamic where if we figure that good is a more click filter than size then width automatically moves up on top right and the similar use case could be on shirts where you define specific attributes or shirts you can search for casual shirts formal shirts t-shirts and it will appear in the same order and then if we figure out that probably a sleeve or a fit is more popular than size and they automatically show up on top.
rep,then finally how do you personalise zero results again i do see some good matches here you show some top sellers when it when you land up in a zero is our page some of the things we've tried doing is also segmenting it for a new user versus a repeat user intent here is give more call to action for user to do when he or she lands upon on a land page like this and we can customise it for a new user what products do you show for a returning user what products you can show and how what kind of widgets you can actually display on a search page.
rep,and this is something that we could also do any questions so far there this was like a quick high-level site overview such.
prospect,no look good .
rep,thank you kayl that and then if you want to just do a quick deep lavender how we actually do it this is essentially from a technology standpoint how we resolve it at our back end we do five things for every query start with semantic relevance which is the entire contextual awareness then we do something called the search results exclusion then we add the machine learning on top of it then we let then we look for any merchandising rule set and then we do any specific personalization or segmenting targeting that we need to do and this is something that we do for every single query and the reason we do this today is if you look at this query right i'm sorry it's a parallel context women white jeans most search systems are including so that they essentially use tf-idf where essentially they're looking for some kind of a text pattern match it could be in terms of anding or it could be a in terms of coughing or it could be in terms of minimum match in each of these three use cases what you would end up seeing is either two little products or way too many products or a whole group of irrelevant products which is not aware from a contextual sense because in the e-commerce context in especially in a apparel jeans probably is the most popular product and then it's women and probably then it's white right.
rep,but if you look at how the idea of ranking works or the tf-idf is just basically the term frequency inverse document frequency this is how the scores up here right and that's why you find deserve and products when you have it by this technique right and the reason is because they only give you some values a popularity score a verity score there is no usefulness or the context of the in commerce actually being available and that is something that we add which we call it as a relevance game where for the same use cases women white and jeans we understand that jeans is the most popular product in the e-commerce context then it's women then it's jeans so we are actually adding something call us relevance game to be already available published idea of course and hence the essentially display products for in at stage one we push products which are not relevant towards the bottom and then we finally do exclusions of taking them away right.
rep,and replace it with a more element product after this is where our machine learning comes in where since we have our analytics installed we are constantly reviewing all the click stream data to get to get more get more of a vector smoke-off there among these four products which should be displayed on the top and this is the amount of data that becomes you like for large retailers for somebody at the scale of express we can zoom anywhere between 20 to 25 gb of machine learning data every single day which is passed back to our system and then we identify which is the most popular among these four products it has to be displayed for this specific user and in the end of displaying them and another important thing is even in merchandising when you boost a specific set of product in most traditional system it's essentially un-normalised if you boost the specific product it applies across all categories what we have done is we have made sure that whenever you do boosting for the specific product it happens within that category so that there is no un-normalisation and then finally we also let you and.
rep,this is just a quick snapshot of had some in <> in solar like this is essentially how solar is and what we have done is.
rep,our underlying platform is still you seen be essentially hacked into the scene and then built all these elements around it to build a completely machine learning enabled system this for you too and i can share this document review that just or i'll give you a quick tour of how the back end technology works any questions on this so far.
rep,i know its 45 minutes but i'll give you a quick tour of how a merchandising tool works we just add a new dashboard to lase i'm just trying to let out for you so now i think the interest of time i'll show you older dashboard in the older dashboard but essentially at a high level if you have multiple subdomains or multiple environments like a stating production testing you can essentially manage all your environments in a single window all unbxd related documentation is available here and you can give specific user access permissions to every individual you can send us the catalogue in any format it could be a song xml csv or in this dump it on a ftp location we can pick it up or we can do a real-time api call to actually pick up the product and do any dynamic indexing that's quite the thumb rule we do a full catalogue update once a day or a differential update every 30 minutes but again we can tweak the frequency how you want to tweak it on an average if you have say even 5000 products changing or 10000 products changing it will be done overall process will be done in less than a minute so that way it shouldn't be a problem .
rep,depending on your catalogue data all the fields are displayed you can make make any field for either auto suggest or search searchable or non searchable this is a hinge anywhere all your facets are displayed you can go and add any new facet or edit an existing facet and map it to a specific attribute then on synonyms again just to repeat myself you don't have to add synonyms it will all be done automatically but if there are some very specific jargon which you know was very very specifically applies to your industry we also give you an option to come and add a synonym and create the uni-direction or the bi-irection equivalent from merchandising perspective you can merchandise your search you can merchandise for all your category pages as well.
rep,fairly simple to create rules for search you can just create a rule in the new dashboard when you click on merchandise for a specific rule you can all you also have time stamps where you can say if the campaign starts on so and so date ends in so and so date you can also segment it for which device you want to show this campaign is this mobile only or is it mobile and desktop only or is a mobile desktop and laptop as well and tablet as well and then you can also do segmentation this is available for <> this is available for new york all that segmentation actually do on the new - so that's what i wanted to pull up i'll share this with you you can also play around with it right and then for any query fairly simple to merchandise when you click on merchandise broadly you can do three things you can do filter by a specific attribute you can run promotions or you can create a custom landing page of a banner like we've created a demo login for apparel like i just want to show you that they dress if this is a query you wanna merchandise and if this is the order the same thing appears at our back in here if you want to run a promotion say you can sort them boost them and slot them you can either use in leaver or you can choose to do it by some random attribute
rep,you can say title contains élisa élisa product show up in the top this is more intuitive in the new dashboard unfortunately couldn't log into that and then you can drag drop it in pin product to a specific location any number you want or you can do a simple slotting where you can slot them and say positions three two positions for say a brand contains wealth and then you can create specific we didn't say that positions one and to show my top sellers three and four show me my highest margin five and six push two products out of the inventory which i want to you said some specific rules like that then once you create and publish essentially you come back and click on dress again these are the two products your pinned and these are the two <> products you've slaughtered .automatically comes up on the site okay.
rep,and then similarly you can create a custom landing page create a html create an image banner and create products that you want your users to see as well.
rep,similarly you can do it for a specific category as well you can go create a custom landing page for a category and you can also reorder facets for every category say for say in this case nikkers probably price could be the most important filter then it could be say size then it could be say colour you can reorder them and save changes and then after the few days based on the click stream data if say colour is a more click filter than price and colour automatically moves up on top.
rep,and then in terms of reporting with a high level to taper slightly for sample and a high level we give you all the top searches to top products article card the car top clicked and top 0 results and you can then drill down but every single query and every category as well where you have reporting for say if you want to do a query level drill down you can go to a query called dress see how is this query performing all the products associated to that query so demo dashboard might not see more this <> and then how is this specific query converting is like so you can do all of that and you can do it similarly for every product as well.
rep,so that way it gives you a very specific drill down because if you are using ga today i'm not sure you use the ga today or you use amateur.
prospect,ga.
rep,in  ga one of the challenges we've seen is safe have come and searched for a specific product i don't find the right results then i go through a browse and navigate through the site and buy a specific product what ga will report is that this search the session resulted in a conversion which is true but not exactly accurate.
rep,so what we do is we trigger based on a specific event if somebody actually searches for it then eventually buys it is only when we add it to search is only when we add it as a search converts that way it's more an accurate way of demonstrating how you search is actually do it in the site. any questions on this.
prospect,no i think we're who's teen no yeah i think we're we're here in some background noise yeah i know i think it's good okay if you go use yourself hey guys and get yourself level i think it seems good level i think.
rep,<> i'm sorry there's every time i talk it repeating me. alright i think it's fine now alright we're really just exploring different options right now we have a long term contract in place but it's nice to see you know your capabilities and the tool so we appreciate that i think if you could share this with it with us we can review internally and then try to figure out what our next steps are
prospect,we honestly aren't in a position to replace our current search platform but we're always you know looking for different opportunities and considerations so it's something that you know will review and and let you know our thoughts on.
rep,absolutely i'm definitely a forward this to you and i'm not sure if the the current search contract you have ends here or is it something that extends to the next year as well i'm not sure but if there is any opportunity for us to come and do a poc we can also happy to do an a/b test against an existing search platform to see how we could add value to zero tools we would love that opportunity you could let us know and then we can take next steps on that .
prospect,okay yeah sounds great we appreciate the time thanks for putting this together and we'll look forward to seeing it and our inboxes and then we'll we'll establish next steps from there.
rep,no problem is that a specific timeline you want me to follow up say in two weeks three weeks .
rep,no problem and look this one last edition that in a test we sometimes do a non-inclusive test which we called us in page ajaxt essentially you give us your header and footer ntdf tagging we do the head html induction so in this way we're not doing api base we know don't consume your engineering sources most of the development work is actually done at our end and then once we put it together we can even run a three-month test well for for an extended period of time we can do an a/b test versus an existing platform so that you could see if we're actually doing much significant higher conversion number which could probably prompt you to take a decision moving as well so we could make that feasible but again i leave it to you i understand in stringent timelines but i told i just want to let you know that this is an option available.
prospect,okay we will do we really appreciate the time have a good day.
rep,have a segment in target tools well for both segmentation and list one to one personalization so that that's the whole gamut we cover. however this presentation have primarily prepared for site search most of the machine learning elements would remain the same and apply across all our products. and i'm happy to spend time and talk about the other products as well just thought i'll give you a context.
rep,does that work for you both.
rep,okay so this was a quick high-level agenda i had prepared for today i want to spend a minute or two just to talk about who we are and what we do then what i've done is have done a quick site search audit for digi-key today.
rep,and have tried drawing some parallels with similar customers that we work so that you get an apples to apples comparison.
rep,and then we can spock's talk specifics about the technology behind it the other features on the product or some of the other verticals that we cater to as well. so that was high level agenda so it should essentially take me about 45-50 minutes to go through the entire deck but feel free to stop me if you have any questions.
rep,okay before we get started i just had two quick questions wanted to know which e-commerce platform you're on today and do you use anybody for site search or is it more built in solr.
prospect,we have homegrown solutions today.
rep,okay both are homegrown okay good to know.
rep,great so this is who we are as i told you we're in the bay area headquartered in mountain view we also have an office in chicago and then an international operations in bangalore.
rep,seven-year-old company work with about 120 retail brands power about 1200 global sites have success in every vertical.
rep,we work with express rue21 just started working with ann taylor & loft hsn in the fashion and the marketplaces work with ib supply a b2b manufacturer out of milwaukee we work with us auto parts warehouse freund container in the parts and hardware space.
rep,we work with hh gregg in electronics fresh direct in pharmacy ashley bed bath in home improvement.
rep,so this kind of demonstrated our solution works pretty well irrespective of whichever vertical that we deal with retail.
rep,and the solution is completely platform agnostic it could be a homegrown platform like you have today or even if you have to move to an enterprise platform it could be atg or websphere or hybris even later the solution will have no impact.
rep,we will not get impacted by just changing the platform so this is typically who we are any questions on this so far.
rep,great so one of the key roles that i play in the company is a i talk to a lot of retailers like yourself and i also work very closely with my product team so that we're building the right set of feature set for all our product suite.
rep,and for us solr search has always been our core component because probably 24 months ago a lot of retailers had probably between ten and twenty percent of their overall traffic on site search but today some of some of the retailers we work with have close to 50% or 60% of the traffic on search.
rep,and what we've traditionally observed is site search as a component is generally the conversion rates are sometimes 2x or even 3x your normal site search site conversions.
rep,so search essentially contributes a 50% of your business in most cases so search is an extremely critical component for every retailer today and our solution and our core relevancy strength primarily differentiates us from everybody else out there.
rep,we are a sas platform but we do guarantee five nines of availability we have fronted by a cdn and we guarantee a sub 300 millisecond response time irrespective of where your user is across the country.
rep,and the one differentiator which we have is because we understand especially on product discovery the needs are so different for every retailer because we might have worked with us auto parts but what we've built for them might not be relevant to you.
rep,because your businesses could be very unique and the behavior of your customers could also be very unique so we have a poc model where we could come in and implement the solution in the in four to six weeks and then we let you use the product for the remaining six weeks.
rep,so that you see actually how the search performs for you and we guarantee you are ten percent lift in conversions within the first 90 days.
rep,you see that lift in conversions you see that business impact you like working with our team and then you could continue with us for a contract or if you don't see the impact you can walk away no questions asked.
rep,so this way you get to test the product before you actually buy it.
rep,does that sound fair.
prospect,that sounds fair.
rep,and the confidence primarily where it comes from stacy david is because we've seen the success across every vertical and every retailer we've worked with.
rep,we've seen numbers as high as 50 60 % lift if the search was very very bad or even on cases where people have worked immensely on search especially solr instances we are still been able to demonstrate a fairly significant impact.
rep,like what i could do is after this presentation i would also send you a case study that we prepared recently with ib supply they roughly do over a hundred million dollars online based out of milwaukee and some of their ambassador something that you could talk to refer to we would be happy to organize a call as to how we made a difference to them.
rep,so this is this is the approach that we take towards implementation right so now let me get into some of these use cases and when i worked on these use cases i've tried to mimic your customers behavior in terms of how do he or she actually finds products on your site what is the current experience today and what is that we could do differently.
rep,so that i could present an opportunity snapshot for you okay and i start with autosuggest which is your first interaction with your search system for any of the customers.
rep,generally we want the autosuggest to be guided it should be visual it should try and mimic the experience a person might have going into a store if you had a physical store when they go in initially they want to go to a specific <tile> and then they want to look at specific options they want to see products which are visual so it's better so what we try to create with some of our templates.
rep,so today when i look at digikey dot com i do not see an autosuggest option right that is something that i thought was an opportunity for us to look at.
rep,and i'll take you through some of these live sites so that you get some perspective on what we have built for some of our customers and i'll try and stick to closer to your vertical at the same time i'll show you some of the options we've built for other verticals as well so that you get a depth of the customizations we could bring in right.
rep,this is one customer parts warehouse again midwest based roughly about 30 million dollars in online business they had a two specific behavior instances with their customers one was a customer who exactly know which part number to buy and another customer was somebody who did not know the part number to buy.
rep,so before they came on to us they are been with us for the last two years now two and a half years i guess so they had two search boxes.
rep,one search box to find a part number and one search box for a model number search but managing two search instances became complicated.
rep,the relevancy got skewed so what we did is a we built them a part finder where you can essentially find any part in three clicks and from a search experience what we did is today if i pick up the first name here bissell i start looking for bissell one side you would see parts one side you would see model names and then you see top searches for that specific query.
rep,this was one of the instances we did.
rep,now if you move to an auto manufacturer these guys sell a lot of auto parts based on connecticut and for them if i start looking for say a mirror the way they have built an autosuggest experience is they want to first identify which brand that you want a mirror for and then as you hover around we essentially have products available and you can actually add products to cart right from the search box.
rep,so that's another experience we've built for this retailer and if you go to a different vertical say grocery thought the reason i thought i'd show this to you is because you might also have instances where people might not come to your site just to buy one product they might buy more than one product and in grocery that is a classic use case people generally buy 30-40 products in a single transaction.
rep,so to buy a large number of products you end up doing a lot of clicks a they wanted a quick add to cart option like the auto manufacturer you saw and this is a large retailer they do about two million dollars in online revenue they're the largest in southeast asia.
rep,and for them if i start looking for chicken the way we've built the autosuggest experience for them is essentially you can change products quantity and add products to cart right from the search box we also personalize it where depending on your zip code you can actually show an offer for that zip code and then you can also see all the commonly searched terms your popular brands and categories.
prospect,no not from me.
rep,great right and in apparel we can actually up the level of personalization here for somebody like in express the way we've built an experience for them if i start looking for jeans as a product we have a a guided navigation of jeans for women jeans for men and as you hover around images change and then we can also have a segmentation block where depending on the location that you're coming from whichever is the most popular color in that location we can also have different styles in that color and then the top keyword suspect.
rep,so it's more visual and guided for the customer so these are some of the experiences we've built for some of the customers we work with.
rep,okay so the next experience i wanted to talk about was your ability to do error corrections in most instances especially if you've done something on solr or elastic search what you essentially end up doing is try and create a list of synonyms for most of your misspelled words or your stemmed words it could be even simple things like singular and plural.
rep,it works if you have a hundred products or a thousand products to sell but when you sku count becomes fairly large then it becomes a challenge right.
rep,one of the things we have done is essentially a it's our machine learning platform the way we of built a machine learning platform is we've actually trained the platform over 200 million products in the e-commerce space so that it understands the context of what people are looking for and then we have trained it on every vertical.
rep,so the the machine learning platform knows that when somebody looks for a black leather jacket in an apparel space or an 18-ounce 2% nonfat milk in a grocery space what does the exact context of the search means and it's been trained to autocorrect itself up to six words misspelled in a single query.
rep,like i just dropped a single letter or change a single letter for a resistor or a capacitor essentially none of the products showed up right you could like this was something that we built for ib supply you misspell nebulizer you misspell filter a it will autocorrect and it'll also show you result from the word go and then similarly with express you could butcher all the three words black leather jacket as i misspelled it right here it'll autocorrect itself to black leather jacket and show you products.
rep,and again you don't have to do this manually the system does it automatically for more than 99% of the cases all of this is solved out of box any questions on this.
prospect,i don't know david you have questions on that one.
prospect,i mean it looks like in interesting auto-completion system have you done this with highly technical products like ours which you where there's you know a lot of part numbers and things like that.
rep,yeah actually david if you look at us auto us auto actually has two point four million parent products parents skus and they have a lot of variations to it so the overall products sku count that we're looking at with all the variances comes to about 180 million.
rep,so we've managed to scale to that kind of volume and we have a lot of smaller sized retailers as well like the ib supply ib supply has about 450000 skus bed bath has about 6000 skus though it's not technical but ib supply some of the products can get a little technical and then there's <wide container> some of these are fairly technical instances and same with ss396 they also have a million parts that we deal with.
rep,and and today i'm not sure if you are using elastic search or solr is it is it manually updated for all these synonyms and spell checks.
prospect,sorry what's that.
rep,no no today is the experience that you try to build like essentially for any spelling mistake do you do this manually do you input all the variations manually.
prospect,do we do this manually you are asking.
prospect,we don't have any kind of auto-complete do we have stacy.
rep,no no not for auto-complete for spell checks david like in this example if i mis-spelled the world register so essentially unless you've built something manually there's no way to autocorrect itself is that correct.
prospect,stacy do we do anything for autocorrect or spellings.
prospect,no no i don't think we do.
rep,okay sorry the intent was not to put you in a spot it's fine if you don't know and another thing i wanted to talk about stacy david was even the stemmed words right things like an accessories versus accessory the results shown is completely different.
rep,because if but if you look at it as a user my intent is not changing this was just one simple example i pulled up but the intent here is i could spell any way i want like it could be a similar word or a plural word or things like wood wooden center central essentially the user intent is not changing.
rep,so the experience that you show should also not change like i've tried using some snapshots like this was an apparel example but like t-shirt can be spelt in so many different ways but the user intent is not changing so the results that we show should also not change so this is again something that we automate and you don't have to do anything manually on this.
rep,that's another snapshot i wanted to show and the third thing was primarily from an infrastructure standpoint again as i told you since we are fronted by a cdn we guarantee you a sub 300 millisecond response time i did a quick speed test on digi-key today.
rep,i just wanted to search for a capacitor generally it takes about five to six seconds for that search results page to load that is something that we could help you with because a sas platform and b we are fronted by a cdn.
rep,and we've done this test for all our customers even on a black friday it will load up within 300 milliseconds irrespective of where your user is across the country.
rep,this is another benefit which you get with the cloud solution.
rep,and lastly it's about relevancy again as with relevancy the core logic has been being we building up this machine learning platform and making it contextually aware to the entire e-commerce landscape and then another thing that we've tried doing is also identify how people find products online today there are broadly about 12 ways people look for information.
rep,in a site like yours people might be coming by an exact law and searching for an exact product name or a part number in say an apparel site people might be searching by a specific feature or a specific theme say cocktail dresses or formal trousers.
rep,in electronics we've seen people use a lot of linguistic short-cuts like a 42 inch television the word inch could be replaced by double quotes or people today are so used to finding information on google that we see a lot of natural language search right.
rep,people might be looking for something on sale people might want to do some non product searches where they want to look at your returns policy shipping policy and they want them to be redirected to the right sections of the website.
rep,and again you don't have to do any of this manually our system automates most of these experiences it's not that we've solved for relevancy 100 percent but we're about 90 percent accurate for most of these use cases and i will take you through some of them as we go along right.
rep,so these are some of the issues i found and these were some of the top keywords that i found in google like conversion calculator i did not see any results.
rep,i looked for a resistor color code calculator i did not see any result i looked for a circuit diagram maker this is there under your documentation i did not find a result.
rep,then i looked for some specific use cases where i know this is in this is manufactured by apem i'm looking for a specific push-button switch but when i search for it it does not take me to that exact product page nor it takes me to a page where it actually shows me okay there are these 10-15 things available.
rep,it's doing a text pattern match it's pulling up everything which is loosely relevant to a switch or a push button or apem as a brand and it's giving me a large result set to review.
rep,this is something that might impact customer experience on the site which is what if we could help you and i'll show you some use cases of what we've done right.
rep,and and then i did a similar one i specifically looked for a diji international computer single board probably this is this or something similar at what i wanted to look at but again i go i have to go through a large result set to narrow my search narrow my experience to the exact product i wanted this is one of the experiences i saw.
rep,and then finally i look for a slide potentiometer you actually have a nice category navigation where you show me all these but when i search for it is where the issue is because you're showing me a bunch of other things then i have to click on this to actually get into this.
rep,so these were some of the experiences i could see that can be optimized i'm pretty sure you're aware of all these so i just thought i'll see where the opportunity is for us any any comments on this.
prospect,no they're very good example.
rep,and i'll also take you through sorry david please go ahead.
prospect,you've done a good job of doing homework.
rep,thank you that's my job so but yeah what i'll do is i'll also take you through some of the use cases we have solved for it's.
rep,it's easy to point issues with anybody's site but it's not very easy to solve for it right.
rep,some of the things we've tried doing like tried using some parallel examples like black logitech wireless keyboard or look for a very specific exact match as i look for a bright hair sixteen point two ounce spray bottle right.
rep,so for you to show the right results you have to understand the context of what the user is looking for and we do a fairly reasonably good job in that i'll show you some more examples i again this is in apparel but the reason i showed you this example is because it's so specific i'm specifically looking for a full sleeve office wear for women.
rep,so a it should get into a category then it should looking for a specific theme and then it's looking for a specific product but it still shows up the right results.
rep,so that's typically what i wanted to show you here and then we also solve for part number matches pretty well you don't have to have the exact part number mentioned even a partial part number will give you options.
rep,and while you're actually typing the part number it will actually start showing you options in an auto suggest functionality itself so that you really don't have to go through a complete search experience to find the product.
rep,and and we have a great indexing speed so indexing and relevancies are our core strength we index about 5000 products a second and we can consume a fairly large catalog and index them in the right way.
rep,if i could ask what would be the potential sku count we could be looking at if we have to work with dig-key it's over a million skus or or is it under a million skus.
prospect,i have no input.
rep,let's say about a million five million parts okay that's a good number.
rep,right and then some examples of non products searches the intent here is like if i click on returns i click on about as i click on order status ideally it should redirect me to the exact page and that is what we do all these are automated redirects unless you want to overwrite the manually.
rep,and then we also do compatibility searches just as an example and we also solve for natural language things like some product on sale will also in most cases give you the right result so the relevancy is a lot more contextual that way any questions on this so far.
rep,so another thing that i did notice obviously you have a lot of filters like one of the customers we work with ib supply for example the mid-segment space they have close to 6000 filters for their 400000 skus.
rep,a we give you the ability to define faceting for every category even for in every sub-category a say for casual shoes you can define filter you can define attributes in the way you want and then as a user i can come and search for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes men's nike men's adidas the results will appear in the same order of attribution.
rep,and then it's dynamic because if we figure that say an ankle height is more clicked filter than size then ankle height automatically moves up on top you don't have to do this manually we can do this automatically right.
rep,similarly it works for casual shirts as well and then then finally on zero result pages the reason i put up this slide is to show the users some call-to-action instead of showing the sorry message with a blank page show them some recommendation with widgets it could be recently viewed it could be your top sellers so that the user has some call-to-action to do instead of actually staring at a blank page so that was another suggestion i had.
prospect,none.
rep,great so and david just a quick reference document on how we do this from a technology standpoint these are the five things we do for every query that is inputted by a search box and i'll take you through what we do in each of these things right.
rep,the first thing that we do is something called a semantic relevance because today essentially more such systems dealing with this problem where they're probably doing an and-ing or they're doing an or-ing or they're doing a minimal match right.
rep,the problem with this approach is that either you show too many products or you to show too few products or you probably show irrelevant products.
rep,and then you'll have to manually merchandise these queries to actually solve for it right.
rep,so i've just taken an example i know it's in the apparel space but it'll give you some context right for say a query like woman's white jeans this is essentially how it will show up.
rep,because most search systems use this rule called tf-idf which either gives you you a popularity score or a rarity score.
rep,what we have done is we have added something called as usefulness score because it as per tf-idf if you look at the scores that assigns for women white and jeans it'll give the maximum score to white then to women then to jeans.
rep,but in the e-commerce context the opposite is true actually jeans is the most popular this has to be given the maximum weightage then it should be women then it should be white right.
rep,so we add something called as relevant gain or usefulness score to all our to the idf score and hence we are able to start promoting products in the right way.
rep,so we essentially displace products and burry them which are not relevant.
rep,so that's the first stage that we do here and we call it a semantic relevance right.
prospect,whats idea of the inverse is it inverse frequency.
rep,yeah inverse document frequency.
rep,so this is how you like google uses this this was an algorithm which was built in the 70s even google uses the same algorithm but the problem is it's good for document search but it is not good for e-commerce search because in e-commerce the context could be very different like the example i told you right.
rep,so this is the first step that we do right the second step what what we do is we start doing exclusions right again the top is not a jeans so we start excluding the top and replacing that by jeans right.
rep,once we do this stage two the third is we start adding machine learning behavior right so we what first thing that we do when we start our implementation is to install our analytics and we start reading through clickstream data so that we understand how how people are actually buying products in the site right.
rep,so based on that clickstream data we come up with a product user behavior score and then we assign a score for each product so that we know which product was actually most popular right.
rep,the score as per this actual score as per semantic relevance this product might have the maximum score but from clickstream data we realize that this product is the most popular hence we essentially replace these products and then show them to a user right.
rep,and then finally we also look for any merchandising boosts that you might have done.
rep,one distinct difference that we have against say an endeca or anybody else is when you do a apply a boosting rule it it applies to the entire catalog what we do is we restrict the boosting rule for that query so that if you heavily boost a product it does not show up in all the irrelevant places it only shows up within the category so that is something that we do.
rep,and then finally we also add personalization to the entire behavior personalization is where we can start doing segmentation we can do segmentation by geo.
rep,if your parts change per store location if stores is where you deliver the product from so you don't you want to only show products which are actually available in your inventory you can actually do segmentation by geo then you can actually do segmentation by channel.
rep,if you're actually spending money on your ppc campaigns and on your email campaigns you want to make sure that you also create something for people who are landing to your site from those campaigns so we help you do segmentation by geo right.
rep,and we can also do segmentation by user type new user versus repeat user what kind of products you want to show to them.
rep,essentially six broad segments which we can help you target right and this is like a high level architecture we have built the entire platform on scene.
rep,we've essentially hacked on the scene and essentially built all these full confidence over the top of it which makes us very different from what people would have made using the solr or in elastic search infrastructure.
rep,and it's a lot of information that i spelt out but just thought i'll give you a quick context of how we do this any questions on this david stacy.
prospect,not from me but david <the design guys does> it's interesting.
rep,okay i hope you found it useful though.
prospect,yeah i find your presentation very impressive you did a very very good job of pulling us together very impressive i would say.
rep,thank you sir and beyond this all these are automated functionalities i spoke about but we also understand you understand your business better than us so we also have a back-end dashboard especially for your merchandising theme and also for data sciences team to actually come and look at reporting and we made it extremely comprehensive right.
rep,this is a quick <ideal> view of the dashboard this is where you can manage multiple sub-domains you might have or if you have a different environment for staging for production you can essentially you can manage everything from a single console.
rep,this is essentially where you can go and set user access rights like what different peoples with different titles can actually see different sections on the dashboard and this gives you an executive summary so this gives you all your number of search queries your product views your add to carts and orders.
rep,we have a dashboard similar to this like for our product recommendation also for our category navigation as well and then this gives you a high level metric.
rep,and then you can go and drill down in fairly comprehensive reporting in the search dashboard you can go and look for reporting on search and also for your autocomplete as well.
rep,and this gives the first section gives you high level reporting sorry my site is a little my internet is a little slow today so sorry for that.
rep,so this gives you a high overview just you can look at all your search heads you can compare it with any metric you want to and it gives you the top metrics like which is your top search queries your zero results your clicked products and your ordered products.
rep,all this can be downloaded into a csv and can be reviewed and then we do the extra mile.
rep,we also give you individual query reporting where you can actually go and drill down by every single query on your site and see how each query is performing like if dress is an important query here you can now go down by and drill down for this query dress look at all the business metrics associated with this query and then see how is this query performing and the products associated to that.
rep,so if this week if this query is doing three point two six percent conversion and last week it was actually doing three was probably doing four percent you can now go and see which are the products which have gone out of inventory because of which the performance of this query dropped.
rep,like we have done this for a query you can on our category dashboard you can also do it for every single product as well any questions on this.
rep,and then you can also look at similar reports for your auto fill as well your in feature your keyword suggestion your top queries popular products however you have constructed it it'll give you metrics on all the auto suggest options as well right.
rep,and then finally we have a merchandising dashboard this is like if your merchandisers have used endeca experience manager it has all the functionalities for endeca experience manager but it's probably one hundred less complicated than that.
rep,it's more for 2017 dashboard right i have a quick video which i can which i think will do more justice to this just play that videos but that's more easier and covers all the sections.
rep,this is a high-level dashboard you can go and create custom landing pages you can create the campaigns everything that you want to do for every query and every category as well.
rep,you can define a campaign you can have a specific start date and end date for any campaign you want to create and once you've created that you can go ahead and start defining an audience for that campaign right.
rep,in this audience is where i spoke about the segmentation you can specifically create a campaign for your new users for your repeat users you can create a campaign for a specific device type people are coming in from a desktop versus mobile.
rep,you can create a campaign for people coming from a specific geography today you can actually go and drill down by a zip code and then you can also create a campaign for every specific channel right.
rep,and then as you start selecting your segmentation logic it will also give you an indicator as to what's the potential reach of this campaign okay and once you've chosen your audience different marketing teams might have different ideas.
rep,so what we've also done is built an a/b test feature within the dashboard where if team a has idea a and team b has idea b they can essentially test do a live a/b test and decide the winner by say clicks or conversions whatever metric you wanna follow so that you're more certain as to what actually makes sense to you guys right.
rep,and once you've defined all this now you can go in merchandise you can do boosting you can do slotting you can do sorting or you can do pinning and again all of them can be a simple drag drop feature and as you keep creating the rules it will start showing your preview of all the actions you're actually taking on the dashboard and then you can essentially review that before you actually go ahead and publish it.
rep,i'm sorry for the information overload but i just wanted to cover all the elements of the tool.
rep,stacy do you have a specific tool that you've built in-house to manage merchandising today.
prospect,well actually we have <sycorei on oracle pages just got installed using our personalization>.
rep,i think i had biggest differentiator from most of the other partners of their is because we do product discovery end to end we also help you with site search we can help you with product recommendations we can power your category pages and we have a merchandising dashboard.
rep,so that it's more easier for you to essentially run everything with the same vendor but but again you can also use a <dialer card> you can still use us just for search and use somebody else for any other tool so you have both the options available.
rep,so yeah this was a quick snapshot on the merchandising dashboard any questions on this so far this was like a high level tour of the entire product so just wanted to stop answer any questions and then get into the implementation bit.
rep,and david stacy our pricing is based on the number of search sessions if you just look at our search product and it is based on the overall site sessions if you looking at the entire product discovery product line that we're talking about right.
rep,and as i told you we have a poc model you don't have to see give us any commitment to you actually see the revenue uptake we can come in i'll discuss about the implementation approaches as well.
prospect,do you actually i mean do you send the presentation to us at all.
rep,yes absolutely.
prospect,that would be great because i think the piece here that important from us is you know i would need to share with our it team.
rep,just a quick question stacy in terms of how the year has been planned off for you guys is there a window available for us to do a poc this year.
prospect,i don't know that would be something that i would need to talk to it well.
rep,okay again as i told you the intent is to involve as little of your time as possible we can technically if especially if you choose the impage ajax approach all we need from you is your catalogue about an hour of your developer's time to install our analytics and then once the entire configuration is put in a staging platform a few days of your developer's time to do testing that's about it.
rep,we will do all the work at our end and then you can either do an a/b test just to see a side-by-side comparison you can push fifty percent of your traffic on your existing infrastructure and the remaining 50% on unbxd and and see if we are at least 10% better at a minimum compared to your existing system so you can actually do that.
prospect,okay it was a very nice presentation i like <the user> site for example.
rep,okay thank you so much and do you want us to schedule a follow-up call in about a week or two weeks to discuss if there is a feasibility for us to do a poc in the next quarter or the third quarter of the year do you think that's okay.
prospect,i would say for me i david and i should probably have a conversation first i should probably share that document with somebody from it and so i think i wouldn't set anything up yet.
prospect,you're welcome to check back with us there and i would give it three weeks because i know myself i'm traveling the next two weeks.
rep,would you be in shoptalk by any chance.
prospect,no no i'm going to florida and then i'm just traveling here in minnesota.
rep,okay no worries.
rep,okay again thank you both for your time and have a great weekend ahead.
prospect,you too.
prospect,excellent presentation.
rep,thank you sir.
prospect,you are welcome.
rep,suzane hi.
rep,sharath here from unbxd how are you doing.
prospect,i'm good thank you how are you tell me your name again.
rep,my name is sharath.
prospect,sharath.
prospect,nice to meet you.
rep,nice to meet you too thank you so much for attending this call and giving us this time.
prospect,you're welcome i attended a webinar recently and was impressed with that content so that was a gateway to to you know attract people.
rep,thank you i definitely give this feedback to my marketing team.
rep,and suzane just a quick check so you currently are in charge of digital marketing and you are in charge of the digital marketing for all your channels or for all your websites i know willowtree is one and you have a bunch of other sites as well.
prospect,correct yeah.
rep,okay okay that's pretty enough so i work here as a product <of a dualist> as a part of my role i essentially work with a bunch of retailers across the us with the primary motives being to talk about product discovery importance of product discovery whether it's site search or product recommendation or category navigation or merchandising and try and influence as to how people are doing product recommendations today to what we at as unbxd do.
rep,and in my role essentially work very closely with my products team in terms of keeping them aware of what the industry wants from from a partner and essentially building our entire core products around what the industry needs us to build so that's essentially the role i play.
rep,yeah specific to this call i think we're focusing on willowtree just tell me if you can see my screen suzane.
rep,you can right okay so one of the core focuses of this call was to essentially give you a quick background who we are i know you would have heard about us in the webinar as well but then very very specific and focused on willowtree look at the product discovery experience on willowtree today and also share some common use cases of what we've done for other customer so that there's something for you to take back to your team. and then we could definitely spend some time on showing you how we can do merchandising again you might have gotten a high level snapshot on how we do merchandising in the webinar but we can probably dig dive a little bit deeper and speak to you about that.
rep,and and then i think one of the standout points in the webinar is unlike other partners we essentially give you an opportunity to test our product and show you a minimum 10% uptake in conversions before you need to make a decision on a longer term commitment with us so i'll also talk to you on how that works and and then look for your feedback on how you would want to proceed going forward so does that sound like a plan overall.
prospect,i'm open to it.
rep,okay great so i essentially have timed this to about 40 to 45 minutes i just wanted to reconfirm you have that 45 minutes for us today.
rep,okay awesome great so let me get started but before i just go to get started just two quit hygiene questions so i do understand your e-commerce platform is demandware you use the native search from demandware today or do you have a custom thing that you've built on solr on or on elastic search to solve the site search.
prospect,right now it is in the demandware functionality and we know we have some areas for improvement there that we hope to capitalize on in 2017.
rep,okay that's good to know thank you so let me get started a quick background i'm sorry this could be a little repetitive but i'll keep it very short as a company we are roughly about five and a half years old headquartered here in san francisco we have two officers here plus we have a customer success team based out of chicago plus we have an international operations set up bangalore india.
rep,primarily because we have a bunch of customers in india china and in australia and we thought india could be a good central point for us to get some good engineers and also run of full-fledged international operations.
rep,the good thing about the company we have had enough success in every vertical in the fashion is in the faction space essentially we have found our most amount of success express rue21 us patriot burks outlet are all fairly decent-sized names in the fashion space but again it could be hardware it could be electronics it could be mass merchant it would be pharma or it could be home improvements there's a good amount of success to this we've had.
rep,and i think one thing that we've tested ourselves really well is irrespective of your platform it could be demandware in in your case or it could be atg or websphere the solution works without any issues on any platform that you could be on so roughly we power about 1200 global sites today across the globe large concentration in the us about 75% of our customers are us-based but we do have some good penetration into other global markets as well.
rep,any questions on this so far.
rep,great so another important thing is as to why search right essentially that's one of the roles i play as to look at trends as to how people are taking product discovery seriously like if you look at even say 24 months ago most of the heads of marketing and e-commerce would have probably not put search as the top three priorities in their entire stack for the year but what has changed in the last 12 months especially as a the percentage of traffic through search has anywhere being between 30 to 40 percent for most retailers in mass merchants in marketplaces and fashion and apparel it's a lot higher but what has changed significantly is the percentage conversions on search is sometimes 2x of site conversions.
rep,i'm not sure what's the scenario at your end but generally as a market trend i've notice that search conversion rates are much higher than your site conversion rates which effectively means that search is powering anywhere between 30 to 50 percent of overall revenues and hence it's become extremely critical right and one of the things that we do while we power site search and product discovery as an entire product suite just to make sure that you at least see an immediate impact within the first 90 days of the poc.
rep,and for somebody like in express within the first 90 days of them going live we improved their conversions by roughly 27% this essentially made this ceo go to wall street and talk about how they on boarded a partner and the partner made a very very significant impact on their bottom line right.
rep,and this was like a quick snippet as to how the search was before us and after us right you look for blue jeans it's showing me products are probably blue in color but not necessarily everything is jeans but after us it's essentially showing you the right products of the from a user perspective that a user might want to see right and this is test on the conversion rate uptake is not restricted to fashion apparel only here you could see multiple verticals multiple search technologies that we've replace in multiple e-commerce platform that we've worked with.
rep,two consistent things you will notice is one ias the uptake in conversions and the second significant thing is the uptake in revenue and i'm happy to organize some reference calls for you if you decide to probably movehead with us to talk to specific retailers on how we've been able to meet the difference.
rep,any question so far.
prospect,no i think i mean for us you know big challenges we we have other issues on our site for example we have to sell our product at msrp and everywhere else is discounting our product and so you know people are just more savvy shoppers and they realize that they can get it for much cheaper on amazon for example so while we're able to drive traffic to our site they're not converting so i think you know while search might be a factor for us you know we we also have other issues that we need to fix.
rep,i agree to that.
prospect,enable ourselves to be competitive so.
rep,yeah since you brought up the amazon point i think one of the things that we'll focus on on these use cases is if if we can create at least an amazon like user experience for all your users right i know there's a pricing issue the msrp that you have to solve as a business but at least from an experience perspective if we can create an amazon experience for your users that might help in upping the conversion rates to some extent.
prospect,okay (umhh).
rep,and i'll take you through as to what are those use cases i'm talking about and i'm happy to tell more and one thing as a disclaimer some of the examples i might show you there might be some repetition to what you've heard in the session but i'll try and keep it as as low as possible okay.
rep,so as you go through the use cases what i've done is essentially track the entire product discovery experience of a customer on your site on specially willowtree what will he see first what can what can he see next and what is that he gets to see <unclear and broken voices> an ornament which is a category on your site.
rep,the options i got this was pretty good because you're actually segmenting it for me guiding me through whether you want the best ornament you want ornament for a specific occasion and or a specific theme and you're showing me the right set of autosuggest option which is pretty good to have right.
rep,but when i try doing something which is of two words or something which is probably not extremely common on your site though you have a category for tree toppers essentially the same guided navigation i get here i essentially don't see it here right.
rep,i'm not sure if it's by design or is it something that you've essentially looked at the top keywords that you have on your site and and probably made it more easier on the top keywords but probably this is not a top keyword and hence you don't see that option so that is something i don't know but we can probably take it as food for thought right.
prospect,okay(umhh).
rep,and one thing that we do specifically for our customers like though we power 1200 web sites i can give you 12 names for you to go and look at one thing you'll notice is the entire experience on auto suggest is extremely custom right one thing that we've tried doing is essentially build this autosuggest not as something that you need to have as a part of your product discovery experience but is that something that is creating an impact for your end users and i'll take you through some very specific use cases for that right.
rep,so a few examples i can show you one is i'm not sure if you've seen the saw this example on the webinar right these guys essentially sell parts online right and before they came on board to us if you've seen their archived site of 2014 you would have noticed two different search boxes like one to search by a part number and one to search by model name right because their philosophy was there are two kinds of customers who come to us one who exactly knows which part number to buy and the other person who probably is fairly naive and probably comes and looks for a model name right.
rep,they thought having two search boxes will solve the problem but essentially having these two search experiences amplified the problem because the relevancy got skewed so what we did for them is the first thing from a navigation perspective we built them apart finder where they can essentially go and find any part in three clicks and from first from the search perspective we unified the experience like if you pick the first name here bissell right.
rep,one thing you would notice is the autosuggest is customized in a way where one side you would see parts the other side you would see model numbers and then they wanted segmentation by geo right if i'm coming in from san francisco and say you're coming in from kansas city right what is specific to people looking on your site from kansas city versus san francisco essentially is what should show up in the top searches so we segmented it for them right i mean something that we built very custom for them.
rep,whereas if you go to an apparel site like say us patriot they're also like you fail in niche because they said military apparel to non-military personnel and for them their analytics suggested that 80% of the products bought in the site was from one single brand nike because a people know about nike but the issue that caused was since they are so niche they also have a lot of manufacturers in texas who manufacture products for them.
rep,but as an end-user i don't even know about these brands so how will i discover those brands right and c since the products are slightly expensive their average order value was roughly about $150 they also wanted a recommendation widget to show up in the autosuggest which will show all the popular products.
rep,so the way we built it for them is the moment i start typing in ni in this case i'm thinking as nike as a user a we give them a guided scope to show them what are the top-selling subcategories within nike as a brand and then you also expose them to the other brands in the inventory which as a user i wouldn't be even been aware of.
rep,we do segmentation by geo for the queries and we show a visual representation of all the popular products in their site right again something built very customed right then if you go to on express the way we have built an auto suggest for them is to show a category scope.
rep,like i start looking for jeans it shows me jeans fro men and jeans for women and depending on my location it will start picking up what was the most popular products show displayed in the location and we gave them a segmentation logic here where it either display by location or they can display by popularity as to okay red jeans is probably the most popular jeans sold this week so show red jeans and again show the men women and then show all the top queries.
rep,and as i keep hovering around the auto suggests the products also changed correspondingly right and then lastly if i look at a grocery like big basket is now the largest e-grocers in southeast asia so for them people buy above 20 products in a transaction so essentially you're talking about going through 60 to 70 pdp pages.
rep,so they wanted a quick search also to have a quick add to cart option and the way we built it for them is the moment i start typing in chicken on the site we've given them an option to change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box plus show them all the commonly searched terms the popular brands and the categories.
rep,and the reason i gave you these four examples suzane is if you look at these four examples none of the two are actually similar to each other we've built something very custom with the primary focus being how can we make it from an experience perspective how can we make it a wow effect for your end users from another side make sense any questions.
rep,suzane.
rep,okay no i just want to make sure if it is making sense to you.
prospect,yeah i mean it's not really relevant to us because we you know just have this one brand and you know i i see what you're saying but it's much more robust than like our current need for willowtree for example.
rep,okay yeah there's a few things that you could look at doing is essentially try and do more of a theme-based autosuggest like you have themes right for multiple occasions the auto suggests could essentially reflect the theme like you're showing it for ornament just not for the category but even for a specific product that you might be looking at you can essentially make it theme based which might be more relevant something that you could take back this was on auto suggest specifically right.
rep,the second thing that might be more relevant is essentially from a spellcheck perspective right today one of the ways you might be doing spell-check is to essentially create a manual list of synonyms right i did some simple checks of misspelling a single letter in the word ornament and also in the word tree topper right.
rep,right automatically it is not showing me any results right one thing that you could do is since it's done manually today you can automate this whole experience so that you don't have to depend on a it person or a marketing person is constantly keeps looking at zero results and try and update the synonym corpus manually right.
rep,one thing we've done is essentially trained the system to autocorrect up to six words misspelled in a single phrase like if you look at this example black leather jacket on express
rep,you can try this query yourself what we've done is we've auto corrected this to black leather jacket and just not the auto correction but we're also starting to display results right from the word flow this might save a lot of time at you are at your end with whoever is doing this manual entry at this point in time.
rep,and the similar situation is for stemmed words right i look at angels versus angel right angels takes me directly to the category page while angel shows me results on angel which essentially are slightly different from each other but the the what i wanted to point out here was for me as a user my user intent isn't changing with a singular or plural word.
rep,my intent remains the same but again since you'll have to go and build this manually you end up leaving out some gaps where you have to constantly keep looking for something like this right whereas with us if you go to express however you want to spell the word t-shirts or even just call a tees you will find the same set of results right again these are simple things that could save a lot of time for your team and save the headache of actually keep track of everything manually whereas you can actually do this in an automated fashion.
rep,right and just a quick curious question if what is the size of the catalogue today on willowtree.
prospect,we'll have about 200 200 and 20 skus.
rep,okay and for your other sites is it similar numbers or it's much larger.
prospect,6000 that's 6000 skus.
rep,okay yeah because if you look at 6000 skus overall is <abandoned> then you're essentially looking at probably 30 40 thousand synonyms that might have to be created for managing stemmed words and spell check issues which can be completely automated so that's probably one thing that you could take away and see if that makes sense to your team right.
rep,so <> now covered auto suggest and error correction another thing that i just wanted to point out was from an infrastructure standpoint how fast your search results load on the site generally if you look at internet retailer general recommended scope is if the search results can load within 300 milliseconds.
rep,did a quick check of your site loads well in the east under the threshold but as you go further away especially to the west the speed becomes much slower right one thing that we do is since we are front-ended by a cdn like cloud front our consistencies in terms of speed and being within the threshold is fairly accurate like we tested on express on black friday which is the biggest day of the year that 17x regular traffic.
rep,but one thing that you would notice is irrespective of the load on the site the results were loading in the most optimal manner so that's probably another small thing that you could do from a user experience standpoint which might and and again all these examples i'm trying to give you is since you noted that amazon is a place where people might go and buy all these small things when you add it up will start creating an amazon kind of an experience for users.
rep,okay and then then getting into the core aspects of why you would probably look at any partner for search right which is relevancy right one thing that we've done differently which you would have heard a lot in in the demo that you attended is essentially if you try and understand how people look for information today there are broadly 12 ways people look for information right.
rep,if you are a catalogue company they might if they have a catalogue print catalog that they get to their homes they might essentially copy paste an entire exact name of the product where they're essentially doing an exact search or in your case where it's probably more relevant that people might come and search a specific occasion or a theme right.
rep,or if somebody is very new to your site they've not exactly know the breadth of the products you sell they might use a natural language query right so probably new arrival products or products on sale and things like that right so they're essentially 12 ways people look for information on any e-commerce site.
rep,so one thing that we've done while we were building this platform apart from all the machine learning logic we've built is essentially built algorithms which can solve for each of these queries out of the box hence the name was actually unbxd right and what i did as a part of finding out some use cases for you i tried picking up a few of such traumatic queries and tried searching for them and tried looking at what the user experience will actually be.
rep,and what i made a mental note was to use your top queries right we have a tool called <scms> where we essentially can get a perspective on your top 50 keywords on the site i tried using some of those top queries and start started looking for information on that right.
rep,so one of the things i did is is for an exact query write like new beginnings is category on your site right it's a theme that you have.
rep,when i go to new beginnings it's a category page but when i essentially search for new beginnings essentially get zero results.
rep,and these are few basic things you can actually fix because with us we essentially have an automated redirect option where we can automatically redirect a user searching for something which matches a category page directly into a category page right.
rep,another query that i tried finding which was one of your top five keywords is the nativity family right it's one of your top keywords that i found on google i'm not sure if it was this month or last month but i searched for it essentially again i did not find any results right.
rep,but if you go to an express look for some very very deep-rooted product queries right like a blue straight leg slim fit jeans it can be as specific as this or something like the skinny dress pants right what we do is a we show them the right products what you not what you would not see here is we doing a text pattern match and showing you some 2000 results we exactly pick what the user wants to see and show him the most relevant results on those right.
rep,and again these things will be very hard to do manually it can be only done by a machine learning system right and then i tried some feature specific queries right tried willowtree ornaments tried willowtree figurines all these are your top 20 keywords did not find anything through search but again an example right i look for a full sleeve office wear for women on express or a black black vneck for women on express i find the most relevant results.
rep,then look for some non product queries right things simple things like return policy there is a one of the top keywords that you have is also willowtree tutorial right i did i ran some search essentially did not get any results on that again right but you can go to express or any of the unbxd sites you will see that these are solved automatically.
rep,and finally i looked at natural language where i looked at new arrival or i look for willowtree signature figurines where you have a navigation option for that when i search for it again i don't find any option so again suzane don't get me wrong the intent here was not to tell you that your search does not work well but for me to.
prospect,but that's your work right we know it's a problem so i agree with all of your examples here i appreciate you pulling them forward.
rep,i just thought it would be a good learning for you because you can take it back to your team and and these are things that can be fixed straight forward with our system you don't have to do anything manually everything will gets automated and that might save a lot of time.
rep,and my intent here is after you fix your msrp which <is from a discount> for sale how can i create a amazon like experience for your users because you're spending all the marketing dollars to get people onto your site how do we make it well worth it for them so that's how i'm trying to that's the reason i brought up these and you can look at express right.
rep,things like blue dress on sale or expensive suits for men each of these natural language gets resolved automatically but if you have to literally try and build a system it will take you a long time to do it but we've we have a system which is now well tested even for fairly large skews.
rep,like express has more than a hundred and fifty thousand skus we've a customer like us auto parts 200 million skus right and we've tested our system for that scale and it'll work like a charm for you because the skus set you have is only probably six thousand overall so that was the only take away <>.
rep,right and another suggestion i have is from a ui perspective some small things that you could do because you have a larger category term like an ornaments right which has multiple subcategories within it one of the ways you could look at structuring the ui is like an example at this right.
rep,mobile is a very broad term that i search for but mobile it could mean a mobile phone a mobile headphone a mobile case and cover or a mobile bluetooth one of the ways is to show a horizontal category scope and vertically it displays the products of the most popular one right.
rep,and this is where our machine learning could also help that if you figure that after say next 30 days that mobile cases were more popular on your site then mobile phone then cases automatically comes up on top and the results you would see is for cases and not for mobiles right.
rep,these are again small ui things that we could also take care of you right another example i just wanted to show you for a designer brand like outnet alexander wang is a designer but this designer that actually sells right from dresses to shoes to shoulder bags right.
rep,so how do you display it in there appropriate way to a user one of the ui suggestions we gave for a customer is to have a vertical scope of multiple subcategories and a horizontal scope to show all the different products right again these ui suggestions can be customized to how you want it but just thought i'd show some options for you that you could probably look and consider right.
rep,and another thing that we can also do is also if you have filters on your sites right i'm not sure how many filters you actually have right there could be filters for size it could be if you're selling fashions or it could be a filter for price right.
rep,one of the things that we also let you is to a give you the ability to define specific attributes for a specific product or a query or a category right and then it is dynamic because say if you have defined filters a b c d and e initially and then after 30 days you figured that people actually clicking on say filter c or filter d more than filter a then filter c automatically comes up on top.
rep,again it is done automatically you don't have to do anything manually on your system and all these will save a lot of time for your team so then they can focus on actually getting more people on the site while the product discovery experience is taken care by us right.
rep,and another thing that we do is like like irrespective of how well you clean system there will be instances that people will come and see a zero results page right instead of them staring at a sorry message or an error message one thing that we strongly recommend is to insert these two recommendation widgets this can do a bunch of things.
rep,if he is a repeated user they can essentially track what he or she has bought in the previous widget and show them which is more relevant for them or if it's a new users we can look at all the popular products that people from that specific location have already bought on the site or what is that user done in the existing session so far and show him or her an option to either go back or move forward instead of them having to restart the entire products discovery experience make sense.
prospect,yeah it's it's a little tough to understand you but from what i can i'm trying to follow along as best i can and and i see that this is definitely another area of opportunity that we actually have on our list to work on next year so yep <i'm like yeah>.
rep,is is my voice better now i'm not sure i think some issue with my headset.
prospect,yeah may be if you talk a little slower than might that might help a little bit yeah.
rep,okay i'll do that definitely right so these were high level product use case science i wanted to show to you that you could essentially benefit.
rep,again the bottom line here that i wanted to convey was a lot of these experiences could be automated so that you don't have to have a team that essentially keeps looking at a day in and day out and try doing manual edits there is an automated system could do it more effectively.
rep,that's essentially a high level takeaway that you could take back and we can prove that to you in a probably a poc or a pilot whenever your team wants to do it next right so this was one in the second thing as a marketer of a merchandiser one thing that might be of interest to you is to how do you run merchandising campaigns today right.
rep,do you have to if you have to run a campaign today or if you have to run a sale once you fix your msrp right or if you want to promote your new arrival products or you want to promote products which have been in stock for a while so you want to push them away from the stock right so most traditional cases you end up depending on it to do some code changes or marketing will have to go through a complex fix to essentially create a campaign.
rep,one of our focus area has been to give that power to a merchandiser or a marketer a we give them all the insights from our analytics as to what query is working what kind of products are selling well and secondly for a merchandiser give them a very simple ui tool where they can go in and make changes and run campaigns on the fly rather than having to wait for a few days or a week to actually go and create a campaign and i probably will take a few minutes just show you how seamless it is to actually do it.
rep,this is like a high level dashboard that we have built this is the new version of the dashboard very sleek very informative in terms of the insights this is one of our older versions i'll just take you through this in terms of examples right.
rep,at a high level you can send us skus right as your product feed you can send us to a send it to us through an xml csv or you can just drop it to an ftp location and we can pick it up.
rep,we as a thumb rule do a full catalogue update once a day and a differential update every three hours but if you have more products and pricing changing changes happening more frequently we can reduce the frequency to as low as 10 minutes as well right so depending on the catalogue that you send us right all the fields are essentially displayed here depending on the autocomplete or the search it might essentially enable or disable any specific field right.
rep,this is essentially where all your facets are displayed you can go and edit any facet or you can go and add a new facet right and then here is where again just to repeat myself you don't have to create any synonyms or stemmed words because if there is a specific jargon that you have which is not very common very very relatable to your industry we also have given you an option to go and add a synonym.
rep,again this is only if you need it otherwise the machine learning will pick it up by itself in a few minutes.
prospect,do you have some clients on the demandware platform that are using unbxd.
rep,we are just in the process of on boarding hallmark they are on demandware they are moving on to us.
prospect,what was the name of the company.
rep,hallmark.
prospect,hallmark hallmark <starting use it>.
rep,yeah so that is one customer that we are in the process of on boarding it's a fairly large complex project within it'll take some time for them to go live but yeah but we've generally seen a bunch of our customers are especially small and medium are on magento or on bigcommerce and most of our large larger customers are on atg.
rep,those are the most common use cases we've seen but of late we are starting to see some demandware use cases as well right.
prospect,what is the cost associated with the platform.
rep,so ours is a monthly cost model it's a sas platform it is based on the number of sessions we actually have per month right so if you have a high level estimate as to what is your number of sessions i can give you an approximate cost number so that you can <use this for something>.
prospect,um well obviously it's a seasonal business so it varies um but yeah i can let me open up my report i can share with you what the averages.
rep,even an average will work.
prospect,what the averages.
rep,we usually follow an annual bucket model like if you say i get about 50000 searches a month on an average right then we can give you a bucket of half a million search sessions for the year or six six hundred thousand search session for the year and depending on how your traffic flows you can start consuming from that bucket we can do that that's very easy to do.
rep,and since you have domains you can essentially manage all your domains right from the same dashboard we also give you the ability to create specific user access rights you have specific people in your team were allowed to use specific sections of the dashboard you can essentially go and create this custom settings for them.
rep,this is a high level dashboard <moveable> and most importantly merchandising in merchandising we let you merchandise for all your search results we also help you merchandise for all your category pages as well right to give you a quick example as to how simple it is to merchandise right we just created a simple demo site for apparel right let's say dress is a important query probably your top ten queries as per google right.
rep,now if you wanna merchandise this all your merchandiser has to do is to create a rule click on merchandise right everything that's shown on your site with the same number in the same order essentially comes up on the <bottle> right now he or she can filter product to a specific attribute.
rep,the attributes could be as complex as margins as well right or he or she can run promotions in promotions they can do sorting they can do boosting or they can do sloughing or they can create a custom landing page or a banner where you can have an image banner on your home page if somebody clicks on that banner they essentially land into a page which you have displayed right exactly what you want the users to see right.
rep,and to give you an example it's super easy to do boosting if your merchandiser wants to boost this query you can either do it with the lever or he can boost it by a attribute like a random attributes say title like since you have long title <> you can say title contains say in this list aliza so as soon as you do all aliza products comes up here.
rep,merchandiser can simply drag and drop and pin a product to a particular location like i can pin this and position one pin this one position two or position four right and now if there are too many products to drag and drop what he or she can do is just do a slotting where say positions 5 to 6 are always want say ralph lauren brand to show up because it gives me the largest margin some estimate right so ralph lauren products will show on top.
rep,now if you go back to your site and click on dress again one and four were the two places you pinned the product and five and six were the two products you slotted automatically becomes available on the <means>.
rep,so this gives a lot of ability for a marketer or merchandise to run campaigns at his or her way.
prospect,okay um so i just looked willowtree has about on average a hundred thousand um just a little over a hundred thousand sessions per month so that way what.
rep,and would you know how many searches per month sessions is one metric would you know how many searches that you have per month sessions.
rep,okay i can take an estimate which is the industry estimate if you got thirty to twenty five to thirty percent.
rep,so for search alone you are looking at a pricing of roughly about a thousand to twelve fifty dollars a month.
prospect,a thousand a month.
rep,correct right.
prospect,and this is something that you can turn on and off then or is it you have to contract for a year.
rep,so what we do is essentially do a poc with you we have a three month pilot where we come on board implement the solution you use the solution for two months after implementation we implemented in 30 days and then you have 60 days to use the solution.
rep,we will show you in those 60 days there is at least a 10% uptake in conversions that you have say if your current conversions is 2% will guarantee that it at least go to  2 point 2 percent only if you see that you can then contract for a year so you try it first before you start looking at a one-year commitment so that's how.
prospect,what involved in the implementation.
rep,it is one of the most seamless implementation you would have ever heard of we follow a process called in page ajax like if you go to express today i'll just show you what in page ajax is like i look for jeans right you have this header you have this footer right this is all that you provide us and you provide an empty page an empty div tag and this results are now printed by unbxd we are doing the html injection onto this since we are doing this all the dev work is actually done at our end.
rep,all we do is in the 30 days if have to tell what is your effort estimate in week one you give us access like a read-only access to your ga you also give us a copy of your catalog feed right those are the two things we do and then you give us some advice on how you want the your <> to look like right do you use the standard one that we have or you want something custom right.
rep,those are the only three inputs you give us initially then we build anything at our back end like we build this error correction rules the stemming rules the relevancy rules they build everything and then we place it on the staging environment in about four weeks.
rep,then your team can test it for one or two days just to look at multiple keywords and see if everything is making fine making sense to you and then you go live that's it.
rep,like very very minimal effort like if i have to count in terms of percentages probably a 20-80 split between the amount of effort your team has to put versus the amount of effort our team has to put and then you go live.
prospect,you have that somewhere where you can share with me like you know here's how it works a little overview of the what you're proposing and you know the steps to implementation the cost etc do you can you provide me with a proposal that includes that information.
rep,absolutely so i'll forward you.
prospect,also i'd like to i'd like to understand who you're working with at hallmark because we have several colleagues over there and i would love to connect with them on on their experience you know i think it'll be good to learn learn from them and.
rep,yeah i can give you that information with hallmark as i told you we've just on boarded them as from a poc perspective so the implementation they'd only go live i think my end of feb but i can let you know who we are working with who do we are working with so that you can connect with them but we're happy to give you other use cases of references of anybody else that you might want to speak to.
prospect,okay great thank you so much for i mean this has been really interesting very good information and i look forward to you know getting some documentation and visiting with my hallmark colleagues and in a circling back with you in the new year.
rep,sure and would you have any high-level timeline as to when you might want to do a pilot with us will it happen sometime in q1 or will it be slightly later in the year.
prospect,i'm not even that far along yet i'm still trying to understand how we would you know fit it in and i actually have not presented my 2017 plan yet to our leadership team so you know we're still working through what we're gonna do next year and i think that would be solidified till january or february anyway so it would probably not be you know the beginning of the year for sure okay yeah that's obviously good context so let me do this i'll forward you the implementation document and also i will send you some sample pricing information so you do have a reference on that and then we <> from your side if you want us to do a tech call with any of your developers to them to understand what's involved we're happy to schedule those things.
prospect,okay okay yeah and feel free to send along the the presentation you gave today and i appreciate your time thank you so much.
rep,thank you so much suzane good talking to you happy holidays ahead.
prospect,you too bye bye.
prospect,you sent to me that's that's all completely it's not so completely valid so so we are just looking at you know three or four different vendors we have already had communications with sli searchspring as an example to try to determine which vendors is best suited for either our industry or for just search search and recommendations general in itself what kind of in the discovery process peter but it will sit on top of our new site you know relatively soon i mean there's this summer it will go live so.
rep,okay well that helps in just curious what platform are you going with.
prospect,it's a hybrid so the the main part of it will fit on big commerce but the information is going to be pulling from an expert system that we run already so.
rep,okay okay that helped send you know so just so that you know the agenda that i put together today was kind of essentially walk you through a little bit of background and unbxd how we helping retailers such as yourself i don't know how you know if you'd like me to walk you through the customer experience study so you know it looks like you already went through that report but but do let me know if you if you want me to kind of walk you through some of those results that because on your site and and you know kind of talk to you about some some of the areas that we can help with and also share some best practices that we see working with retailers such as yourself.
rep,so is there anything else in specific you like to add or you know .
prospect,no i haven't going through the report would be interesting as well you know because while we're reading platforming we're also changing a lot of our data structure you know with searching line just based off of what what we think we would like to do or what what our customer feedback has been for the last year or so so we thought it would be interesting see what your feedback would be as well you know as a as a potential potentially actually providing to dissolution so.
rep,absolutely i'll be happy to do that as well so just to give you a quick background and unbxd we're essentially a product discovery company we use machine learning and advanced data scientist to essentially help connect your shoppers to the products they are most likely to buy and and what i mean by that is we we one our technology understands your shopper intent and it's able to make easier for your shoppers to find the product they are looking for and two we also understand that product discovery has you know a couple of different components to it you know other than just site search shoppers kid you know also coming to your site look for a product you know browse through your pages without really using the search so that's another area that we help out with as well .
rep,and the last piece to it would be the product recommendations like you just mentioned a few minutes ago where you know you decide you want to recommend products cross-sell upsell in that ways you know you get more and more out of the customer that's shopping on your site.
rep,and so from a customer standpoint this just to give you an idea so we work with roughly about hundred and twenty enterprise customers most of our business is here in the us but we're also rapidly expanding into europe and asia .
rep,so we've seen some success in the fashion space we work with retailers like express comm rue 21 we've also from home improvement stan phone we work with brands like ashley home store one of the largest furniture retailers in the us we've also started working with bed bath and beyond
rep,and you know so we've kind of had success with not just you know one vertical and it's multiple verticals just because the technology is designed in such a way where it's a machine learning platform and you know it kind of caters to to your business so you know i unfortunately i don't we don't have a wine customer yet but but yeah we look forward to having one and yeah hopefully that's you so uh.
rep,and from a platform standpoint as well so you mentioned bigcommerce so one of the retailers on big commerce and we work with.
rep,i'll show you some examples on the site as well it's us patriot tactical so they're they're a large enterprise customer from bigcommerce maybe you could you could get some context on some of the things that we're doing for a similar bigcommerce bigcommerce customer and we're also sorry ashish go ahead.
rep,i'm sorry to cut you that so sorry but justin we have also with a customer with similar infrastructure like yours that in they had netsuite at the back end and then they bigcommerce front end so we also again.
rep,thanks ashish perfect and so just to kind of jump into the customer experience study we put together so what we do normally is we assess your you know so this is mostly from a site standpoint where we kind of look at the relevancy aspect of your site search we look at you know whether how good your auto suggests is if you have an autocomplete because we feel that that's important to kind of help guide the customer to their to their shopping journey we also look at synonym system words and error tolerance to see how your search responds if let's say someone were to misspell a specific query or if if someone looks for a synonym which is not really on on your catalog and and the last piece is also we apply all of the above from a mobile standpoint to see how you know you search performs on a mobile device.
rep,and so so the basis of you know how we built a technology was you know we figured out that normally all search queries could be bucketed into twelve different types so normally people will look let's say from from a product standpoint somebody who knows exactly what to look for we look for a specific product sometimes it to be a feature based query it could be it could be based on you know the quantity let's say 500 ml wine or cabernet etc and and also a lot of natural language that we started seeing off lately especially you because consumers are so years to searching on google and amazon and and that's kind of increasing more and more as you know with with some of the other ecommerce sites as well and so so.
rep,from a relevancy standpoint we took a look at your side so let me just make sure i make this slightly bigger so you can see this as well .
rep,yes here's an instance where again now these search queries are you know not necessarily you know how not necessarily resonates to how shoppers would come and look into your site but we've just put together a few examples as to what the possibilities are and and where the opportunity lies exactly right.
rep,so so so we'll just an instance where we looked at alabama whiskey for instance and you know we only got one relevant results where the other two wasn't relevant and you know we were and went through your navigation instead then we see that you know there was a couple more of alabama whiskeys available on you catalog
rep,and similarly we looked for hendrick's gin a specific products here and we forget out that both the results that showed up not hendrick's gin but you have hendrick's gin clearly on the navigation .
rep,and you know so so right before you know i'm going through this just in just a quick question how important is site search for or b21 do you have a lot of users coming in and using the search functionality or is that very minimal.
prospect,yeah i think it's very important this was something every one it is problematic so but the business thing too is that when this when this field of this website was done and it hasn't been done since 2011 so it's been quite a while since it's been revisited the site was really focus around the category of wine only so spirits and and even beer for that matter our categories that have been added in the last really in the last two to three readers and so so if this site was not designed for it yet the inventory is there that made sense so that's kind of a sticking point where you get a lot of unrelated or you don't even have the ability to leave some categories out of your searches so so yeah it's important to us i mean we recognize it as a priority for sure yeah.
rep,okay and and you know just out of curiosity so let's assume you know you figure out that somebody on you let you look at your analytics and figure out that there was a search query on the top where a lot of people are looking for the query but your site is not showing relevant results what are the typical work flow today to kind of address that is it a manual process that is that you know and easy enough forever.
prospect,no it's not an easy fix for us really at all because there's it's not a it's not really something that we can at this point do anything about actually so because it's a really old program you know that the search is based off of now so .
prospect,there's no there's really no tools related to search at this point i mean the left navigation that you mentioned here which is giving me better results is is better but in terms of keyword is just doing searches it's not you know we certainly can't rank results or you know create synonyms that we see coming up regularly i mean there's no tools around that currently.
rep,okay okay gotcha and typically when we you know some of the retailers that we work with we see that search conversions are normally three times more likely to convert as in people that search or three times more likely to convert and people who don't is that something that you notice as well where you see a higher conversion from search versus you navigation.
prospect,that we don't know says the searches so you know you can get results that may you know may not be relevant in fact most of the time you you would get something if they not feel it unless hey you know how to smell is exactly like anybody fall here hendrick's you know not simply not having the apostrophe and earth hendrick's grows results and don't make any sense right so so at this point it's hard for us to tell i mean we can we can definitely pull up our analytics and see if that's if that's the case but.
rep,right and it's the only reason.
prospect,why i kind of order.
rep,correct right you know the only reason i bring that up is because clearly if you let's say you pull all the analytics and you see that your search conversions are not at least 2x  3x and it compares to your overall conversions then that's definite opportunity even in terms of maximizing that potential from a revenue standpoint itself.
rep,and yeah yes i'm moving on we tried you know a feature type query here again it's pretty generic we tried a 500ml wine but the wines that showed up were clearly not not the 500ml bottles i think the chair of 1.
rep,5 and you clearly have bottles that are you know back for 500 ml similarly corona six-pack or 6 pk and we gotten relevant results here so so the other piece importantly was the auto suggests today we noticed that on your site you don't really have you know in auto suggest or auto complete and and do you think do you think of it as a useful functionality.
prospect,yes particularly in wine or there's so many things that are spelled you know i'm usually.
rep,precisely so i like to kind of show you some examples from some of our customers now i know these are totally different verticals you know from the wine industry but the idea of showing you some of these examples are just to kind of show you what it's possible and and the level of customization that we were able to kind of build in for use that ways you know we kind of tailor this experience to the experience you want to deliver for your shoppers .
rep,right so let's say i'm expresscom which is one of our customers and what we build without the damage let's say if i type in jeans on a desktop we know that g you know the jeans is again a generic term and we know that jeans jeans is available for man it's available for women there are different styles etc.
rep,so we both are you know and all to suggest for them one which is very visual in nature where you see you know so we clearly know that people are a lot more engaged with with images versus just just just having textual formats and so we built out in a visual format especially in a paralyzed you know we see this a lot where people a lot more engaged when they see visuals if the product they are looking for and you know after going over over you see that we have categories making it easier for the customer to filter down to what they looking for so let's say i'm looking to jean for women i could go here jeans for men it filters down and then you have some of the popular fittings or the styles that's available on the site and and.
rep,this is from a machine learning standpoint so we look at click-through rate we identify what is being sold or bought them most and we kind of put this and put this on the top just because we figure out that blimp ferris it's mostly button in the geo that you're coming from so that's the personalization aspect to this as well.
rep,and similarly you know as you scroll down you have other options as well so this is for express.
rep,we have similarly you know so big basket as a grocery retailer they're one of the largest ii grocers and southeast asia
rep,and what we did for them is so we noticed that people coming on to a grocery site typically have you know have repeat orders as in you know normally they come in weekly or monthly basis and it's to restock up their their grocery correct and i'm not sure if it's you know similar on your site you know maybe somebody looking to buy wine typically buy the same kind of wine at every purchase i don't know if that's a lot in your case but here's an instance where let's say i type in bread on there or to suggest peace what it does is it if it adds all the components that's needed to go straight to the cart if i'm i'm a consumer that buys brown bread typically i would see brown bread on the top so that's the second personalization aspect to it and i can add brown bread you know change quantity here and add it to the cart right from from the search bar itself.
rep,so without really having to go through the categories and yes the typically what we noticed was it took them about 60 clicks in order to you know complete a purchase just because they're buying so many different products from a grocery standpoint so we wanted to kind of simplify that experience and provide a add to cart options right from search and and this led to you know a significant increase in their revenue as well and.
rep,similarly here's a retailer ss396 it's auto parts so the auto suggests we built for them is you get to filter down to what what car type you have that same looking for chevy and if i'm let's say i type in m which could be a multitude of different things but it shows me suggestions and what i could possibly be looking for for that specific model type .
rep,and i'll say if i was to do mirror for instance let's see if it yes it shows me all the mirror parts that are available for for the specific car type and i know some of this is not really relevant to your vertical but you know so i'm just showing you this just because you know we build ourselves to match the customer experience that you want to have for your customers right so similarly for yeah this was a bigcommerce customer i was talking about so let's say i type ni said again they have a visual autosuggest giving you different categories where it could be nike it could be night vision it could be a brand call 9 line apparel and and then you know the visual auto suggest images step that would help guide the shopper.
rep,so that's from an auto suggest standpoint now moving back to ces where we left off one second yeah the second piece again is from a synonyms and stemming standpoint so here here's an example where we try it out a russian royal stout and you know it typically could be a synonym for russian imperial stout where we had i think one relevant result the other one was not so relevant and similarly when you go down from from a stems perspective we audited with new york drink maybe somebody looking for a drink from specific location and results that showed i've had nothing to do with new york and you had new york's new york wines available from the <>.
rep,and i chose an example where we did a typo we misspelled about alcohol and yeah and clearly the site came back with zero results and just show you a couple of examples of stemmed words i was actually looking at you site right before i jumped on this call so light i'm looking for you know i suppose that a lot of consumers would come in and look for you know specific brand let's hundred pipers and here's an example where a type of hundred pipers without the space in there and it shows me zero results so .
prospect,alright .
rep,so should this yes this kind of indicates that you know there's a lot of times that you know if you look at your analytics again you should ideally see a lot of people abandoning search or or after they come in and search for a particular product assuming that your site does not really have you know hard liquor or or you know maybe it's just just a wine site and they don't have hundreds pipers etc.
rep,and and so that's you know the overall gist if you know the customer experience study other commerce search study that we put together for b21 and and similarly we were kind of tested all of the instances out for a mobile and we got similar results so. let me ask you this do you have a lot of users coming in on mobile as well or is that not so much?
prospect,we do i mean most people are converting on desktop still but we do have an increasing number of people viewing a lot more views than conversions which of course the new the new site address that but i don't know if it's because the site is not you know optimized for mobile where it's because you know with mine a lot of people do significant research in terms of selecting you know a wine so.
rep,okay oh yeah you know one of the things that we've seen with customers again is you see that especially in mobile pre people prefer to use search versus navigation in most instances just because it's a lot easier to search for a particular product and and you know like you rightly mentioned you know a lot of consumers don't be you know the same conversion rate and mobile as much as they do in desktop and that's possibly because mobile is still still remains as a research medium right so they come in look for the product see if you have it on the site and then maybe when they when they find some time to get to a desktop with the varieties and then purchase the product in that way.
rep,so mobile you know the search aspect and mobile is critical especially if you have more and more users even if let's say the traffic and mobile is increasing and if you not seeing conversions and one is we see that a lot of people research in mobiles its importance to have you know a significant and optimized search experience and and similarly that there's also potential to convert and mobile if you're able to quickly guide them through the product that they're looking for .
prospect,right yeah just got look it's not loading up here though.
rep,are you trying to yeah at launching our mobile in search.
prospect,no i was just looking to see what the what the amount of traffic is it comes from mobile so more than half of the traffic is mobile at this point so i mean that's for the last well i guess that's for the last week let me just look at like look march of this year versus last year .
rep,okay well that's that's a good number actually yeah so it's important is that
prospect,i mean the traffic on our site is up think if i can't wait like 46 percent enough in march of this year versus march of last year but the percentage of mobile is actually a smaller percentage so it's down 5% you know as a big-picture terms of the number of as a percentage of the entire i you know so.
rep,okay so you're saying it's so sorry i i think i didn't catch that so were you saying that the traffic is increasing or is it going down from the traffic.
prospect,okay okay gotcha that helps and you know now so i also wanted to take you know a few minutes to kind of walk you through you know how unbxd is able to solve some of these challenges that that we kind of called out both from a relevancy stand point how we address spell check how we address synonyms and stemmed words that kind of things that ways you have a better understanding of the technology itself in how we we are able to solve for some of those.
rep,okay okay gotcha that helps and you know now so i also wanted to take you know a few minutes to kind of walk you through you know how unbxd is able to solve some of these challenges that that we kind of called out both from a relevancy stand point how we address spell check how we address synonyms and stemmed words that kind of things that ways you have a better understanding of the technology itself in how we we are able to solve for some of those.
rep,so you know and you mentioned earlier on the call you you're evaluating a few search vendors i know you said sli is one of them and the other one i think you mentioned was searchspring and and most search vendors that you speak with you know just just from you know different shaders standpoint with tech ideally do a text pattern match from first for a query and what i mean by that is .
rep,so let's say you know so this is an e-commerce context example again but let's say if somebody would search for a women's white jeans the tech doesn't match with essentially you know do an anding or an or-ing which means it would either be a women's and white and jeans or women's or white or jeans and what happens in this process of doing a text pattern matches while you know there could be a few products you know which is women white jeans it does show a lot of irrelevant products along with the right products let's say you know you'd see a lot of white tops women's white tops while you search for women's white jeans and just and that's essentially because they're doing an exact text pattern matching now with unbxd what we do is so i don't know if you've heard of the tf-idf algorithm and you know that's that's the algorithm study even google uses but you know but what we figured out is that while your algorithm itself is really strong but it's essentially made for document search and not from any e-commerce context standpoint.
rep,so what we did was we kind of added another layer on top of the tf-idf algorithm which is called a relevancy gain which essentially let me let me go it's that's cranials will essentially adds another weight-age or assigned to certain weighted to each of that product so if you see typically on a search vendor using a tf-idf algorithm the highest weight-age is for womens then is for white and then it's with jeans and we know that you know somebody looking for women's white jeans the first thing is you want to show the relevant product which is the jeans so we assign the second weighted to it where we assign highest rated genes so that ways we exclude all of the non relevant products which are women's in white and so once we've got the product jeans we also understand that the attributes of the consumer is looking for is women's in white and and we were able to you know assign appropriate adjust to it and enter relevant results so that's essentially have we solved for relevancy and like most other search vendors .
prospect,right
rep,and the second piece too so it is also the user behavior so from a user behavior standpoint what we do is we also assess you know you product click troughs your add t carts we kind of assess what product is selling the most what what what what are people searching for and and buying and that kind of stuff and essentially our machine learning algorithm is also able to prior prioritize in and and show up top the results that are most popular based on some of these attributes. so that's the second part of it from from a machine learning and user behavior standpoint .
rep,right and and the third piece is you know also you know i don't know a if you merchandise for products today especially if you like boost a certain certain type of wine or a certain type of liquor based on you know maybe it's a campaign that you're running from a marketing standpoint or if or if it's just been an inventory for so long and you trying to clear without and you do that particular product unbxd the algorithm is built in such a way where we normalize that boosting so typically let's say if you were to boost a particular sandal and you sign the vantage by 10 points you would have you know this particular wedge or sandal show up on every single query that the consumer search for just because it's got such a high vantage of about 12 points .
rep,but with unbxd right what we were able to do is we're able to marginalize it and only show the product when somebody is looking for heels or wedges the sandals etc and not show for someone that's looking for a different product entirely.
rep,thats what the merchandising in boosting standpoint .
rep,and that's it from from a spell check you know i like to also stir you some examples of the spell shake so what we do from a spell check standpoint again it's we're our technology understand again the shopper intent and it's able to correct up to three misspelled queries so let's say here i type in vlc k j oh that's a l-e-t-h-e-j-k-t so here's an instance where i type in all of the three words and i've misspelled all of the three words and well our our system identifies all of the three misspelled words and is able to show the relevant results right from the word though .
rep,similarly for stemmed word so let's say somebody looking for t-shirts can look for t-shirts as t so let's say search for tees here and it shows me 556 results for tees now the intent of the shopper does not change if somebody was looking for t-shirts for its and we're able to show back relevant results the same exact 556 results for t-shirts as well so this is how we solve for four stemmed words as well so most of this is done out of the box wherein we've indexed our catalogue again you know millions of sorry go ahead.
prospect,in that example is able to understand me your phone just started cutting out.
rep,sorry will i'm not sure where i lost here will be on the t-shirt and tees that what you're referring to.
prospect,yeah let me i'm going to something something has occurred of my phone i'm gonna call back in here i'm not sure what what occurred.
rep,okay so i'll be online .
prospect,let me call back and i'm not sure but how do i get the numbers it in this screen somewhere.
rep,yes it's on the meeting invites video or i can send it over to you.
prospect,okay if you leave that there i am all right back then not sure what happened okay sure sure thanks.
prospect,okay we just welcome back you hear me all right now yeah that's much better i was asking what there's a person in it so you can put in t and then t-shirt is that the synonym process is that going through machine language learning as well or is this being done like manual focus based on the industry.
rep,so it's a couple of things that one is we maintain a synonym corpus of over five million words we've kind of scraped multiple catalogs we've kind of gone through wikipedia so just to understand the lingo and in the kind of synonyms that people use from an e-commerce context and the second piece is also from a machine learning standpoint so let's say working with so many retailers nothing in the fashion space if somebody were to look for t's and t-shirts the machine understands that somebody looking for t's is again looking and if somebody were just happen t-shirts it means the exact same thing so our machine is also trained looking at the trend that we've seen with with having worked with customer so it's it's dual in both ways.
rep,right just you know so yeah i'm thinking of her stemmed or a synonym word on your site we wine winery whiskies card showing replaceable terms where people could you know come in and look for for specific whiskey and and say and mention it scoach well if we know that that's typically what people are looking for we were able to show back relevant result again on that.
prospect,right okay .
rep,and so that's from you know synonym and and spell check standpoint the second piece that we also like to kind of walk you through is a product recommendations piece so this is again something that i think would be a value especially because in the wine business you want you know somebody looking for let's say a cabernet wine on your site you want to be able to show other cabernets let me see what the experience is like today.
rep,here's an example. you do product recommendations today at all justin.
prospect,we do yeah they've been suspended on the site during the time of this conversion because the data structure is actually changing every day as we go through this process to re-structure for the the actual attributes at each school level to normally they would be exempt of the detail page there but they're they're not displaying between now and the time of the new site.
rep,okay and do you use any specific logic.
prospect,it's only face off of purchase history so it's not you know categorically related necessarily or a lot of times you'll see something it's kind of odd that's basically one customer bought this they bought this way though it may recommend it you know.
rep,okay okay got it so yeah we at unbxd have pretty much all of the you know the product recommendation tools or widgets that's available on amazon amazon.com today so we have viewed also viewed bought also bought so so let me just take you to that slide from a one-to-one personalization standpoint so maybe you have some more context.
rep,it's a huge presentation i haven't gone through it enough time so i need to find out where that's latest sorry i'm just trying to see.
prospect,i mean for us or for our industry so the ones that are that are most relevant are really a category or the type level so what people also pop is kind of interesting but somebody who does it pretty well is winecom as an example sometimes you go to sku level you know there's they'll make recommendations that are based off of either geographically where they're from or you know the type and then maybe you know mess however puns but but they're actually relevant to some of the items that you're looking at in some way you know so.
rep,sure so you know so yes i from from that standpoint i think we cover that entire piece so so from a recommendation standpoint what we do is one we were able to recommend products basis if the popularity two we also use the collaborative filtering now this could be you know filter basis like you said somebody coming in from a specific geo somebody coming in from a specific device type etc and we were able to show back you know were able to recommend products based on that information .
rep,and three it also be your catalog based let's say you know like like like like the example i was on let's say somebody looking for a cabernet you'd want to share more cabernets that that's available in your catalog showing similar products from the same brand etc.
rep,and and the last piece is from a one-to-one personalization standpoint we also you know track digital footprints of shoppers and we track breadcrumbs and are able to essentially you know also show relevant products to you know what they may have looked for let's say somebody came onto your site selected a couple of filters look for a specific wine but then left and when they come back again we're able to kind of recognize that at the same shopper and show relevant results around that piece as well.
rep,so yeah so these are these are the widgets that's primarily available so from a one-to-one personalization standpoint we have to recommend it for you and recently viewed so that's that's - that's possible for somebody who's come left left a digital footprint in and we were able to track that and be able to do a one-to-one personalization if not for somebody that we don't have a lot of information on we use wisdom of the crowd where we also look at you know like like you mentioned viewed also viewed bought also bought we have some of the top sellers we have a widget for a category top seller so let's say it's somebody looking for a hundred pipers we want to show a top top seller 100 pipers and and lastly from a catalog standpoint we also look at cart recommendation let's say somebody put something into the cart you want to recommend more like these or or complete the look i mean the complete look might not necessarily be very relevant in the wine space but but yeah maybe i don't know if somebody you realize that somebody about three wines and there's a fourth one that typically consumers buy as well you want it kind of that that or recommend that product as well.
rep,yes but that's from the personalization standpoint and the last piece to it is merchandising i think this is really where you know something again where we kind of differentiate again most of our competition where we give merchandise is to control to to make the necessary changes.
rep,so question for you justin to do you any merchandising team today do you promote products do you boost products what's the most alike for some of those things when you want to promote.
prospect,yah we do so our marketing team from outsider i mean we send a lot of emails out as well so those items get prioritized and be in the site currently so it's it's several hundred items maybe put six the catalog of items is about 1000 so it's relatively small when we feed information to google we do bid adjustments based on profit margins and things like that so it's functionality that we don't have currently but something that we would be interested in to on this on the site as well so.
rep,perfect so yes so one of the ability that we provide from merchandising standpoint as we give you a merchandising workbench which gives you know controls to your merchandisers to make any of those changes that's needed on a real-time basis let's say sorry someone had to boost a specific products they were able to boost it depending on you know whatever the logic is so we give you that manual controls a while machine learning is able to recommend a few products from you know from what we've seen as tre frondm user behavior we also give you the control to prioritize certain products that you want out of an inventory or basically promote products with higher margins etc so that's controlled ever and it provides you as well.
rep,and i yeah i don't i don't know ashish you still on the line.
rep,yes justin yeah ashish do you mind sharing with justin the merchandising dash board just to that justin as you know some idea of how it looks and work flow and so on.
rep,just give me a moment.
rep,sure thanks.
rep,i just want to make sure justin you get a good sense of what the dashboard looks like as well that ways you know what it is about ashish let me know when you're ready now make you the presenter.
rep,justin you be able to see my screen now.
prospect,yes .
rep,okay awesome so justin this is how our dashboard looks like this is try me where you will have the control to kind of make changes or i would say over write the the technology or the unbxd logic to give you a very high level understanding this is the homepage where you get a good understand and in terms of your overall performance what kind of search query traffic you're getting what are the views add to cart what's your total revenue revenue from search revenue per search visit or per search query a very high-level understanding in terms of how you're doing for this particular week month of the year right .
rep,then what we have is a merchandising dashboard now here within the merchandising dashboard what you can do is you can set query rules category rules or site rules right a site rule is primarily something that applies to your complete site any logic that applies to all your search queries right so just to give an example say i always want to promote my home brand i want to always demote products which are out of inventory right.
rep,always promote high margin products i always demote accessories maybe say so any any such logic that you would want to run across or across your search queries you can do those here and i'll show you separately in terms of how you get on these rules so let me take an example of a query rule right so say address right again you can define whether you want to and then in this new dashboard what we are doing is we are calling them as campaigns instead of rules i would say because you can also define the time period for how long you want to set these rules right so say for red dress i want to run this for a month so that you don't have to worry about coming in and maybe say editing or deleting this particular rule it's kind of automatically taken care of then you will have a choice who's whether you want to run this rule just for desktop just for mobile or for both desktop and mobile.
rep,address and i can set this from interest again i can choose crossfade desktop tablet mobile across devices be clear annually april 21st may second on desktop next right now we have i would say we start with merchandising just give me a moment something that i'm doing wrong here today.
rep,justin while we're waiting on ashish to kind of figure out that piece i just have a question for you now you know i know so you're actively looking for a search vendor and you know there's a question around what are some of the important things that you're looking to address you know what what are you expectations from this vendor.
prospect,well it's most the things that we've covered so for us it's it's a function of relevant results i mean initially would be right out of the gate because that would be an improvement over what we are we have right so from their facets being relatable to keyword searches and really merchandising is as important so being able to prioritize those results either specific to the customer or face off of relatable to keyword searches and really merchandising is as important so being able to prioritize those results either specific to the customer or face off of rules that we we've put into place so for us to you know automation is very important to us because we're growing for the last three or four years we've grown every year by 40 to 50 percent and so you know we have a lot of a lot of demands of our team the facility demands a particular we'll be moving to a new facility.
prospect,next year so we have a lot going on and so automation is also you know very important as well so.
rep,well nice congratulations on the growth as far.
prospect,yes thank you.
rep,and yeah so so from a product standpoint you know i know our solution you know can address most of the pieces that you mentioned and also the ones that we kind of spoke about in terms of relevancy in terms of stemmed words etc and and it's just because you know how we were able to do it is we were able to you know understand the shopper intents we're more ecommerce context aware and we were able to address that piece and and and and the second aspect to it is again the merchandising dashboard i think you know i'm not sure ashish is able to get back to what he was.
rep,<> let's try dress and the reason i was not able to see anything there is because we don't have anything as dress one in the catalog and when i do dress out this is how the site looks like right so if i was to go onto the site and try dress right you'll see the first rule black dress.
rep,hey ashish sorry look i don't know if it's just me or we're not able to see a screen.
rep,oopz.
rep,the one that you share yeah.
rep,are you able to see now ?
prospect,yeah there we go.
rep,yeah so when i start merchandising like this is exactly what you see on the site today and i search for say dress like the first two black dress into a little dressed you see that a pic of your site on about on the back and merchandising dash board and this is the 90% experience that we deliver right this is based on geo this is based on relevancy user behavior machine learning all taken taken into picture and and it start showing most relevant results that would convert right.
rep,but then still your merchandisers might want to come in control some of these elements based on inventory based on margins male based on brands based on any promotions and if it's a start merchandising now you can start running various different rules so say i can come in and say boost and then you can boost based on any particular i would say attribute of a product right so say if i was to say title contains i see it so everything that has neck in the title is now boosted up right you can then sort you can slot and i'll show you what the slot is so say for a particular range from position i would say.
rep,ashish sorry again i don't see a screen moving his bother changes.
rep,any yeah.
rep,all right .
prospect,i just tried to reload
rep,there could be the internet that loading up slow.
prospect,i still see the same screen with the search results.
rep,do you see the first dress is the ribbed dress the ribbed lace lace of mock mock 59.9.
rep,yeah that's the screen we're on.
rep,yeah so this is different from what we started with now you see all the other.
rep,we're we're looking at the keyhole site cut out fit-and-flare dress up top the first one.
rep,that's the first one let me stop and start sharing .
rep,yeah i don't see anything change yes and now see the change.
rep,right so i tried to slot at position two and three so what we are trying to do here is it's slotting as a functionality is so say for a position right which could be any anywhere right in the in the search results page you can come in and say for position two and three i want a product which has a particular attribute which would be a brand again be a category could be something in the title or description and here you will see these two products are now slattern now every time someone looks for a dress though the other products might change these two products are going to remain here now even if say the the second one the ribbed lace-up mock goes out of inventory it will be replaced by the next popular product that has maybe say lace in title right.
rep,then you can also do a product level placement which is pinning which is specifically coming and saying irrespectively of how someone searches i want these products at a particular location right so i can say i want this blue dress on on the on position one red dress on say position four right now i have and then this red dress on position five you see you see that changing and now if i was to do that on the side here yes i think i have to this first.
prospect,i mean yeah for us i don't see is doing so much annual merchandising such as this just because in an apparel or something where there's 500 skus you know that's that makes maybe more sense but for us i mean there's so many different skus we would maybe categorically through things so for example we have items that category called top recommendations you know those may be prioritized in more of an automated function and it's possible that we make in something but it would be the other thing two is that for our industry that this skus are changing so quickly so and every vintage is considered a new skus so we have a wine and every year it changes so it's you know it's fairly common.
rep,i completely understand so at times say for a very dynamic catalog you might want to come in and say that promote my new arrivals right.
rep,right say in a particular category of vines someone looking for cabernet you always promote your new arrivals right maybe the top four products are always new arrivals right the only thing you need to make sure is that you tag a new arrivals somewhere in your product catalog feed are say the arrival date and that you arrival can be any product that is that has been launched or added to the catalog in last 15 days or 30 days need to show up in the top top four results correct.
rep,right and for that particular category are relevant to that particular source right so there can be various different levels of controls depending on again industry and how you would want to start boosting these products but then the idea is starting from a category level to the product level right we give you complete control to come in and start merchandising.
rep,apart from that what you will also have is the backend to create synonyms again we handle all synonyms and stemmed words i would say 90% and above synonyms and stem goes on any site automatically but then there could be at times a very specific industry jargons give you an example for one of our customer from the weightlifting world in their word shoes are called lifters now there is no way we would know that shoes are called lifters in a particular industry and also it wouldn't make sense for us to add that into our universal corpus because lifters might mean something else in a different industry altogether .
rep,so in these corner cases we give you the ability to come in and start adding these synonyms you can also add a csv or an or an excel file but otherwise it is very simple any merchandiser can can just come in here say keyword shoes choose it to be a unidirectional or a bi-directional keyword lifters update right so create that's how simple it is to create a synonym .
rep,and then what we have is a detailed reporting that that we provide you which is which is granular to two levels one is per query report and two is per product report right sorry this is a very again a very high-level overview in terms of your search performance your top search query is zero result query stop click products or top ordered products for that matter right an executive level reporting is what i would call then we have a query level reporting which will give you all your queries and and the performance of individual queries its ctrs clicks carts orders or add to cart and and this can be for a particular period of time you can look at last one week one month or one year data you can also come up this report now if i was to look at this particular record this gives me a trend off of this particular query but how does this query has been performing a graphical presentation of this particular query and it also gives us the products link to this query which products show up and what are the clicks carts and orders for each of these cards right so say if there is a product now here is a product which is which is not ordered very often you the merchandisers might want to go back to the merchandising dashboard and then start merchandising this query and maybe bring this product down the order so some of those very fine controls that you can do looking at these detailed reports any questions.
rep,and then this is more and more of technical stuff in terms of very our api keys are some configurations with some we control in terms of what searchable and not searchable and then user control you can have multiple users accessing this dashboard and different levels of i would say control as well maybe read only are read and write both
prospect,alright okay so most people getting the data to you via the api or they using feeds to get you the information so there's a person green who is something related to the you know how have frequently the information in that.
rep,correct so you can you can you can share the feed in three ways one an api and shared ftp location and obviously we would be bigcommerce and that see what we have is a plugin so if we would come and put a plug in to the bigcommerce platform and whatever feed you are sending to netsuite that being your back-end we can immediately pick it up from there.
rep,so you don't have to worry about the feed being in a in a unbxd readable format we take care of that right and we can pull up pull out the feed to an api to the plug-in on worst case scenario we have a shell ftp location where you can push the feed and we get a clean up from them.
rep,and just one thing that we didn't get to cover early i know we are the one thing that we didn't speak about it you know the poc model that we have for all of our customers so what unbxd does is we give you a peek we let out a poc for about sixty to ninety days where you get to try out the solution and within that 60 to 90 days we make sure that you know we contractually guarantee an increase in your search conversions and that's something that that that we guarantee so we guarantee you can increase in search conversions by five to ten percent of the poc period you see the increase you continue with us on a long-term contract you don't see the increase you're free to walk away i just wanted to throw that out there as well just because you're evaluating some of the other vendors as well .
rep,and if you know so if you kind of i don't know if you have any of these stats availability you're able to share some of these stats in terms of your site search visits or conversion rate etc what i can do for you is i also put together an roi model so typically telling you how much money you know unbxd can make you at even at a 5% increase which we guarantee and and basis of that we price a solution so yeah a pricing is totally roi driven making sure that you know we charge you and we are making money only if you're making five to ten times more money than what you're paying us.
prospect,right okay yeah we have some of this information on site visits conversion rate average order value revenue month.
rep,do you have it right now .
rep,do you have it handy with you right now.
prospect,oh no not right now but it is we have you know it in our reporting tools.
rep,okay okay well that helped though so yeah we can move as fast as you want you know if at all you think that you know the migration process is taking too long and if by any chance you know technology projects they get delayed for any reason we can we can always start you know we have a very simple way of implementing unbxd you know even on your current infrastructure using ajax model yeah yeah just saying we can implement it as soon as we can't even on your current infrastructure just in case you like to get things up and running do the poc see the value in you know maybe once you see the value you more comfortable moving with unbxd once once you reach platform as well so we're okay doing it both ways.
rep,well the idea is nothing that we do see on your old site right given we are starting it on in august in new siteand still do the poc on the old site and which is a which is a good 90 120 days off period for us to implement and for me to test for the for the 30 to 60 days period and then make a decision whether this is a this is a technology want to continue with on your new site and for any reason if you don't like us and you know that on the new site you might want to go with someone else or you might want to continue with us so that's that's very typical admin model for customers who are in a in a platform change phase i would say.
prospect,right okay all right.
rep,but so justin help me out here would you stay other good next steps for me .
rep,or yeah so i think you know what i don't know what the process is if you like you know we're happy to kind of schedule in more details techno you know tech deep dive into some of the aspects just in case if your tech team wants to learn a little bit about the implementation so we have a couple of different ways that we could implement our solution you know the for the poc we typically recommend an ajax model where but it's really simple you know you just render the header and footer and we render the results in between and in that ways it's a lot less effort in your end and we do most of the conflicts and our side and to get you up and running and and post that if you see the value you want to do a long term we can do it you know more detailed implementation so we're happy to schedule that call and yeah so you know once if you could send over the details and happy to put some pricing for you and put together some pricing and also the roi that that we spoke about that ways you know how much money we'd make you.
prospect,okay yeah we do have a instituting of ajax that's really simple on our end we do have a developer on our staff as well so .
rep,okay great and if at all i mean i you know so if you know if you're okay with it we'd like to jump on a call maybe walk you through the roi and the pricing as well and in that way so you have a good understanding versus just looking at it from from an email standpoint.
prospect,right yeah that would be referred.
rep,great justin thanks so much for taking the time again it was good talking to you and we look up to the opportunity again thank you.
prospect,all right thanks bye.
rep,thank you bye now.
rep,sorry i was running a few minutes late sorry to keep you waiting but i introduce myself my name is ashish i primarily manage smb sales at unbxd and thank you for giving us the opportunity to walk you through our research and target tool on call today.
rep,so julie before i start sharing my screen i do have a presentation that i prepared for you with few examples very specific to your site and i'll walk you through that but before i do that wanted to kind of quickly understand learning more about the company there's always something unique about every e-commerce website so this can help you understand a little more about tahariasl why people buy from you and if there is anything in specific that you are looking to solve on product discovery or site search today so that we can focus more on those areas doing a discussion.
prospect,the site's relatively new it's only been live for a year the e-commerce business is new it's only been live for a year so the company for 20 years was primarily wholesale and we opened up the b2c channel by opening up the e-commerce website a year ago we started with no customer file no email list really but a lot of brand equity.
prospect,so all of our products have been sold in every retailer that's there for 20 years so customers knew our brand so we have through seo sem ppc retargeting display that's really how we've grown the business in the last year and continue to plan on continuing in that direction.
rep,got it so you do not own any stores of yours right you sell in other's stores right.
prospect,no no tahariasl is a wholesale and b2c e-commerce business only.
rep,also curious what is the e-commerce platform that you use today and what do you use for.
prospect,web link.
rep,what's that web link.
prospect,web link yeah w e b l i n c.
rep,okay awesome and do you use something for site search or is it more of a platform default functionality that you use.
prospect,i do not have an internal site search other than what's in the platform i don't i haven't integrated with somebody like an sli.
rep,okay awesome great sounds good have you worked with sli in the past or did you evaluate <> okay.
rep,great sounds good let me know once you can see the screen.
rep,so i have a very on high level three things that that i wanted to talk on the call today a talk a little about who we are b i've done some research on your site try to identify few areas of opportunity where we can come and help you improve the product discovery on your site and lastly if there's something that you like and we can discuss the next steps implementation roi pricing and may be things like that but during the course of the discussion if you have any questions feel free to stop me and i'll be more than happy to answer those questions hope that works for you.
rep,great so to talk about us we are a 6 year old company headquartered in mountain view with offices in sunnyvale and chicago and back an engineering office in india bangalore as well we work with over 1200 sites globally 120 plus customers right here in the us.
rep,we serve over 1 point 5 billion search interactions a month to give reference.
rep,this is larger than the top three e-commerce retailer put together in the country.
rep,from your space some of the some of the fashion brands that we work with primarily are express rue21 right some of the large ones we do work with some of the mid-segment customers as us patriot tactical burks outlet which i will say this southeastern part of the country again so the other organizations that we work with is hh gregg fresh direct fresh direct is a large grocery retailer  and the northeastern part of the country ashley furniture home store one of the largest online furniture store out there.
rep,from a platform perspective we are a platform agnostic solution you can integrate into any e-commerce platform of yours it really does not restrict how efficiently you use unbxd so whether you're on the weblinc today or you need to decide to change that from in future you don't have to worry about continue with unbxd because <we work on all platforms across>.
rep,any questions.
prospect,no not so far.
rep,so i'm sure you understand the importance of search but one of the things that i wanted to highlight on this slide was that one of the researcher by jupiter says 80% of your visitors will abandon a site after a poor search experience and the reason is they are so habitual of searching products on google or amazon finding the right set of products that they expect all e-commerce site also to behave in the similar way and hence if you are not able to show them the right products for a search query they would just believe that you don't carry it and then they will just ignore or again slide back to google or maybe a competitor.
rep,here is a quote i wanted to quote here from express ceo david he actually quoted us during the q2 earning call at wall street finally because of the increase in conversion that we could bring in within the 90 days of going live and these conversions were obviously in double digits for him two quote us during during the on his call.
rep,here are some numbers from from our customers across platforms or competitions that we are working with you will see the the increases are anywhere from say eleven twelve percent to up to 60 percent higher in terms of conversion and revenue as well our increasing conversions average is approximately 24 to 25% across all our customers within three to six months and within three months we proved ourselves with a minimum of 10% increase in their conversion <>.
rep,here are some things before and after unbxd on express before unbxd someone looking for blue jeans on express would start showing you lot of different blue products they are products made of jeans but not the actual blue jeans and the reason we were able to deliver this results because of three pieces of solutions which i'll also talk in the rest of our conversation but then on high level machine learning personalization and contextual search that helped us deliver an increase in the revenue by almost 60% within the first 90 days of going live any questions before i move on to the examples on the site today.
prospect,no i'm with you so far.
rep,awesome great once you looked at on your site on high level our auto suggest auto correction the contextual relevancy search ui merchandising and infrastructure and i'll take few examples from each of these and show you the the areas of opportunities for you to <> the site search<>.
rep,the first thing i looked at at was autosuggest on the site it's good that you have visually i would say auto suggest starts showing the  images of the products which is really <> but when at times <most of these images were not relevant so if you if you see dress dress for i'm typing dress you still have dress here one top you might want to skip that not just that but say why do we have these dresses here are these your most popular dresses among the tacky that's that's a question.
rep,and also i see that you want to promote some of your content which is which is good but then again this is something much consistent across yeah i try to search for red you'll notice some of these are not red these are white/black these few products which i searched where i try to search for suits the auto suggest for the first product that i actually see the jacket dress not an actual suit suit as such.
rep,you could you have various different category you have a skirt suit you have a say a pant suit you can start guiding the customers to the right category and see the idea is at times a misguided auto suggest can be more danger than not having one now i'll show you few examples let's <> how do we approach our to suggest for some of our customers.
prospect,i lost i lost the screen shot.
rep,now.
rep,yeah i'll just get this.
rep,okay now.
rep,so i'll show you few of the auto suggests across the verticals for you to understand how we come in and solve challenges for auto suggests <> vac parts this is how their site used to look like until we came they used to have two different search boxes one to search for parts one to search <brand and models>.
rep,we came in we said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so you know you are now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right parts search what if they choose the wrong search and also at the back end you have to optimized two different search box.
rep,so what we did for them is something like this the moment i start typing in this cell it starts showing these parts for the left hand side models on the right hand side and top searches us patriot tactical apparel a thirty five million dollar company they sell military apparel to citizen but them as a products site brand is more important and some of the categories are more important. the moment i start typing in ni it starts showing me nike the most popular brand on the site some of the categories of nike it show some of the similar brands like nite ize night vision nine line apparel showing some of their categories within these top queries starting with ni and some of the popular products not just that say the black boots here the fourth black boot became more popular this week and this boot will come on top and others will come down. express as a brand for them category and some of the subcategories or say some of the popular products within these categories are important for them i think this is much more closer to your site the moment i start typing in jeans starts guiding me to jeans within each of these categories in men in women in slim in blue in gray and it started showing me some of the popular products within each of these categories. may be this week the gray jeans is more popular or the merchandisers decides to promote gray jeans for a particular period i know during christmas the red jeans was more popular and it used to show the red jeans it starts showing that. then jeans and women jeans  some of the other categories or query which are popular within jeans will start showing up and then the last thing is big basket dot com on big basket dot com they had two challenges they are i would say the second largest grocery retailer in apac for them they had they had multiple visitor or say i would say visitors buy multiple products in each grocer they would buy like <> every time they would transact <> products it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search for the product go to the product page add to  cart and then check out instead what we did is something like this the moment i'd start typing in chi it start showing some of the popular options with the chili chicken the price the quantity the delivery options allows me to increase the quantity and add to the cart right here from the search box. some of the commonly search terms for chi from the popular brand and categories and also starts putting up a banner here for you to start i would say promoting the products for a particular search not just that because they have repeat visitors that we also added personalization meaning if i was buying chili more often on the site i start seeing chili on top but if you go buying chicken skinless more often you would start seeing chicken skinless on top this helped them reduce their clicks almost 30% from from 80 clicks to now they are somewhere around say i would say 20 25 clicks per transaction and each of these case you would notice every customer of ours had a different challenge that they wanted to solve and different customer behavior on the site<> and how customers buying today on the site.
rep,and we were able to understand that that's the first thing we do <> site and start building this piece very specific to each of our e-commerce site.
rep,any questions before i move on.
rep,does this make sense you like it not like it so far.
prospect,it yes it makes sense and yes i get it but our customer really doesn't use search much and i think it's because our product assortment i they don't have so many products on the site that she can't find what she's looking for and use a search so where i think if our if we had more styles and she was frustrated in trying to find what she was looking for by just browsing she would use search more but she likes to shop. my time on site is about 6 minutes and my pages per visit is approx of 6 to 7 so she's a she's a browser she likes to shop and look as opposed to knowing specifically what she's looking for come search add it and buy.
rep,got it completely makes sense so also i'm curious do you have statistics in terms of what percentage of the traffic is doing search.
prospect,i'm sorry i didn't understand your question.
rep,do you do you have metrics site metrics on how many total sessions you have versus how many search sessions you have what's the percentage of search on your site.
prospect,i know sessions from google analytics i'm not sure how to find site sessions i mean search session let me go to the search console.
rep,if you have that turned on google analytics where you can look at i think under behavior on the left hand side behavior and overview site search and overview yes the title and that kind of session trying to understand what percentage of your traffic typically does search.
prospect,let's see.
rep,and the reason i might look at addresses.
prospect,just got this here and five percent.
rep,five percent.
prospect,yeah five point five four percent of your visit that's used site search and that's for the last quarter.
prospect,she doesn't use search she shot she just browses.
rep,i get that because that's that's you know a behavior that's kind of different from some of our <>.
prospect,i really agree and i think it's it's the customers that i've seen here are different their their behavior is different than customers i've seen on other sites and other places i've worked and i think it's because we have new collections that come out every month i have new assortments that come out every month and she wants to see the new stuff it's not like she knows she's looking for a red dress so she's gonna come on she's gonna search for a red dress she's gonna only look at the red dresses buy it and move on. she shops she browses other she goes through our categories she looks at our new stuff she's a window shopper i mean my conversions great don't get me wrong but she she's a window shopper she wants to scroll through and see what the assortment is as supposed to just searching buying leaving.
prospect,that's why i mean i was astounded when i saw our time on site and pages per visit stats they're significantly higher than any other apparel site that i've worked on and yes the 5% is very low for search she's shopping just not just searching and buying.
rep,absolutely and what's your what's your total pageviews like on an average in a month a hundred thousand pageviews half a million pageviews what's what's the number like.
prospect,let me find that.
rep,the ballpark number will be fine and i think for some of our customers like rue21 they got the search is very high and the reason could be they have a huge catalog what's what's your product catalog size like how many products do you have.
prospect,we have about total number of styles not skus because each style has ten skus total number of styles on the site is about 1500.
rep,because on rue21 we feel almost and <approx of> say 30% of search traffic and you won't believe and <approx of> 40% of the traffic actually comes from mobile so when we engaged they wanted very specific things that we could do for them or visitors for mobile because the mobile traffic is growing really vast they have very young shoppers <>.
prospect,the young shoppers will absolutely shop on mobile more than i'm about 60 68 % desktop because what i'm finding is she'll get an email for me she'll look at it on her phone and then she'll complete the she'll go back to the email again on her desktop or her tablet at home and then complete the purchase on tablet or desktop i have have an older demographic.
rep,i get that because we so that kind of opens up an area of opportunities all around the recommendations and that's why i wanted to understand before i could talk about it in terms of what's your traffic level right what's your total sessions or maybe your pageviews today on a monthly basis i could walk you through a few other things that we also do <> julie you with me.
prospect,yes i am.
rep,were you able to see the numbers the total pageviews.
prospect,actually i'm looking for.
rep,okay alright.
prospect,behavior total page views for january 2017 so far is 679 thousand and unique pageviews is 500000.
rep,okay 679000 <chocolate> i would say around 250 thousand page views a month this is a decent traffic now what i was wanted to understand was that you here's what i see on your site.
prospect,i'm sorry i didn't understand that can you say that again i didn't hear you.
rep,do you see my screen.
prospect,okay you will also love how do you power the speed it's driven from the algorithm on the site it's not a it's not an integrated recommendations engine it's just what the site does based on where she's clicked on through the site already.
rep,okay but is this something which is built in the weblinc is it something that your team built internally or <>.
prospect,it's part of the weblinc platform.
rep,weblinc platform okay got it sounds good because what we also have right apart from search what we also do today is the recommendation piece so would you be interested to look at the other features on search if <>.
prospect,no i get the search piece but recommendations don't make sense for us if a customer is buying dresses for me to recommend other dresses i can use what comes with the site because i can see the category if she's buying suits. same thing i can see the category from our separates so we have jackets tops pants and skirts i would prefer to complete the look but i don't have enough of a product assortment to give her a relevant experience for completing the look and i don't have shoes accessories or handbags so from where we are with what we have the assortment it doesn't make sense to integrate with a recommendation dungeon.
rep,okay no i completely understand that i was about to talk regarding one of our very best widget for e-commerce site like yours and that's called complete the look <> or buy the look wherein it's almost a very little effort from your merchandising team we can power that automatically in a <platform> that we can also power ten different other widgets to climb the upsell or cross-sell across the sites starting from the homepage to product page add to cart or in check out page you can place the widget anywhere on the site so that's one piece.
rep,site search coming back onto the site search wanted to understand given the traffic is it something that you see could be the work to look at i have few more examples from the site but given given your traffic and i'm still to understand this could be on priority within the next 90 days julie and i'm curious just you would be just look at the other examples on site search.
prospect,you're curious to see if if i want to see more examples on site search is that what you said.
prospect,i don't need to see more examples because based on only five percent of our customers using site search i don't think like i don't have a lot of i don't have 404 pages i mean part of is the site's very clean because it's still very new so i don't think i don't think it's worthy extra expense right now.
rep,okay cool i get that i can maybe what in that case what i can do is i can i can send you this ppt you can have a look like it includes some of the screenshots from your site that shows where you might want to look at maybe basic something could be from there spellcheck perspectives from stemming perspective or even say colour synonyms perspective some of the things which are very specific on a site <> at times people people might come in search for something very specific that's in their minded you might not carry so again important to understanding that show that to the customer.
rep,but again yes again the question here would still remain whether whether there is something you want to solve on priority even the traffic and given usage of site search on the site but i can share this with you after this call but <other immigration> because because on my agenda was to to demo our search solution the the product recommendation and the back end merchandise dashboards to control few of the elements on site search and product discovery.
prospect,no because you're in your search examples you have size and color we allow people to filter by size and color and she does use those filters a lot so if you go to one our pages like if you go to dresses and filter by right so she can filter by size filter by color or and the filter by category is more for if she's in if more if she's in sale cuz in our sales section that's where i combined the suit separates and dresses but i applied it to all but if she's in dresses she can filter by her size filter by her color and i think she's using that as opposed to search.
rep,i got that so julie one of the things again to understand is for some of these each categories right different filters might be important say for tops maybe material would be important for dresses could be say fit could be important right and that's where we also not only power these filters but we also make them make them dynamic meaning you can have specific filters for specific category for pants you can have specific filters for shoes you can have different set of filters depending on what is important for that particular category right.
prospect,right and mine and the site the weblinc platform works that way i create i can change the filters by category based on the metadata that's in it loaded for each product.
rep,okay got it because ok so right now you're not set it in that way because right now when i do it is it <was attention to> irrespective of what i search for.
prospect,but if i filter by size it will only show sizes for the products that are in that category.
rep,yeah yeah i agree that's when is filter by size but say for dresses maybe that is another attribute on the product which is material i'm just just making the stuff but maybe you have another attribute there which is important for dresses which could be material or which could be the fit type so what if you were to add those filters or to ensure that for your search results and purchase processes the start seeing filters which are very specific to dresses versus say for shoes they start seeing filters which are very specific to shoes and you can also have set up filters now here i know that you had skirts with like.
prospect,we have skirt suits and pant suits.
rep,pant suits now within the skirt suits i was i wanted to look for a single button suits if that is a criteria a single button double button suits and if i wanted to be now filter this just all your single button skirts how do you how do you power.
prospect,but here customers doesn't shop that way she doesn't she's not as concerned about that level of detail she likes because i when i was started to analyze purchasing behavior and what she's purchasing there's really no pattern to what she's purchasing it's she cuz in one month she may only buy you know based on what we're offering her in that month collection. and i think because we put out new products every month she gravitates towards those very quickly so it's not like she shops for one button blazers or two button blazers or military-style blazers it's just the overall aesthetic of what she likes it's a unique anomaly to this how she shops this brand.
rep,okay i think yes given that experience i buy that right the way people are buying on your site today is really different.
prospect,it's it's very different and and and i don't have any long-term history to see if it's if the pattern is an anomaly or if that's really how she shops because we just went live a year ago our products have been for 20 years on macy's and lord and taylor and everybody else but how who the direct customer is i don't have a lot of data on.
prospect,so i've really been watching her behavior and how she interacts with our site with our products and it's different than any other brand i've ever worked with and i've worked with many so i don't know if it's just because it's so new and that's why she's window shopping so much so if is the behavior gonna change six months from now when i have more products on the site but there's a lot of turnover so it's it's rare that i have products that live on the site more than a couple of months.
rep,okay make sense no i will go by that and and that's that brings in another thought in my mind i'm just curious if you have any a/b testing tools that you use today.
prospect,weblinc has a/b testing tools but because my traffic is as low as it's been and i don't have a tremendous amount of customers i haven't implemented that yet but i plan to by the end of this year.
rep,okay also i know that optimizely or say i think monetary we do give up a one month free trial that you can actually do a free trial of our site search to use it a lot some of our customers when they're not sure if they would want to improvise on the search or not right what they do is they try us for 30 60 days understand their need by themselves and then make a longer-term decision.
rep,and that's why our engagement is also kind of very i would say in the initial phase it's very flexible we start with a 60 90 days poc wherein we come in we do the complete implementation and give 30 to 60 days for the customer to start testing unbxd start seeing by themselves two things one the users of searches with that goes high and two conversions on search if that goes high.
rep,at time it also happens say if i know that search usually doesn't work that way on the site i'll end up navigating right like on amazon i can blindly believe on search i know if i was i was not able to find by search i would not probably i'll probably not try and navigate through the site because i'm very confident about their search and that's what subconsciously also happens with some of the consumers on particular sites.
rep,so this way you could test if the traffic the first user is going high and two you can also if you have an a/b testing tool what you can do is you can split the traffic by 50-50 you can say 50% on unbxd 50% on you default platform and you can see it by yourself whether this increases your conversion and it really doesn't make sense for business to continue spend in a solution like this you can always walk out there is no long-term commitment during that poc period.
prospect,yep i think we need some more because i also need to remove seasonality out of the equation because the site launched february 2016 but we weren't live within google until may so it kind of in my eyes were not quite at our one-year mark and i want to be able to look at what sold by to see if there's any seasonality to it as well. so i mean all of these tools are great i think for a more mature more a site that's got more data and more issues i really don't have anything any problems i want to solve because we're still very much in the learning phase of understanding how she's shopping what types of products she's buying and still trying to understand her behavior.
prospect,i think that's a great idea yeah.
rep,what we are launching now is a new navigation search which is going to be a really dynamic navigation the idea is on very high level right if you have 10000 visitors on the site the 10000 visitor should see 10000 different way of a category pages or your browse pages right based on their segments from geo what geo location they're coming from what device type they are coming from their history on the site right their behavior in out there in the social media may be say right so some of their social persona we try and collect that information.
rep,and then start serving dynamic browse page right for each of your visitor and that's something that that's due to be out next 60 days and then that might be a future for such high browsing on the site that your pageviews will be high and people are navigating more verses searching the products that could add a lot more onto the site basically keep the people on the site for even longer <>.
rep,sure sound good.
prospect,okay thank you very much bye bye.
rep,hey david how are you doing.
prospect,great how are you.
rep,absolutely fine sir thank you so much for taking time to get on this call.
prospect,yeah yeah my pleasure i'm curious to to learn a little bit more.
rep,david just a quick question just a quick question so we were talking but i mean whatever my name is shattered actually i work with rohit i work here primarily as a product adviser primarily working with retailers talking product discovery and how was that unbxd can actually help you in resolving most of these queries so i was also referring to your email where you spoke about one of your sites is already using shopify and in turn using unbxd and site that you're referring to the other site is not on magento or your trying to move your current site in magento.
prospect,no so there's two two urls one is officers only comm that one is on shopify and it's going to stay on shopify and that's where we're already using them the unbxd features and then the other url is bob barker.com which is our parent company that's the one that's on magento and we don't have any plans to move it from magento so basically two two sides two platforms yeah.
rep,okay i get that i was just for those curious to understand how these things are okay wonderful .
rep,yeah and in terms of bob barker an officers only are both b2b sites or do you have a mixture of b2b and b2c .
rep,yes so officers onlycom is we've we relaunched it basically last week as a as a b2c it had been kind of a hybrid kind of a thing that was kind of to be honest it was a little kind of a mess and so we've the we've kind of moved that too we have move that so strictly b2c and others our other side our bob walker side is almost entirely b2g with some b2b so it really functions more as you know that our our customers on the bob barker site are primarily correctional facilities jails prisons rehab centers you know those types of things and and so we do have some some private companies companies that that privately run prisons and those those would be b2b everything else is pretty much b2g.
prospect,so there's some some twists in terms in there in terms of procurement practices and whatnot but um.
rep,totally understand that.
prospect,so yes it's a bit of a bit of a hybrid.
rep,i get that. okay that's that's pretty interesting and the for the officers on this site how long have you been using unbxd now.
prospect,well we've been familiar with it nowhere of it for a couple of months but we've we literally just launched the site last week so.
prospect,i mean not not even enough and we haven't even started our marketing blitz yet we're sort of in still in the soft roll out phase so we don't even have and i don't even have i don't have metrics i don't have anything yet.
rep,all right i totally understand that.
rep,and while we're talking i just want to also quickly check if you can also see my screen currently.
rep,okay okay so just want to also make you aware so there are two kinds of products we have one is the entire self-serve option which comes with shopify which is our more of a teaser introductory version of our actual enterprise product our enterprise products is a fully automated machine learning solution that we actually have a i'll call it a platform right so what i wanted to do today is am or wanted to give you a quick introduction on who we are and how our machine learning product works probably a quick teaser and then also talk to you about magento integration because you didn't mentioned that you want to understand how does it work on a platform like magento so that i could probably <> i do understand you say you had a shortage of time so i will keep the call chart but we can obviously follow up and see if there's follow-up conversations that we can do it any poc .
prospect,okay yeah that all sounds great that sounds great .
rep,okay awesome so this is essentially a brief agenda i had today we can essentially cover the first three aspects of the agenda and then probably talk more in our follow-up call and discuss next steps right so you know this is primarily for our enterprise product so essentially we powered about 1200 global sites these are all the enterprise sites and shopify along with power about 3500 sites but this is on our basic piece of ocean right.
rep,and we work with customers and almost every vertical including the b2b and b2g like one of the customers that you would see here ib supply they have b2g and b2c sorry b2g and b2b as well they primarily sell to the.
prospect,im sorry im sorry who's that you said.
rep,ib supply.
prospect,ib.
rep,yeah ib supply it's industries for the blind it's a milwaukee-based.
rep,so they roughly do about .
prospect,they might be they might be one of our customers believe it or not.
rep,okay awesome awesome that's nice enough yeah so they actually have a fairly large catalogue getting the overall number of skus close to 400000 they have more than 8000 filters they do about 50 million orders in online revenue new york and and they have fairly complex rule sets that we cater to they have a specific set of skus which can only be available to say an army is only available to navy only will able to air forc only available to a specific set of these private customers that they work with so you essentially have to do sku segmentation by login and so on and so forth so they're like a whole sort of fancy rules in there but yeah we work with a bunch of them we work with fluid container which is also some amount of b2g and b2b and yeah bunch of customers in that sort .
rep,and then the good thing about a product is you could be on a magento you could be a shopify shopify plus if you wanna upgrade some or things like atg ibm lifts your or it could be a completely native custom dotnet platform the solution was extremely seamlessly
rep,and this is a cloud solution it's it's on amazon web services but it's most of our customers we also can create a virtual private cloud and you're very concerned security we can also create a virtual private cloud which gives you the best of both worlds both the hybrid world of owning your own datacenter and owning your own servers versus also getting all the flexibility that you get on the cloud so we'd also could do that.
rep,so this is again a very very high-level overview of what we do right .
rep,and and for us as a company right if you look at our entire approach we started off as a company started solving search related problems there was some crazy things started coming up three four years from now their people had a catalogue that would change every 15 minutes every 20 minutes especially in marketplaces where the inventory keeps changing .
rep,and so people wanted features like a dynamic catalogue upload people hired we work with auctioning sites like liquidation channel which essentially were price changes every second right so they had dynamic pricing challenges and all these things the search solutions started becoming very very complicated okay and search as a product probably two years ago three years ago would have never fallen into the top three priorities of any tech or any e-commerce business manager.
rep,but today it's worth at one of the top three priorities primarily because people are seeing 20-30 percent of their business come through search and generally what has been seen as the conversion rate and search is much much more higher than the conversion rate of regular site right of a regular search page so that is where we've seen that search is taken importance and one of the few things that we've done differently is that we all of those search providers who will actually guarantee you a conversion rate uptick once you implement the solution so that you actually see a direct impact on your bottom right if your search conversion rate today is say 2%.
rep,for example and we'll come in and tell you you implement a solution and within the first 90 days you will see a 10% uptick on search conversions or at least be 2.2% so if you're making say even five million dollars per year to search we'd at least increase it by five point five million right so that way for whatever investment you make towards unbxd you actually see a very definitive out away impact so that is something that we do and that is one is a lot more businesses in the last few years and today we've expanded our solutions could be on search we do the entire product discovery we also do product recommendation we do category navigation for large retailers like express or rue21 we also help them do campaign management and so on so we covered the entire gamut of product discovery in whole right .
rep,and why should you choose unbxd and i'll take you to a quick brief about all of them apart for building a great technology i think one of the key differentiator you would see as our solution is also extremely customizable to very specific needs like you have like i spoke about ib supply right well there are some very very specific needs on b2g and we have customized a solution for that right and i'm not sure merchandising how important will it be for you but if you are a retailer where merchandising controls become important we have given a very easy-to-use merchandising platform which makes it very simple for you to use it and then on mobile this once you implement a solution it will also make we have standard sdk is available for ios and android so if you want the solution to work on on mobile as mobile search it works seamlessly as well.
rep,and and then we have performance guarantees in terms of response times in terms of availability in and most importantly also give you an sla for conversion rate update so that you see a direct impact on your bottom line that essentially these are specific reasons as to why you should only consider the solution like unbxd right .
rep,and then and finally just wanted to show you some very high-level business benefits you could look at any vertical you could look at any search technology that you could be using natively and what we've replaced in terms of an e-commerce platform two things you would definitely see is one is the conversion rate increase and one is the revenue increase and across customer basis this is something that you've always a very high level over review of what we do any questions so far on this.
prospect,no although hang tight on that one slide for one second i just work for quick change okay okay interesting thank you.
rep,no problem and what i also want to do is probably spend a few minutes giving you some very common use cases that we've actually seen and solved when it comes to sites such that would be relevant to you right what we do is when we talk about site search right our product discovery is a whole we look at all the elements of the customer's journey on your site right starting with auto suggest the first time and he comes and starts typing something on the search box what is that he or she sees and what is that we could actually do very differently but i went onto your site and looked at how auto suggests options work right i tried i typing in coffee maker or a try typing in table and you get a laundry list of everything that's available doing a very very simple it expecting match right it's though it's giving me a lot of options it's essentially not guiding me in in any sense nor is it giving me any visual representation right.
rep,this is where we believe as one of the first impressions that you want to create on your site you could do things very different to it just to show an example next this is something that we've done in express right .
rep,a you have a scope where it actually shows you category navigation of you know looking for a specific product what category that product or actually belongs into and then it also goes into some specific subcategory section ii can show you that two or three quick examples to give you a perspective .
rep,this is like a parts warehouse site that we power there again based in the midwest the primary cell parts before they came to us they actually had two different search boxes because their customer behavior was either they have customers who come in search by an exact part number or there are customers who come in search by say a model name right so they thought having two different of search boxes will actually solve the problem but it actually amplified the problem because you have to manage two different search experiences now . so what we did is you can just pick the first in here right so if you start typing in the biss one side you would see parts one side you would see model names and then we also given them a widget which shows all the tops of which is starting with b is s right we'll build something very custom while if you go to say us patriots they have an interesting business where they actually said military apparel to normal personnel and for them they wanted a guided navigation scope that  being offered to a customer and also show visual representation of their top-selling products right for them if i say and i wear i'm probably as a user looking at nike we've given them a scope where we show nike as a brand and all the top categories with nike it's are being sold in the last seven days and also exposed to what else is available in the inventory give them like a visual tour of all the popular products on the site and also show them all the top queries available. again something built very very custom for them right if go to somebody can ib supply industry for blind that you talking to you about why this l'hotel also showing you another one in just grassley in velocity the example is uniquely pissed people had about 14-15 products in a transaction might be same in your case where people buy more product in a single transaction here they wanted an option where people can add products to cart in the fastest possible manner.
rep,big basket is one of the largest ice in southeast asia here the way we categorise autosuggest for them is as a user if i start typing and chicken right i have an option to change quantity and add products right from the search box .
rep,right so if you look at these examples what we've done is basically built in experience which is very very custom to specifically tailor write and not go the very standard template ice kind of an approach and then this is again about stop talking about auto suggest .
rep,but then a few things that i noticed in your site is if i go and misspell any of the words right it could be a single word or it could be a double word essentially it will take you to no result section and the only way you could solve it today is essentially start manually building in a synonym list right for any kind of that is being made and it could it's also applicable for even stemmed words right you'll have to do the same thing.
rep,the way that is where our machine learning system comes into the picture where you can misspell a word say black leather jacket misspelled completely it like a misspelled black misspelled leather i can misspell jacket the system automatically corrects it to black leather jacket and starts displaying results from the word go.
rep,so that as a retailer you don't have to spend time and manually building all these synonym list either first and the words of a spelling mistakes.
rep,and the way we've trained our  system is it can actually auto correct up to six words in a single long search phrase so that as somebody who leads it you don't have to spend resources and time keep looking at zero results zero results that you get and keep adding those things manually right.
rep,and even stemming right these are some common use cases we see for stemming wait flashlight flashlight just a single space at work like work lights or cell phone smartphone mobile phone the results it's a very very different right but with unbxd like if you go to express there and look at spelling t-shirt in all these four to four different ways then number of results you would see is very very consistent.
rep,and this like saves a lot of effort for you at a bottom in this curious to know so bob for bob bob bob barker how many skus we're talking about what's your catelogue size.
prospect,well it sort of depends on how you define it i it's i don't even know if i know right offhand it's a something like ninety percent of our sales or on i don't know couple of thousand sku or a couple of thousand products and then there's miss size size ranges and stuff like that but i can get those i can get that information.
rep,yeah even if it is safe for three to four thousand products you're still talking about multiple permutations of combinations of how people could spell it right and and that's where you could come in and help you of not having to maintain this at the our end or do it manually.
rep,so it so that is again from an entire error correction in error detection thing like so if you look at our search component at a high level there are three major problems that we solved.
rep,one is on the experience but which i showed you an auto suggests right two different ways of how you can actually make sure that your first experience you user gets on your site is extremely custom right the second is the entire error detection and error correction which today is done manually we can offload completely all of that to be done in an automated fashion .
rep,and the third key component is relevancy right people could come and try and find products in your sites and in various different ways right one of the first few things that we actually did i'm not sure if you've heard about this there's actually a white paper also written on similar french right .
rep,so when we tried building our search system what we did is we essentially tried finding how people actually search for products online like.
rep,the more research we did we figured that there were essentially 12 broad ways how people look for information online right they'll either go to a site like if it's a catalogue site they'll go and search been exact product name it could be like five word product name or they might go and do a specific sku search right or they might go to an apparel site and search by a specific theme like a cocktail dress or a formal trouser right all of their very new to your site or if they don't exactly know what they want they might use natural language like say shoes under $20 or black dress on sale or black t-shirt or a v-neck t-shirt or a crew-cut t-shirt at things like that right.
rep,and and if you look at google today more than 80% of search searches that happens on google today is all natural language searches right .
rep,so how do you solve for all these different kinds of search queries so what we have done this is a foundation to our system we've built algorithms which can automatically resolve for each of these kinds of queries so our relevancy tuning is is extremely <> i can give you some three four quick use cases to be they must leave that right .
rep,when it comes to say a product type surface right i will be looking for a mobile charging cable right this is essentially you can solve for it by at what is present on the title right we can actually go a step further where you can start to searching on what is there on the tittle what is the there in the product description also what is there in the reviews if you have actually user-generated content and then pull out most relevant skus or products that has to match to a specific query .
rep,and then we consult for natural language like i could use some unique search is like a black dress on sale or a full sleeve office wear for women we still find the right set of products without you having to do anything and still show the right results to our user .
rep,or you might be looking for product pages like one of the common issues that you've seen is like i could be as a user looking for a toyota heated mirror in the title it might still show heated but in the description in the pdp pages can actually be non heated and it still comes up because the search solution is not looking at pdp pages right but with unbxd if you look for a passenger mirror so you'll actually find the passenger mirror irrespective where it's actually a person of a sight.
rep,and then if you have to do sku search 90% of the sku searches are actually solved with the auto suggests itself like you don't have to type the entire sku as in when you start typing the sku the machine learning understands what the intent could be and starts also populating it .
rep,and even with a half spelled sku will give you a full set aside as well .
rep,so these are some very specific unique things that we've actually solved for retailers across and another of these you have to actually do it manually it actually starts out happening automatically honestly.
rep,any questions on this so far .
prospect,you said none of those require any kind of manual starter it just it starts to you know it automatically begins learning once you sort of turn it on and it starts you know i think that the data that users are interacting with.
rep,correct okay and the way wendo doesn't actually even jump start a system like generally our implementation cycle is about four to six weeks depending on complexities of integration right and when we start the integration actually enable analytics at your end so that in the first 30 days itself the system starts to understand how products are being bought on the site .
rep,so that the day you go live the system is already are there right .
rep,and then for any unique skus you keep adding it generally takes about a few days for the systemto learn.
rep,you can either jump start the system by adding a synonym if at all you want to do it or you can just leave the system to learn itself like the system learns it so well that give you an example like if you have to if you have filters on your site right safe somebody comes in looks for shoes and some of the filters you show for shoes is say size and ankle length and width in fabric type and so on and so forth right .
rep,so after a few days you if size is the most clicked filter what the unbxd system does is that filter automatically moves up top you don't have to go and change anything manually .
rep,like say example right so i could i could have men casual shoes or shoes as a vertical or casual shoes as a sub vertical where i define that these are the set of attributes that i want to define for this specific subcategory right a will give you an option to define them right and b once you define them as a user i can come and search for men casual shoes men formal shoes i did i need not even have to have the word shoes on it would be men's nike men's  adidas the results will show in the same order of attribution and then after the few days we figure if width is the most clicked attribute weight to the automatically move up top front you don't have to do anything manually right .
rep,and we also do a few cool things like detecting colours right i'm not sure how relevant it could be on your site but i look for on your site event and look for a black t-shirt right there is one black t-shirt that it shows but it also shows other colours right but if if you had to get a little more complicated and it's have to search for a crimson t-shirt right you might not have crimson on your inventory but the system understands that crimson is in the red family so that at least so a red colour to user and not showing a blue or black which is fully relevant to what i'm looking for it also does that so that it's very easy for you to start showing the most relevant results are not so something which is not relevant for easy right.
rep,and then ultimately.
prospect,you know the on the color i'm sorry on the color synonyms does it does it'll learn that automatically we've to set that up.
rep,no now initially when you what all your send us is the catalog feed and everything else we done it by yourself.
prospect,gotcha.
rep,right can then finally on zero result pages right there might be instances where somebody might misspelled the word so badly that no matter what kind of machine learning you have you still will probably not return a relevant result right .
rep,in such cases instead of showing the users a blank screen with nothing to do we essentially take the users to a screen like this where they're actually called to action where something it gives an option for user to either move forward or move back and continue with some experience rather than staying at a blank page with sorry message right.
rep,and again these can be fully customised depending on either like in your case since it's b2g if they're a returning user and if there is history of that user we can pick up things that they generally buy and show them which is most relevant for them right.
rep,or we can also start picking up things within the same session as to what are the different kinds of products i've actually seen in the existing session and also show them that and these are some things that we could do and we can also if you want us to we can store references for up to a year if there are people who come onto your site only probably two or three times in a year with a specific login we can actually store what they previously bought and what they're most likely to buy and start populating results according.
rep,yes okay at a very very high level this is essentially what our product look like.
rep,we manage experiences with different   options for auto suggest we completely automated automate error correction and spell checks and synonyms and then machine learning takes care of the core relevancy cases right it could be any kind of type of query that a that a or a product that a person might be looking at we end up showing him or her the most relevant set of results and we can again fully customize it depending on the kind of business you are in it could be b2g or a b2c or a b2b we can customize this completely field so again this one will give you a quick flavor of how this works .
rep,another thing i was also quickly take you through how we can actually do it on magento with magento it's very simple because we actually have a plug-in available there are essentially three modes of implementation we do right one is called as a hosted approach right where essentially we are hosting and rendering the search results like if you have bob barkercom and if you have a sub domain for search called search.bobbob barker.com search dot bobbarker.com is completely powered by unbxd right it's a traditional way of doing things that impact your seo we personally don't recommend it but for smaller sites are good sites where you don't want to manage or you don't want to have the headache of running search you can completely offload that to us right .
rep,that is one approach the other two approaches are most standard one is called as an ajax approach we generally use it for a poc because when every single customer we sign up we essentially do a first 90 day poc where the first four weeks we come implement the solution and since you don't know the value of the solution you don't want to invest a lot of yard time and you are a source of strength so all we asked you is just give us a header footer and an empty div tag that is all you need we need from your side we will build all the logic on our head and whenever user searches for some we are essentially doing the html injection right.
rep,so there's like literally mild development effort that is required from your team we build all the logic on our end we put this on a staging environment so that you can go and test it for any kind of corner cases and then once you go live essentially when the page loads the header is you arch the footers yachts are the framework as yours and then the results displayed is coming through unbxd.
rep,so it's a very easy way to actually test the solution that's called the ajax approach right and then there is the api.
prospect,i'm sorry that you said it's called the what approach.
rep,the ajax a-j-a-x.
prospect,ajax like yeah okay all right okay.
rep,if you look at express right so i can go look at say jeans so.
rep,i am working on a hotel today the internet collection is a little patchy sorry about that.
rep,so then this actually is the page is loading you're seeing the header and then seeing the photo right this is essentially what the customer uses and they give us a empty dif tag and all these results for jeans is essentially being injected as a head stabled by unbxd .
rep,so this way you don't have to invest any time or resources we can do everything all we need is when we kick start the implementation we just one will have a discovery called we understand how people buy on your site we ask you for your read-only access for your analytics it would be ga or omniture or whatever analytics you use so that we can start jumb starting the system and introducing machine learning.
rep,and then we build all the spell check the relevancy algorithms at our back-end and after three weeks we essentially put everything on a staging environment you can come test it and then you can go live and then you use the solution for the next two months and if you see that 10% uptick in conversion you continue with us on a one-year contract if you don't see any conversion of triggers at 10% guarantee you just walk away no question asked.
rep,so that that reduces the for you of committing to a longer-term search solution and you can actually see the results for yourself for committing to along with the contract.
prospect,and in addition to the today is called that when the ajax approach the other two options that you mentioned that you said we'd really don't recommend i think were where you guys you guys host a dedicated server right that's one .
rep,that is one thing that we don't think yeah we don't recommend the third one we actually recommend that which is what a lot of people do is the api approach which is like a one diffusely mystery where we essentially have a plugin that is built for magento and we do a simple api integration right we don't recommend that early on because an api integration will require dev cycles on your site so we don't want you to do an api without being absolutely sure we recommend using the ajax go live with it do the poc after three months once you've seen the results of yourself then you can invest your developers time on actually doing an api integration .
rep,and i can obviously so that you get some perspective on how an api integration is done it's extremely salinas the step-by-step instructions available on how the api integration needs to happen and it's fairly standard and we have a bunch of sites in majento who actually use our api integration so it's it's fairly standard and common.
rep,so yeah that's essentially what we do i had i i knew that there was the interest of time so i just wanted to keep it short and give you just a high-level overview of how things work.
prospect,yeah okay so it's very helpful thank you so and in terms of the this is on the on the merchandising side you you mentioned that is typically handled by sort of the other in other words the piece the piece that we're using right on shopify the sort of i think you can refer to it as kind of the lower end product or the entry-level product is that right so is there is there integration between this between that and the and the search stuff that we've been talking about .
rep,yes there will be integration with that and this is like how the merchandising dashboard would look like if you took take the enterprise version this is the dashboard that you would actually see you can essentially if you have two sites in your case you can essentially manage both the sites or if you have any sub domains or different environments for staging tests and production you can essentially manage all these domains right here right and then depending on the catalogue you send us right you can send us the catalogue through xml csv or if you have done an api integration we can actually pull out your catalogue in real time and then depending on the fields you can we can make specific fields both for autocomplete and search searchable versus non searchable right and then this is essentially where you would go and program your facets you want to go and edit a facet if you drive or if you want to add a new facet and map it to an attribute you can actually do that here right .
rep,and then synonyms again just to repeat myself you don't have to go and create any synonyms the machine will learn by itself but if there is a new product that you introduce and on day one you want the system to work really well and you want to manually add a synonym because it's a new product and you believe that a lot of people will come and buy it we give you an option to add a synonyms and the finding unidirectional or bi-directional equivalent and this is very very optional you don't have to do that system will do itself right.
rep,and then the merchandising feature you were talking about you can go and merchandise the search you can also merchandise for all your category pages your product pages as well very easy to do search right like we've built a simple demo site right this is primarily built for apparel space.
rep,i will show it to you how it works so if i have to look for dressed as a fairy right i have about 216 dresses of my site and this is my popular query and i wanna merchandise that all i need to do is when simply create a rule right and then click on merchandise right once i click on merchandise the same product set you that you saw here is actually available for you to merchandise  right you can then filter them by any specific attribute or you can run any promotions where you can sort them boost the more sloshed them or you can create like a custom landing page or a banner i didn't run a campaign on them is where all the options are available and if you want to boost them it's very easy but you can either boost them by using these leavers all you can boost them by a specific random specific if i want boost them say by title right and title contains let me just choose something random yeah title contains a lisa i know might look for this a lisa products show up on top i can do a simple drag drop and pin products to a specific location like if there are specific brands you wanna promote a specific products you want to promote you can do that right you can print specific products or specific location or if there are too many products to spin it to pin you can just slot them like i can simply go and say positions 3 to position 5 i just pick that i want to sort them by brand say contains.
rep,three four five ralph lauren power it's not it like now i can go back to my site and just click on dress again these are the two products and these are the three ralph lauren products i got.
rep,and you can do this for search you can also do it for all your category pages and you can go and run campaigns and create specific category rules as well like you can go to a specific category called men right and go ahead define a custom landing page for men and then also define how fast it should appear for men so for men if price is the most important thing within this move price to the top it's very simple and that you can stay under the next filter you can make these specific changes and then depending on which is most popular they'll automatically keep moving up and down depending on the machine learning algorithm so then once you do what you don't have to keep following up on it would automatically actually .
prospect,okay and is the so and then there may be some information about this on your side i haven't looked too recently but in terms of how the listen well so let me ask first the merchandising piece that you just showed is that is that a separate product from the separate product offering from the search bit or how is that how are the solutions kind of broken out in terms of you know how you put them and like them or whatever yeah.
rep,yeah so actually wants to take the search product the merchandising comes automatically along with that.
rep,so it's actually built essentially a search probably enterprise search burprobablyer is talking to you about essentially is they be primarily break base it on the number of search sessions or the total sessions do you get every month like if you have a very high-level overview of how many searches you get per month like it could be fifty thousand one hundred thousand a month or ten thousand a month if you just give me a range i can tell you effectively how much it will cost your month and.
rep,and solution basically once you take the solution the merchandising comes automatically along with that.
prospect,okay got it so the enterprise the enterprise part is either it's based basically just on search sessions.
prospect,okay all right got it and.
rep,and you can essentially use the product for three months see if it actually makes that difference to you and if you don't like it in this cancel it there's no long term contract associated or nothing to hold you back for the longer term and if you don't like it and we guarantee you that conversion rate uptick.
prospect,got it okay alright so let's see in terms of so just to kind of give you an idea of so this is this call leads from my perspective it's kind of educational in the sense that we will probably not pull the trigger until the first of the year and you know so this is this is something we're looking at as a 2017 initiative but obviously something we would you know ideally there's you know there's lots of things that are competing for time but ideally something that we would get done sooner rather than later in the year.
prospect,so yeah it looks it looks very interesting there's a couple you know a couple other folks that we want to look at couple other solutions and really try to hone in on really what's best for us given you know like i said our customer bases is a little it's unique and our products are you know they're they're not they're not consumer products so so that we're we're always a little bit of we always have to try to figure out where we fit into different solutions so but but yeah this is very helpful and i think there are there's quite a few things here that i think we can can really use so yeah.
prospect,if you if you wouldn't mind sending that url you were talking about from the docs section that talked about the different integration approaches that would that would be helpful and i could probably find it but if you could send it would be great.
rep,i'll send that's not a problem.
prospect,well and then okay cool and then the other thing i probably should have clarified just right from the beginning but i would was we got going and i just didn't is you you were saying i'm sorry you were saying that your sharath and and and where is the guy that i was emailing with but your sharath right.
rep,my name is sharath yeah i work here as product specialist and go to the part of my sales team so .
prospect,okay all right just what it's helpful it's always helpful for me to kind of understand who's who here all right great so so yeah if if you'll send me that stuff and i'm going to go through this and talk to some folks here and like i said we just we just launched the other site last week so there's a lot a lot of cleanup and you know goobers to fix but we're pretty pretty slammed but but we this is something we're very interested in so i'm i'm gonna try and get back to you um you know pretty soon just to try to keep the conversation going folks here i have some some questions as well so .
rep,and as told you david uh you don't have to take like the ultimate decision do you actually see the value of the product like as i told you we can do an ajax implementation we not take any time i know you're you guys are in slam we don't will not take any time of your schedule we will build it for you we will put it up on staging you'll probably have to dedicate a day to just test it out with the flu test sequences and then you can take it live see the solution at work for like two months like we can make just as a rhetorical use case like we can get the solution up in december for you jan feb march you can actually test the solution see how it works for you and by end of march you can actually take a decision whether you want to more move ahead with us or you want to evaluate other people as well so that option is available and we can make that option being available for you as well .
prospect,okay all right great that's so good so yeah thank you for your time and thank you for the information and very helpful.
prospect,okay yeah yeah that sounds that sounds excellent i'll try to i'll try to get that together .
rep,no problem sir again thank you so much for your time wonderful talking to you and thank you for the.
prospect,great sounds good thanks a lot.
prospect,and i'm logged into the into your go-to meeting so ready to go.
rep,awesome do you see my screen right now.
rep,great so my name is sharath i technically head sales here for as it unbxd i we wanted to first thank you for giving us this time and what we wanted to do today was essentially give you a quick background on who we are what we do also understand from your perspective when when you we talk about product discovery is there any specific channel is that you face today anything that you think that you could be on the lookout for either building it in-house or trying to look for any external partners to help you with so that we get some context into it and then we've also done a quick commerce study a study that we do with every prospect that we work with the intent of this discovery call was to make sure that we look at if there's anything broken on the from a site search capability on the site today and see if there is any use cases for us to help you with so that you also get some background on how our solution could work so this was a high-level agenda for the call today.
rep,anything else that specifically you had in mind for the call.
prospect,no that's good and just so you guys know i'm not the decision-maker for internal search thats for product management team but i do i do my team does actually handle optimization of internal search so if things work out well and it looks you know looks like a solution that would be viable for us then i would pass it along to the right people to evaluate.
rep,absolutely we're happy to do that we in fact had a few conversations with some of the folks in the world walgreens team over the last two years especially when it comes to conferences there is somebody or the other from walgreens who we get to meet and there's been some discussions internally so at least i think the name might ring a bell with some folks internally of your team but what we wanted to do is take you through a slightly more detailed demo too just to give you some perspective of what we exactly do and and then how it will help right.
rep,and just also wanted to quickly understand from your perspective when you talk about optimization for site search are you specifically talking about personalization within site search segment and target within site search or site searches as a core relevancy element itself so is there a specific function that you manage.
prospect,the specific function is the data analysis of the terms so okay you know my team is i run the seo teams so what we do is we take our knowledge of understanding what the customer is trying to achieve via the search terms and then we work with the merchandisers and product management team by looking at each you know piece of data for the search terms and see in where we're not helping the customer meet those objectives it could be typos that are common and or it could be that there some things are searching for that are no longer available so we need to kind of redirect them to a destination where they can find an alternative product things like that.
rep,okay okay that makes a lot of sense.
rep,and i believe everything which is built is homegrown and custom built for walgreens right both your application as well as the search itself.
prospect,no we're on atg and we're run on elastic.
rep,oh elastic search okay okay that's good context great so.
prospect,to keep in mind one more thing i'm just gonna tell you just to help you with your sales process today today walgreens is running on elastic and then we just migrated away from endeca and so right now with the product management teams you know there's there's somewhat of a focus more on trying to get the fundamentals working correctly in elastic okay rather than looking at you know additional partners for you know improvement so that you know i think to get there and in the in the next couple of months where we'll get all the fundamentals cleaned up and then i'll start to be more open to looking at partners but today that's kind of where they're at is they are they are busy you know they're all completely focused and busy on trying to trying to solve for all the problems from the implementation so they're not real open right now to ideas about new products and services.
rep,totally understand that especially when you've got away from endeca moved over to something new i'm pretty sure would have been at least like a couple of months to year kind of a process to get this through so obviously we want to realize what's the best we could do with your with elastic search before you to get and get back to you so completely with you.
prospect,yeah i just want to be fair with you guys so you know that you know i definitely don't have any problem with propagating that the idea that it's a product that we should be looking into but i would expect i would expect kind of the sales process to be a little bit slower until they get this stuff cleaned up.
rep,no no absolutely no issues we just wanted you to spread the good words so that's that's the only agenda we had for this call.
rep,so before we get on to the stuff i would give you some background and i'm open for any questions you have and i want to make this a lot more interactive and keep it short and brisk for you to consume as much as you want and then we could also set up follow-up calls at a later stage to discuss further.
rep,so there's a quick background as a company i'm not sure if you've heard about us we are headquartered here in mountain view in california we've been around for about seven years now work with about 120 brands in the enterprise retail space we've seen a lot of initial success in the apparel and beauty space so we work with express we work with rue 21 we just started working with ann taylor and loft.
rep,we work with a bunch of other mid-sized retailers in the fashion beauty space including some of the cosmetic brands like deborah lippmann of bh cosmetics to name a few in the market place slash home improvement space we work with ashley they've been a customer long time now we <east> again and then we work with just started actually this week we started working with the home shopping network hsn and we also work with newegg out of la so these are fairly large retailers who have like huge number of skus like newegg has over 100 million bed bath has about 10 million skus and just to give you some context that we also manage scale and we also work with pure play electronic retailers like hh gregg we work with grocery retailer some somewhat closer to what walgreens sells i don't know walgreens is a super store but fresh direct has a whole lot of grocery themselves so we work with them and us auto in the auto space so one thing is the solution is fairly well proven across multiple verticals some of these customers have us only operations we also have a bunch of customers who have operations in multiple other countries so we can actually also manage a german site or french site a lot lot of latin dias languages and actually we managed from a capability perspective.
rep,and a from a platform standpoint most of the customers have actually migrated from endeca to us so they're all on atg they were using endeca in the past and precisely for probably one of the reasons why you guys move out of endeca because of lack of innovation after the oracle acquisition a lot of them were looking for moving out from endeca and they moved over to us but we also have customers who are on highbrow or on websphere and some of the mid-size retailers were in magento and demandware as well so that's a quick background on who we are.
rep,any questions so far yes.
prospect,no sounds good.
rep,so another reason why we believe when we talk about product discovery we address the entire gamut the first component that we built was site search and even today relevancy has always been our strongest in it and i'll take you through a few examples on what we mean when we talk about relevancy and we also today i have a comprehensive product recommendation product we also have a product that we help you power your category pages we've recently launched our personalization product which can actually do both one is to one personalization as well as segment and target and we have a merchandising dashboard a tool which is slightly similar to an endeca experience manager but it's more of a 20-17 solution so it's it's much more easier to use it's has a much more sleeker ui and a lot of segmentation capabilities that you would probably not find with endeca so essentially that's the whole gamut that we address right.
rep,but search is what we started with and we believe enterprise search is probably the most difficult problem to solve a because there is a lot more complexity and you've very little control on how an individual might look for the same product in in very very different ways so it's very difficult to build and manage it manually hence we actually ended up building an ai platform and today the ai platform has automated most of the manual functions that would happen while you manage any enterprise search functionality right starting with things like your spell checks your synonym detection different variances of relevancy including natural language which is probably one thing that we're really really good at we've essentially tried automating most of the experiences which was probably a challenge till now plus at the same time we've built this merchandising tool because your merchants know your business better than anybody else so we also wanted to give them all the flexibility to also run campaigns as well so that's the whole gamut we've built.
rep,and from a platform perspective this is a cloud solution we are on amazon web infrastructure with redundancy built on microsoft azure and we have a cdn front running our service so essentially we guarantee you a sub 300 millisecond response time we guarantee you five nines of availability and one of the things that we've also tried doing to differentiate ourselves because we understand like liking like how you explained right this means so much of internal investments that people have done on search and somebody comes up that we can also solve some of these problems there's always a lot of question mark and people are resistant to change.
rep,so what we've done is we've come up with a poc model we can actually do a quick test on the solution itself do an a/b test versus your existing infrastructure and in that poc period we guarantee you at least a ten percent lift in conversions versus your existing infrastructure so that if there is money on the table people are more open to have a conversation and move this forward so that is been our approach over all.
rep,any questions so far on this.
prospect,no makes sense.
rep,right and and the reason we talk about the whole conversion guarantee clause is primarily because we've seen the success across multiple verticals people and customers who are on different platforms who have different applications that they've inherited and when i talk about furniture home decor i'm referring to ashley this is express this is rue 21 this is us auto this is us patriot tactical or this is newagain this is parkeyes so across the board you would see two distinct things within the first 90 days of going live one is the change in conversions and then a corresponding revenue impact as well that's why we make it make sure we also put this as a clause in the contract so it's more easier to have a conversation with any business side from that perspective right.
rep,so this is a quick background on who we are so the second thing i wanted to talk about was the quick study that we did on walgreens site today right and when we talk and i'll share this report with you and when we talk about a commercial study what we've done is we've tried going through the entire experience of finding a product on wall walgreens dot com and when we talk about the entire experience we talk about the first interaction your customer would have with the search box which is the autofill functionality how is your error tolerance today how do you manage synonym detection today how you good on relevancy and how ready is the site for mobile or for search on mobile so we've gone through the entire five elements and we've given you specific snapshots that we found on the site today which we believe could be improved right.
rep,and before we get started right just to give you a quick background on how we've built this entire ai platform because everyone talks about machine learning and the ai and it's become more of a <had out> there so i just thought i'd throw some light as to how we were tried approaching it trying to sound more practical to you right.
rep,so one of the things that we did is while we were building this machine learning algorithm one of the first few things we did is also train the algorithm on what people mean when they search for something in an e-commerce context right because the machine learning algorithm should be able to identify when somebody looks for say if something like women's white jeans in apparel versus a 2% nonfat milk in grocery what does the context of that search query actually means right so we've actually passed the algorithm with over 200 million products and we've also trained it in every single vertical so the system today understands how do you assign weights to keywords and search queries when it is typed in a specific context right.
rep,and like some of the examples on this is if you take the example of say a woman's white jeans if you understand most of the search algorithms are built with the traditional tf-idf logic which essentially ranks a particular term of a query highest depending on its rarity or popularity so in this context of women's white jeans it will rank since white is the rarest it will rank it with the highest number it will give its the highest idf score and it will give the lowest idf score to jeans but an e-commerce context actually jeans is most important right because you have to first find jeans then you have to find something which is in the color of white and then you have to find something which is suitable for women and then show products so that is how we've built our algorithm which is why our relevance is slightly better.
rep,any questions on this i'm sorry for the long explanation.
prospect,no no no that's really good i've been working on internal search since the since the solutions came out so i've been in e-commerce for 20 years so i do like that i like you know one of the things that most disappointed in was when mercado went away because it was superior to everything out there at the time but i worked with <celebrals> i worked with sli  i've worked with endeca i've worked with adam search actually the only people i haven't worked with the you guys.
rep,okay so you will probably get an opportunity sometimes so i just thought of giving you this background because it's important to let you know as to how what is the approach we've taken to build the product so that you get some context on the whole way we've approached it right.
rep,so let me go to some used cases that i found on the site right so i looked at some product specific queries when i look for pregnancy test kits on the site right this is what i searched for but if you also have a navigation page which has a specific order of listing for these pregnancy kits and there is an order in which they're listed but if you look at search they're extremely different from how you would actually show up on a category page right some of the things are also not very relevant to what you would actually find and i'll show you this i'll send you this report you can actually review this in more detail right.
rep,right another thing that i noticed was when i look for a calvin klein ck men's perfume right you obviously have more than one perfume on the category page right but when i search for it i only get get shown one single product right is it because i have not spelt the calvin klein word in its entirety or if there is something else at the back end which is not letting me show more products i only see one the third thing i look for is i look for something to do with a specific theme.
rep,because considering walgreens also sells medicines people would come with a specific condition to look for a specific product i look for medicine for cold right we obviously have a lot more medicines on cold this is what you would see with your navigation section but again this is what you see with your search section again there is a lot of inconsistency as to how the products are ended right and then lastly i looked for some feature query where i look for a very specific feature where i look for a black nail paint right or a nail color right you obviously have nail colors but again when i search for it you have a mixture of thinners and a different color name color that's coming up and a few black nail colors as well right these are some of the things that actually found the from a overall perspective.
rep,then i looked at your first experience which is autofill this is where i think it's pretty good when i go and look for anything on the site on walgreens today here you have a section which guides me then you have some visual elements allocated to that so that was a good thing that i saw on the site right.
rep,one recommendation i had i'll just take you to some of the things we've built when it comes to autofill right i'll take you through probably two or three vertical just to get you some context on on on how we have built it right.
rep,with when it comes to express the approach we took was they are an omnichannel retailer they have a lot of stores and they also have an online presence which is actually growing pretty well in the last two years so we wanted to give their users a looking field where when they go to an express store they obviously will first go to a specific tile then look at a specific category and then look at a specific product right so we wanted to give a similar experience with an auto fun auto fill function where they also have the same product discovery path right so today if i start looking for say something like jeans on the site right we wanted to show is it jeans for women jeans for men or is it jeans of a specific style and then express wanted us to put up a segmentation block depending on the geo-location that i'm coming in from they wanted to show a specific color of jeans or a kind of feature of jeans it's actually very popular in that region.
rep,so we added the geo segment there and then we showed the popular products and as you hover around these products change right and we made a change in real time as well because now if you actually look for dress as a query express does not have dress for men so men as an option will not even show up right but the moment i look for dress shirt then you'll actually see options for men because dress shirts are available for men right some bit of customizations we've tried right but if you go to say a retailer like ss396 who actually sell auto parts for them it's important for you for a customer to drill down to a specific model of a car that that you actually want to buy a part for right so now if i go and search for mirror on that site the first navigation boxes would actually for me to identify which car model i'm actually looking for and then it actually shows me products available and since they actually have a grocery kind of behavior where people might not come to this site to just buy one part but usually they buy anywhere between four to six products in a transaction they wanted an option where you can actually change quantity and add products to cart from the search box itself so we built a functionality like that right.
rep,and then when it comes to grocery we work with fresh direct and a fairly large grocery retailer out of india they are called big basket they do about two billion dollars in revenue online today and it's an online only company right so for them again their cart size is about forty products in every transaction and what we built for them is if i'm i want to buy chicken the way we built is essentially your customer can actually change quantity and add products to cart from the search box depending on a zip code we can actually show up a specific discount or a banner and then we show commonly searched terms popular brands and categories right.
rep,and then we do the step further because if you have a lot of returning visitors on the site if i always buy chicken with skin chicken with skin shows up to me on top if you buy say chicken boneless chicken boneless appears on top field so we tried making those personalization logic adjustments as well so some of the themes that we've actually built on autosuggest and again the intent of showing you different verticals was this is not a temporary driven approach we have we actually end up building something which is very relevant for you as a retailer and whatever makes most sense to you.
prospect,just quick real quick you guys are in mountain home or mountain view sorry you're in mountain view.
prospect,have you guys and just like at big basket have you guys done any work with safeway.
rep,no not yet we've been speaking to safeway but we haven't made progress yet.
prospect,okay i i turned down a chief digital officer position there at safeway a few months back and they were talking about how they were going to be investing much more in digital innovation so.
prospect,it will be perfect for them.
rep,yeah i know i always say this to myself so but yeah but i just wanted to give you some context but i i do see what you guys have built is also fairly it's it's fairly custom to what line of business you are into but these are some of the other options i thought i probably bounce a few that you could probably consider doing this way right.
prospect,so do you have an example of a beauty retailer.
rep,yeah beauty retailer i think we work with bh cosmetics these guys are based out of la they are midsize we get that roughly about fifty million dollars online revenue so here if i start looking for any kind of a nail color or lip color right so this is the autosuggest they have built for themselves and in beauty since there are so many variations and bh cosmetics does not have a huge number of skus they wanted us to start showing them options right from the first letter that we start typing in right i start looking for moisturizer or just some m it will essentially show based on popularity does it mean a mascara or does it mean a makeup organizer or a makeup bag and then it will show me options and it will show me a recommendation widget on all the popular products based on the geo i'm coming in from then shows me top queries and key word suggestions.
rep,so i mean we build it as what you would want as a retailer we will give you a lot of inputs on what we can build out because these days we're getting a lot of requests on doing some very specific segmentation logics built in one is a geo segment that people generally ask us for the other one is a device segment they ask us to build as to what do you show when somebody is logging in from a desktop versus mobile and even within mobile what do you show to somebody logging from an iphone versus a samsung versus a motorola right those are the two segments that we commonly are asked to integrate.
rep,then then off late we have asked we are seeing retailers because they spend so much money on their channels right you spend a ton of money on google adwords on your facebook campaigns on your email campaigns so what products do you show to people who actually come from any of these channels so that's another popular segment that we've seen with we've seen a lot of investors interest sorry retailer's interest on and asking us to help them target these different channels in a very customized way.
rep,any other questions so far.
prospect,no no no that's good um it's just the when when you guys do a demonstration for for some of the product management teams and part part of what i do my kind of my role at walgreens is i'm a prior cto and i took a marketing role at walgreens.
rep,okay thats interesting which.
prospect,yeah and especially what what it is is i brand marketing i've been a cmo ceo and cto um and so i was i went to walgreens through an acquisition and um and i told him i was resigning and just going to do consulting and they told me no you can work from home run run these programs and then one of the things that i do is i help them to evaluate platform vendors so anytime someone calls into walgreens and says they've got a marketing or a technology solution and then sure you know who would be the right team to evaluate it it comes to my inbox.
prospect,to kind of give you a better better chance of you know demonstrating what the end stakeholder is going to be looking for and so that was why i talked about the cosmetics you know the beauty industry is you know many on the digital side and on the store side the business for walgreens there's a major initiative to go deeper into beauty and - and so what that means is there's more people that have goals assigned with growth in the area of the beauty industry in our catalogue.
rep,okay makes sense.
prospect,so yeah so what i would what i would recommend is if you guys have a couple other beauty beauty examples i would put those together a lot of what you showed me was really good but i would make sure i include those in your next demonstration with walgreens because that's gonna resonate more because they have goals around it.
rep,makes a lot of sense.
prospect,okay i'll let you continue but i was just gonna give you that kind of context because what will happen you know is i'll be having some discussions with the internal search team and i'll and i'll bring up unbxd and see have you guys spoke with christin marx or adam crouch at all.
rep,i have to just get back to you on that because there is another colleague of mine who's managed a lot of conversations in the past especially in the last one year so i'll definitely check with him but he did tell me that there's being a few conversation with walgreens especially in the beginning of last year so i'll have to just check with him on that.
prospect,okay alright alright because the three primary stakeholders would be adam crouch christin marx and wayne dwayne and those are the people that i'll speak to about specifically about the solution.
prospect,but the but definitely like i said you know they're going to be highly incentivized to do two things one is improve the experience for people that are are either in store or going to store so for example with walgreens the types of products we sell based on some of the search terms we know the context so for example if you're searching for pepto-bismol you wanting it now you're not gonna go and wait for it again you're not waiting for that to get to the house so some so some terms that we know that that they're that they are searching for we know they have a local context.
prospect,and so have you guys worked with anybody where you know brick-and-mortar where the the local aspect was was more you know more <than> focused.
rep,yeah actually when you talk about ashley right so for them they have over 3000 stores 6600 stores are actually company owned and the others have a franchise kind of a model and they have 19 different pricing zones and the inventory literally changes depending on the location that you're actually coming in from so it's a lot more localization that you'll have to do depending on which state and with city i'm coming in from both from a pricing perspective as well as what products do you actually show people people in that geo perspective because in furniture the issue is somebody logging into ashley from say manhattan the kind of furniture he or she would be looking for will be vastly different from somebody looking for furniture in the bay area so there's a lot more localization you have to do when it comes to that.
rep,so that that is the home-improvement example like you can even even in apparel right there's so much of localization that you need from a personalization perspective because i'll give you an example so if you go and look for jackets on a on an apparel site so if if you're from say chicago and i'm from say tampa right a it should show you a thicker jacket b it should show you a show me a lighter jacket right and secondly you might have 50 thicker jackets in your inventory to show so what do you show it to you versus somebody else coming in from the same location so that's where again a lot of localization will be required.
rep,the second layer of localization we have recently built in is even within chicago if you're looking for jackets in july versus you're looking for jackets in january what kind of jackets do you actually show today.
rep,so these are some of the  elements we have built-in to the algorithm stack actually.
prospect,and for you guys it's client based and i'm just asking you this mainly because i do have you know i've been working in the industry for years so i've got a tons of tons of friends but i know one group that was actually looking for looking for possibly an internal search solution but when they were looking for internal search and and we're kind of the same way they're kind of looking for internal search to also drive some of the navigation elements so do you guys do you know what outside of just the internal search experience what else do do people use to drive their you know their product rides or you know how do you guys interact with the rest of the site.
rep,yeah actually category navigation is another fairly key element that we have built out and that's where a lot of these personalization comes in right because you might have a specific category say say if i'll use the same example jackets or shoes right what do you show to you versus what do you show to me like if i go to walgreens today and i look at okay say beauty as a vertical since it's something which is of interest of everybody internally within walgreens so what do you show show as products for me versus what products do you show for you.
rep,that can be very different from a category navigation perspective itself because gone are the days were just by having some dynamic faceting showing more more popular facets on top and trying to make the page look prettier is what category navigation meant today it's a lot more of these personalization elements that could actually come into forte.
rep,and the challenge with personalization is especially for category navigation is because is because you probably can't do one is to one personalization for more than 15-20 percent of your traffic because you need to know a lot about an individual to do one is to one position accurately so that is where we introduced the entire segmentation and targeting the things i spoke to you about the geo segmentation segmentation by a specific channel as to which channel you are actually coming in from segmentation by a visitor type are you a new visitor or are you a repeat visitor right so these are different logics we've built in to make sure that from a category navigation a the merchants have more control and b the machine learning algorithm itself can start showing products more intelligently.
rep,sorry for the long answer.
rep,so actually while we're on this topic i'll show you a quick video it's like a two minute dashboard video that we've built probably it might give you some more context on this if you could see my screen so one of the things we realize this no matter how strong an ai we build merchandisers will know their business better than everybody else so what we did is to add the segmentation logic we let merchandisers create custom landing pages or campaigns or vanity urls for any kind of a query or a category right so a you can go and define a query and category and define rule sets along when do you start it when do you end it but then you also start defining segments today we give you the ability where you can go and define a custom landing page for say a new user coming in from an iphone device from manhattan upper east and who has clicked on an email channel what is exactly the kind of products you want to show to him versus somebody who is a new visitor coming from a tablet device which is a samsung tablet from new jersey which is a suburb coming in from a facebook campaign.
rep,so we give a lot more flexibility for merchandisers to define what kind of campaigns they run and as they are going and running the campaign we also show you the sticker which tells you within your analytics what's the potential reach of this campaign going towards right and once you create this campaign what we also realized is marketing teams will have conflicting ideas so the best way to see which idea works best for your customers is to actually letting them do an a/b test on live traffic once you've chosen a segment for the campaign also a/b test it and say i decide the winner of an a/b test by the highest number of clicks or add to cart or say actual conversions itself and whichever campaign wins in a/b test that campaign is effective for the rest of the time period of the campaign right.
rep,and once you do this then you go and apply any kind of boosting goals where you can boost slot sort or pin and then as you keep changing these rule sets the preview here also keeps changing and we've made it simple drag and drop features given you levers to actually move things along and also given you the ability to set complex rules so if i come and look for say look for conditioners within your beauty category page i can always dictate and say the first two conditioners you show me are probably the two brands it's give me the highest margins three and four could be the two products which are new releases five and six could be the two products which i want to push out of inventory.
rep,so you can essentially control your entire navigation experience and make it personal to every user coming to the site the ultimate aim of this entire category navigation experience for us which we want to achieve as soon as possible is is how do you create a million different experiences to a million different users actually coming to your site we're still somewhere in the middle of that process but ultimately that's the aim of this entire personalization product does that make sense.
prospect,it makes a lot of sense alright.
rep,so this was about sorry for digressing a lot upon this but again just to continue the current context another thing that you noticed was some of these stemmed word elements that i actually saw sun screen versus sun cream essentially does not show me any results versus shows me a lot of results similarly i looked at a soft soap or a moisturizing soap i found different results i misspelled the word tylenol on the site it essentially returned queries which are not very relevant.
rep,and these are some of the things i'm sure there is an entire team working on making this work right for you but our whole logic was why do you have to build this manually when you actually have a system which can do this automatically for you i'll give you a quick example while we're on this like i i think we spoke about this black leather jacket example right if i have to now misspell the word black leather jacket and which are all the three words to be honest spell it as say blck leathe jaket okay one thing we have done is we've made the system trained where it can autocorrect all the words and also show you result from the word book and the same thing goes for different stemmed words like t-shirts spelt in different ways right t-shirts t - shirts t space shirts and tees without you having to build a manual list of synonyms how can we automatically lead you to the right set of results.
rep,so those are nuances we have built within the platform and this synonym repository is always growing at our end and we are as of now in more than 98 percent of the cases you don't have to go and build anything manually at all at your back end so that's the efficiency that we have today.
rep,and then on relevancy i showed you a few examples right so some of the things that we would solve for are even things like say dress on sale right what it will do is essentially parse your inventory and bring up all the products they're actually on sale and now if i go and look for something like dress on clearance and actually misspelled the word clearance it will a auto correct itself and also show me the same number of results that you saw for dress on sale because inherently it understands that sale and clearance and people are typing those things they are essentially looking for a discounted product.
rep,<>and we can do fairly complex things like if you go and look at since they also have store if you just go and look for a store locater right it will essentially direct you to a page which has the location of all the stores within the site it does the similar things for it if you look hit return it will automatically take you to the returns page.
rep,so all these non product queries natural language queries you don't have to start building redirects manually all these actually happen automatically within the system.
rep,ok so yeah and these are the same things i have actually captured on the site and i have also tested the same things for mobile today and how does it actually work on mobile and i've actually included some of the recommendations on that in this report and i'll email this to you after this call so that you get some context ahead.
rep,so you know and this again i know we're running short of time one thing i also want to show you is despite all the analytics we also have this dashboard i showed you the merchandising section of the dashboard but we also made a fairly comprehensive dashboard for all our products for search for your product recommendations and for your category navigation where you a get a quick executive summary of the entire revenues through that specific channel it could be through search or through category pages where you get high level metrics you essentially can manage your different domains or production site staging site from a single console and you also have access to a fairly comprehensive reporting to some final elements of search and category pages which you might not find on an omniture or a google analytics.
rep,so those are some of the things that we've tried building out and especially in the context of search what we've done is we are giving you metrics on your autofill feature and we also giving you metric on your search feature as well right and in search a you get a high level reporting on your top search queries your zero results clicked products and order  products and you also have a fairly in-depth reporting where you can now go and drill down for every query when it comes to search and for every category or a custom landing page when it comes to category pages where you can see how every specific asset is actually doing for you you can go and drill down and see how every query like say a dress is doing and see all the products associated to this query and the business metrics of that query so if last week this query was converting at 3 point 8 percent and now it's dropped with 3 point 6 percent you immediately know that there were probably a few popular products which went out of stock which is why the performance of this query actually dropped.
rep,similarly in a category navigation report you will actually see the same thing for a specific category right and finally we have a similar reporting for your auto-fill feature like all these feature sets you build your in-feature your keyword suggestion your top query and your popular product widget whatever you use within the auto-fill we have fairly comprehensive reporting on every action that a user takes so that you actually know whether this specific format that you built is actually working for you are people using it and if people are using it are they actually converting from it so that you have more refined data to constantly review and look at next steps.
rep,so yeah that was a quick high-level background i wanted to through because i don't want to give out make it too information overload but i just wanted to give you all the finer elements of the key things that we actually do and then look for your advice and suggestion as to how do you think we could actually approach though we do too many things we could probably take up one small thing that you think might be most important to walgreens it could be even as even a category that we could take up say a beauty category that we could take up and try solving it for that category and show some significant performance gains with that category and then see how we can go from there so just thought i'll ask your inputs on that.
prospect,so so your product just to be clear you guys are really more of a standalone standalone search platform versus you wouldn't integrate with elastic right.
rep,no we can actually coexist with elastic like we coexist with solar we coexist with in some cases even on endeca because they can't get rid of endeca very quickly so you can use bits and pieces of our product but essentially we have the capabilities to essentially replace any of these solutions as well.
rep,but i generally don't use the word replacement because most it folks don't like it especially when they've put a year of migrating from say one to another and you come and say that you're replacing it they generally don't like it so it's a politically correct statement to sometimes make that we could actually coexist show the value then if we're actually making more sense then probably they'll take a decision of replacing the existing solution with us so.
prospect,okay yeah that make sense.
rep,so any feedback.
prospect,well you know it's it's pretty slick and i do like i do like a lot of segmentation options you know i'll have to discuss with the internal search team kind of what their objectives are what they're looking for let's see if you know your your core your guys's core offering is something that's aligned more with what they're trying to achieve but it it does look really slick.
rep,thank you and even since you're so well connected in the retail space if you come across people who are actually looking for somebody pleased to put in a good word i know i'll also send you my details please feel free to refer and.
prospect,yeah definitely definitely send them to because there's an apparel group that recently reached out to me not too long ago a buddy of mine that was in a prior startup with me and and he was asking me about internal search solutions.
prospect,so it you know definitely you know do you guys you guys feel like you're you you're priced well for a small to mid-size.
rep,we do we work with people of all sizes so we can work out on the pricing.
prospect,okay alright well i'm gonna talk talk a bit with him and see if he wants to maybe you know get a get a demonstration from you.
rep,yeah absolutely oh you are actually based out of vegas.
prospect,yeah i work out of my home in vegas.
rep,wow okay actually we were there till last night we go the shoptalk conference we could have actually met in person for the coffee.
prospect,yeah i actually popped down there to meet with a couple of folks at shoptalk i didn't go to the show oh but i stopped popped in there i had dinner i'm about about thirty minutes away from the street.
rep,ohh okay.
prospect,so it's easy for me to pop down there but i don't have to normally deal with all the vegas traffic i live up up north a little bit a little bit cooler and a lot more like you know suburban.
rep,okay nice nice that's a good good place to live in though you have all the fun and you have all this identity as well so that's a nice balance.
prospect,yeah it's really nice you don't have all them you don't have to deal with all the all the vegas strip crap but if you want to go like we we pop down to talk with some folks at shoptalk and then and then we caught a rod stewart concert last night and then just came back.
rep,ohh okay that's nice.
prospect,yeah kind of kind of a good situation good to good setup and then of course i get because i work in both the marketing and a technology capacity it's good to be able to just pop in and go to multiple trade shows so michael the the dns for walgreens i handle all the dns requests so even though i'm in marketing all of the dns requests have to come through me because i i'm gonna look at them from a marketing perspective a technology perspective a security perspective i do all of that so it's a kind of a broad role so to keep up to date with all of those different things it's good to be somewhere where i can go to a lot of trade shows.
rep,you seem to have the best of all worlds now.
prospect,i already well i better get going i got another call i got a jump on but i do appreciate it and it looks really slick and like i said i know right now that the primary focus for everybody is just trying to clean up you know the migration headaches from from the transition.
prospect,alright well i appreciate it it was great great speaking to you today.
rep,thank you sir great talking to you too you have a nice evening ahead.
prospect,alright take care bye bye.
rep,thank you so much for joining the call so this was a quick agenda had prepared for today roughly timing towards 35 40 minutes and i would leave the rest of the time open for questions i wanted to give you a quick background about us i know you're already spoken over here but mostly spend time on a quick study as a review that period for further ford's what we generally do in this review is essentially look at your product discovery function what's the what's that was see our customers experience when they go through your site when it comes to discovering products and eventually buying them.
rep,so we do a quick review and we also want to share it with you and then we can take a quick tour of our product our merchandising tool and and then open up for any kind of questions so that was essentially the agenda at the perfect anything else you guys wanted to cover on today's call.
prospect,no you could just um really stress and elaborate as much as you can on your search relevance and you know most of our customers are repeat customers that probably by the same thing over and over 80% of the time so it's not it's not customers coming through and looking for a red dress its customers who know exactly what they want and it needs to be extremely easy them to find that product.
prospect,and then you know for her first it's just you know we have 5000 different types of produce and we have 30 different types of spinach so someone types in spinach you know there should be a lot of there should be a very you know smart algorithm there based on their buying behaviour and what they've bought in the past and you know it's it's it's a little bit different than the conventional b2c e-commerce experience i just wanted to kind of stress that and the more you can kind of stress and show the value that you could bring to our merchandising strategy into our search engine the the better and more productive this call to be.
rep,awesome i actually focus only on that there so just to give you a quick background about us but it all you get a mountain view company being around for 6yrs for now work with about 120 enterprise clients over 1200 websites we have plugin for magento and char a lot more customers on this is a base config of other things today we actually do about 2.
rep,5 billion interactions a month and we've seen success in almost every vertical on e-commerce so fashion and retail has been our sweet spot especially apparel that's where we got our most number of customers initially express luke 21 just started working out of new york with ann taylor and laughed nine west calm michael kors they're all i'm going through implementation at this point in time but as you wanted to also figure out we also work with a lot of b2b home improvement and grocery companies as well work with fresh direct that is from new york.
prospect,what you do with them
rep,so we primarily power their entire relevancy they have taken our site search and are tactically navigation product we've implemented site search on them minus the auto suggest but everything to do i also suggest or something that will be live i think my 1st of may but the entire relevancy as of today is chosen by unbxd i'm happy to get your reference calls with them just to figure out how that experience has been but i'll talk to you about everything that we've done for them and the kind of revenue impact we've had for them.
rep,we also work with the similar grocery out of southeast asia it's called big basket dot com then we've actually implemented it into end and if they're extremely logic like they're larger than freshdirect they do over two billion dollars and online revenue per year.
rep,and yeah and we work with ashley furniture in the home improvement space work with bed bath & beyond work with a couple of b2b companies highly supply of milwaukee similar use case that you mentioned most of them their customers are also repeat customers they exactly know what to buy us auto fairly similar you scan especially on the b2b side they also have a b2c presence for fine container again a strong b2b example discount two-way radio but give you i can take you to some bunch of use cases just to give you more specifics on what we do.
rep,and the good thing about the product is you could be on a standard enterprise platform like atg websphere the hybris which is the bulk of our customers at least the enterprise customers or you could be on a custom homegrown platform all be using a plug-in from shopify or magento the solution is built to be completely platform agnostic so it doesn't matter what platform you're on but this is this is annette by i is that the homegrown platform you have today or is it one of these standard platforms of use .
prospect,homegrown.
rep,homegrown ok good to know. and from our solution
prospect,doesn't that make your homegrown in your integration of the more difficult.
rep,no it shouldn't because it's typically our integration of either in page ajax or api in both these cases if you're using homegrown and say using solar today for example or elasticsearch essentially the response solar would give to your application we would essentially mimic the same response from an epa perspective so effectively there's your system doesn't even have to know as to what even decorated or if you using in pay days at all you do is give us a header put an ad in 3d of that and we're doing the html english and i'll take you through those approaches but the answer is it shouldn't be difficult.
rep,okay a quick snapshot on our product seat itself as i told you we do end-to-end product discovery site search was a cool product that's the product we started our company with but we also now built out products for covering all your category pages we ha we have product recommendation product essentially we use a widget strategy there so every single widget will probably see on amazon today right from you also you bought also bought upsell cross-sell by the loop complete the set they built all these widgets all you have to do with a simple javascript install it machine learning picks it up and starts throwing up the most recommended products and off late that was in q4 last year we also introduced a segment and target product very similar to adobe segment and target but the strength of this product is essentially if you are already using our site search and category navigation and personalization products these are already a lot of learning so we can essentially segment and toggle from day one and i'll take you to us to what we do when it comes to segment and target in this work so this is essentially the whole gamut of product discovery a over it just as in a fire.
rep,but what i'll do is for the interest of this call in  call i will focus a little more on site search but i also give you some quick context on yeah the products is so that you understand from our overall rout map a perspective as to how you could position unbxd.
rep,okay any questions so far on this.
prospect,not for me teddy.
rep,so let me quickly go through the third study we've prepared and i'll email this to you when <> so that you can review this at your convenience so one of the core things that we've done is we've essentially tried mimicking the product discovery behaviour from a search perspective so we focused this report on the current relevancy on the site looked at the current experience on the site from our first impact perspective how is the auto fill today's visual as if guided is it more relevant then looked at the entire error tolerance in the site both from a spellcheck perspective and from a synonym detection and correction detector and then finally looked at the mobile elements of the site so essentially tried it's not to take digger the site it's essentially for us to understand it but it's an opportunity for us right.
rep,and just before i get started just wanted to give you a quick background on how we have built our entire relevancy algorithm because it's it's a fact today to talk about machine learning and ai everybody talks about that but i wanted to show some more light how we've approached this yes it's a machine learning platform yes it's a artificial intelligence but the way we have built and from the day we started building the platform is we've actually trained the algorithm with over 200 million products in the retail landscape we also trained it per vertical so the system today can understand when you refer to something at women's white jeans in apparel or a 2% nonfat dairy milk in grocery what does those two search queries actually mean right because from any detailed context it's all very different because most search algorithms have been built using the whole tf-idf concept but even google today for search uses that the only issue with the tf-idf algorithm is it's primarily built for document search and not necessarily for retail product search.
rep,okay so if you look at say a quick example for query like women's white jeans with the tf-idf algorithm the scores would be the highest to white then to women and then to jeans because white is the rarest in jeans this is probably not so at all.
rep,but from a retail landscape in e-commerce jeans becomes most important then it's to men and then it's white so that's the whole premise on which we will build the tf-idf algorithm which is very very ecommerce context-aware and i'll take you to some examples and then another thing that we've done is we've also tried identifying and building our algorithm to solve for natural language use cases because people today don't just come and look for carrots they probably look for a 200 gram carrot pack or a freshly cut carrot or a packed carrot so it's it's a very different way that people search for products today.
rep,and we wanted our algorithm to understand what the context of a search is and then resolve to the most appropriate product and i will take you through examples on that but just total view on background.
rep,and just this was a quick check we did on the relevancy so we did use multiple kinds of queries use some product type queries look for fresh juices or meat alternatives right essentially this is how your navigation displays these products this is how the search results come up it's not about this being correct or incorrect it's about the experience that someone would get when they actually get into a navigation section even in a fresh juice or you have actually mute alternatives if actually you can filter it down and you have products relevant to that but when i search for it probably the essential context of water fresh juices or meat alternatives is not thoroughly captured and that's why you find inconsistencies and results of somebody searching for that product versus somebody going through the browser functionality right and then if i look for sliced radish again you have the similar allegations section but essentially when you search for radish this is showing me cheese it's probably looking at the word sliced which is probably there in one of these product detail pages and hence showing that cheese which is sliced and probably not essentially radish and this is what you'll typically find in most search implementations because it's either using an and-ing or an or-ing what we've built is a complex excel function which helps it understands the context a little more better right .
rep,and then look for kosher bread again you have these products available but again it does not show up from a search perspective right this was a quick relevancy dip check i did.
rep,when i look at your ui function from our auto fill standpoint i started looking for yogurt the good thing is you have a guided auto suggest which is great to know but one of the things that we've identified which works well i'll take you to a big basket example as to what i need by a visual auto suggest we believe that any more relevancy you've also said the same thing to fresh direct because fresh direct is similar layout they haven't guided auto suggest they don't have visual the product that we're implementing now which will see live from 1st of may is a visual auto suggest function and i'll take you through what we've done for other retailers from visual auto suggest.
prospect,so was that your main is that was that your main goal for fresh direct was visual auto suggest.
rep,one of the goals so the one of the one of the goal was relevancy because there's search relevancy was extremely broken multiple reasons a because the catalogue itself was slightly broken so we had to fix the data elements on the catalogue feed first then work on the relevancy aspect with one of the things we do in a poc module because every business is so vastly different when it comes to search we have something called as a poc where we actually come and implement within a 30-day window and let you use the product for 60 days and in those 60 days we guarantee you or 10% lift and searched conversions you don't see it you don't have to pay as anything you walk away no questions asked you actually see a 10% lift you continue with us so there is at least a quick check that even you can do whether a the investment that you would be making towards unbxd does even actually make sense and what we have done i will give you a quick anecdote when fresh direct has a 50 cent increase in average order value they essentially open up a champagne on the sixth floor executive center when we went live in the first 90 days we had a $4 17 cent increase in average order value that's the kind of impact we brought to the table.
prospect,from search.
rep,in this address from search alone yeah and they hide our 18% increase in conversions so in the first 90 days so i met and we've addressed that primarily to relevancy and what we believe in phase two when we actually implement you auto suggest function that growth will be even higher and i'll actually take you so just showing you this let me just take you through some examples to build right.
rep,i can give you examples of three to four different verticals just so that you get a context on different kinds of customisation we can just do in the auto spell function right this.
rep,is a parts company and for them the use case was people either come in search by a part number or by model name like either people know exactly what they want or they don't know what they want so they actually had to search boxes before they came to us that kind of amplified the problem on relevancy and the results got really solved so there were two things with it for it so one was we built them apart finder from a browser experience so that they can find any part in three clicks and from search we had a unified search experience where if i say pick up this name the cell i start searching for the cell so on one side you see parts the other side you see model names and then you have the third box which essentially shows all the top searches starting with the iss right and then if you click on anything and go into a pdp page versus an apparel space like express right that high fashion they want segmentation because people's buying behaviour changes even on the city that they're actually coming from today if i go and look for something like jeans the way they want is to give an experience to a customer even going into a retail store of express where first you will go into an ai then you will go into a category and then you'll go into a product right similar on online they wanted a similar experience so jeans is it for women am i buying it for myself what am i buying it for my spouse or am i looking at four genes in a specific style and then we introduced a segmentation block where depending on the location that the user was coming in from what is the most popular at locations for new york city probably gray's most popular show the segmentation block for new york city which actually drill this down to us of course we can differentiate upper manhattan versus bronx vs harlem versus new jersey which might be relevant for you in a grocery use case where things or products might change project code and then we saw the popular product and vision as you keep holding around the images actually change so from a apparel fashion landscape but actually make sense versus what are you going .
prospect,quick question what share so it sounds like with part of recommendations you are very bullish on imagery versus just text it do you have studies or results that show that this is just how people have become to process information that people have become much more visual versus text driven i mean because if you can see you know google is very little i guess i had a little bit of imagery but google's mostly text driven with what's your what's your thought approach on imagery versus just text.
rep,we've actually done a lot of a/b test in fact when i show you the dashboard we actually give you the ability to actually run an a/b test look just having text versus having text and visuals on almost every a/b desk you've done before we go live with every retailer we've seen that imagery has shown double-digit improvement in conversions versus text but again it can be very different for your business for bed bath and beyond we didn't do imagery that was probably the only use case where imagery did not make a significant difference and indexing became a huge problem because for having imagery you also need to have an image of the product in bed bath with over 5 million skus they decided not to go with image so they still if you go to bed bath & beyond and look at the auto fill function it's still texture.
prospect,did they not have images ready to go or this is it they did they just chose not to use them.
rep,so if they didn't have images for all the five million skus the long tail was getting screwed up.
prospect,how many skus they have.
rep,five million skus.
prospect,five million.
prospect,oh shit.
rep,so one kind of imagery for all this yeah so that was getting a little screwed up and then they and then they have a internal <> response times needing to be under 100 milliseconds our sla is generally 300 milliseconds and with all this imagery and the functional because we need to make to a database we could not come under the hundred millisecond sla so essentially they decided that they go without the imagery .
rep,so it was more of a business that's called see we can customise it because it's ultimately our business so you need to be comfortable with what you want to put up but we've generally seen with studies that imagery adds <>.
rep,and i'll give you this example of this so this is what we've done for a big basket this was the site i was telling you there's a largest graphically sized in southeast asia they do two billion dollars online and so then the use case was probably very similar to whatever is about.
prospect,a mail order is a delivery.
rep,the delivery .
prospect,so they do they do their own delivery like fresh direct they send us in the mail.
rep,no do they do there own delivery they have actually two modes of delivery one is a 60 minute delivery was actually delivered in bikes because in the markets they operate mostly in indonesia and india bikes are a lot more common so if you need a product if you need your delivery in under 60 minutes actually deliver it in a bike versus of you want a one-day delivery they usually have a truck which simply goes into every area and they deliver and there's been some crazy economics on that.
prospect,<> i haven't ever heard of them.
rep,and them they've grown from 100 million to two billion in the last 36 months it's being a massive scale that they built up.
rep,and yeah 90% of businesses now in india they just expanded to indonesia there will be expanding gulf pretty soon me.
prospect,surprise amazon or someone else's and try to buy them early.
rep,even i'm surprised amazon is pretty big in india but yeah there's some unbxd it probably a very extensive dubai right now so there doesn't need to be making but yeah their use cases fairly simple that i think was very similar to what you spoke about they have 42 products in a transaction that's the average cart size a lot of repeat buying and they also have a huge buying behaviour on tablets and mobile phones as well in india most retailers have the same thing more than 50 to 70% of the traffic to mobile devices so what they did was essentially this so they wanted to add 42 products you end up going to 150 clicks they wanted quick add to kart option because in grocery you don't have to literally examine a lot of things you want to buy it's probably the same products you want to buy so what they did is essentially if i want to look at buying chicken we've built an auto fill functionality where you can change quantity and add products to cart right from the search box.
rep,and then depending on your zip code we can show up an offer for your zip code then you have all the commonly searched terms your popular brands and categories and this was what i was talking but like if you want the under 60-minute delivery you have a bike that delivers and then you have a cart.
rep,so the whole intent of building this was essentially you would have gone into a pdp page selected the quantity selected which mode of delivery is selected the quantity and then you added to cart so we are trying to avoid those three different clicks that you're making by essentially showing your products right here right and then the depending if you're a repeat user if there is a specific kind of chicken you always buy that product actually shows up on top so you can quickly add to cart right from here and then move on so these are different ways you can build it and we have built something similar to this customer they're based out of connecticut ss396 they're into auto parts so you essentially all you do is choose a model number and then look at buying a specific product and then you can actually add products to cart right from the first search box so these are generally this kind of a structure or autofill is relevant for especially businesses like yours so people either buy a lot more products and there's a fair high amount of the be purchase behaviour and for big basket this this kind of a model hugely entry to improve their conversions because we can buy products and finish a transaction and five ten minutes versus having to go through a half an hour buying window.
prospect,wow that's cool.
rep,right so actually then look at some no not synonymous words and spell checks like i replace the word three inch with like double quotes versus an inch like dice carrots versus cut carrots did see different kinds of product showing up and then misspelled the word mozilla since we had no results show up so these are another set of functions that we try to automate essentially today.
rep,i forgot to ask you this question we use solar elasticsearch what do you use to search today.
prospect,so i don't even know that what solar means.
rep,okay solar is an open source search tool that most custom platforms essentially used to build if you also by sap hybris or hybris your solar comes default it built in its own art so people generally use that for solving site search or they use lucene or the use elasticsearch generally these are the three common things i come across so just want to check what do you guys use of search today.
prospect,you know we've i don't even think i don't think we've used any kind of any open source options that we've continued to that it's so it's so fragile we play with our algorithm the algorithm is heavily relate on items that based on our sales velocity as a catalogue so if you type in chael.
prospect,system identifies you know the the the the accuracy of the item itself is like the hot that most heavily way part of the algorithm number two is the velocity in which so let's let's show them the number one selling kale and then number three is kales it this person buy before but yeah there's no it's obviously very fragile and there's no misspellings and there's no yeah it's it's we're basically at ground zero when it comes to when it comes to search as you can tell.
rep,and i think one of the huge challenges when this approaches you end up doing so many things manual which ends up taking away a lot of bandwidth from from people fine so what you've tried doing is for all these error corrections synonym detection we've tried building out-of-the-box solution so that we can actually get things automatically resolved rather than having to go through a fairly manual functional there i'll show you a few examples actually let me just pull this off like if you go to express like the way this thing is intelligent there is now if you go started were looking for address this is not even available for men in their catalogue so it doesn't even show men is an option but the moment you start change this to dress shirt dress shirt is available for men so men is an option will actually start coming up right and then from a spell check perspective take up three letter word black leather jacket like i can misspell all the three words i can say b-l-c-k-t-e-t-h-j-e-k-e-t so what it will do is it'll essentially auto correct just to black leather jacket and also show you results from the word go.
prospect,so how do you know how do you build that base of information are you using all of your logic learned across your
prospect,2.5 billion product bucks across all these websites to understand misspellings and because if you you you know you need a ton of information to be able to perform smarter and smarter or results how do you actually build that base right.
prospect,where do you get your information from.
rep,obviously with all the with like six and a half years of maturity that the algorithm has seen in right it's it's gone so over 200 million products it gets about two and a half billion search queries every month so we are algorithm has become smarter and smarter and it knows almost every permutation and combination that happens when some word is misspelled in every vertical so it cannot come auto correct itself like even things like if you look at say a t-shirt i could spell it as t- shirt or t space shirt and somebody else can probably a youngster might come and say look for tees the intent of the user is not changing ultimately they both want to go and look for t-shirt so you see about 500 results now i go and look for tees essentially a similar number will show up that's because the algorithm has seen enough iterations of t-shirts and tees and multiple ways people will be looking for that information it can recognise that and it just not does this it can also solve complex natural language things like when you look for a dress on sale right
rep,because we see these are common queries because people have either looking for some kind of sale some kind of clearance they don't want to buy anything on full value it should be able to look at the catalogue pull up all the dresses and even at a long tail show you all dresses on sale and now somebody goes and looks for dress on clearance i misspelled the word clearance it should auto correct the word clearance and then show up all the results which are actually on clearance so it does fairly complex thing and it can do even things like i can look for tops for women size 10 or size xl if you go and pull up tops which are for women which are available in size 10 that's the strength of the algorithm we've built it .
prospect,okay a few questions so a lot of these search suggestions have a limited scope of product results what's what is what is your suggestion so let's just go back to the spinach example you showed me six spinach you don't show me the one that i'm looking for what it what would be recommended would you take them into a further part of search it would take them to a category page for filtering what is usually recommended next step there.
rep,so generally when they look for we walk through there for this head queries and a carrot or a spinach and if you actually have a category page by default we take them to a category page because category pages are generally more accurated unless you don't want us to take take them go category page there is no category page available save sliced carrots right there's probably no category page available right then if you don't have anything to do with sliced carrots for a first time user on your site in month one right of our implementation or day one of our implementation where the machine learning has limited data on how people buy products on your site it let me show them carrots might not show them sliced carrots but when somebody looks for slides carrots right and they go through a specific path on the kind of products they click to eventually reach sliced carrots that entire information is that product and so when somebody else comes in look sliced carrots it will actually start pulling up the data and start showing the more relevant products so our ultimate aim is to show the most relevant products on top and then the long tail is something that you could work on you could also set up merchandising rules which i'll also take you to the dashboard itself as to what kind of rules you can also set to show products but our intent will be to show the most relevant products but i will not get into situations where we not show any products at all i will still show something which is loosely loosely relevant if nothing is available at all but we'll try and pick up from machine learning one of the things we started doing now is especially to start the code stop the code stop problem we also inject last three months analytics from a system so that there is some way that we can jump-start the machine learning algorithm and also when we start implementing we generally takes four to six weeks to go live but the first week itself we install analytics on a system so that at least the machine learning starts realising and understanding how people are going through buying behaviour on your site so that you can start being more relevant from day one sorry for the long answer but i just want.
prospect,no no well you talk to me about different languages so obviously we we were in the food service business and there's a lot of spanish-speaking users what would be your suggestion for a company like ours.
rep,so we actually solve for both english and latin based languages obviously a relevancy is much more matured for english it is picking up a lot for spanish french in german but latin based languages the algorithm sill identifies so we don't have anything for two byte characteristics with this chinese japanese and all of actually still don't have anything on that but i would say we are extremely good on english we are about 80% therefore latin based languages.
prospect,and if we wanted to.
rep,we have customers from us.
prospect,so is it kind of this is it kind of like a package that comes with this everyone to have spanish in english this is your algorithm already have built in for french and for other languages or is this something that we need to basically request .
rep,actually yes and no one is the algorithm has been built for english and spanish now so you don't have to buy a separate package it's just a summer relevancy team in perspective whenever there is a foreign language being introduced it could be spanish or german or french there'll be a one time relevancy cleaning exercise that my team will have to do so there will be more of like a one time implementation cost for that relevancy tuning but a monthly cost will not matter the monthly cost is finally based on the number of search sessions if you're just using a search product or the slave some number of site sessions if using with both for search and category navigation .
prospect,so that's that's  you guys that's you guys keep it .
prospect,so walk me through that.
rep,so its primarily based on a number of search sessions we don't generally charge you on the catalogue size unless it's more than a million skus if its under a million skus it's a fixed fee a number of sessions for a search product number of overall sessions if you're using an entire gamut of search category pages and recommendation and while we have a price based on these two what we also try doing this build up roi chart where say you like just to give you an example right if you make a hundred thousand dollars a month through search right we come in we guarantee you a ten percent incremental conversions at a minimum right so we improve your revenues by ten thousand dollars in that case so if we charge you a thousand dollars we at least want to show you that we are giving you a 10 to 20 x roi on the investment you make towards unbxd.
rep,so that's how we also calculate the otherwise so that you can take back to your management and and of convince them that ok investing on them a they'll prove the value before we actually get into a contract and then they give us a 10 to 20 x otherwise a minimum so that's how we generally try and build the use case but effectively we price you are the number of search as sessions you have.
rep,you have a approx.
prospect,you offer any flat rate to offer any flat rate solutions.
rep,well this is a flat rate that's very good it's based on a number of search sessions so what we generally do is if you tell me for the year of 2016 i had a million search sessions for the year we generally look at your growth rate and try and package a 20% buffer and give you a bucket of
rep,1.2 million sessions for the year you might have a month where you might do 40000 you might have a month you might do 250 thousand but as long as it's within that
rep,1.2 million search sessions bucket you won't get an over the tree so this will be a flat rate that will be on every month.
prospect,okay i'm sure you have some visuals will help me look into the understanding that further post call right .
rep,yeah absolutely yeah absolutely and if you have a approximate number on how many sessions you do a month i think give you a ballpark pricing number and also build like once we sign an nda can also build up other wise <> i can share it with you so that you could look and go specifics on what you might be looking at.
prospect,so what would be the so like we don't have like a pin system or everything you know if we work basically to maintain most of our product information on our erp and we have like pictures basically just pictures in our cms.
prospect,so knowing that you know i'm sure you can you could do what you need to do based on those two systems i'm sure a pin system makes it what you do a lot easier but i'm sure a lot of your clients do not have pin systems correct .
rep,so as long as you have a feed that probably you might be you giving to google today for running a paid search campaign or any feed that you have in any format it could be this song xml csv any format if they have a feed system and you can give us that feed or we have to do an api call to derive it from your cms directly one of the ways we have to get the feed that's typically what we need we can have a dynamic injection that you could do where as long as anything changes on your crm or erp effectively the counter also changes on our end or most just to avoid too many back-and-forth api calls what generally customers do is they essentially have a new feed or and enter feed that gets uploaded every every r or three or four times a day or two times a day depending on how frequently a backlog changes and we updated on it so so effectively the.
prospect,the day may be we jump in now may understand how this would work then how would they have access to so we have our own search server everything is channels through our cms which our development team manages how would they work together or would they have direct access okay how do you foresee this relationship kind of working
prospect,they'll have to get direct access that's that's the only way
prospect,is that normal for.you guys you guys usually have direct access to usually just main you usually work on test servers and you work with a development team to move things live or is your program basically permanently embedded into a live server and then the program is updated kind of walk me through how you kind of work with development jobson how do you guys stay on the same page
rep,so generally it's all on a staging environment so effectively the search context we build out is also on a staging environment that you are team test it out and then they do live for a feed system perspective generally we get the feed in one of these formats i usually told you they either put up on us on an smtp location or we do an api call to essentially pull out the most updated feed general workarounds is if you don't have in any of these formats then probably will have to write an api script to essentially pull out the feed directly but if you had already using the search server today i'm pretty sure it's being fed to the search server in some manner you just have to figure that out and then use it and essentially replicate something similar run on it we can we can do that either base but yeah we can talk to your tech to even figure out how this has to be done but there are multiple ways to do it.
prospect,then what's your typical on boarding time you mentioned four six weeks or something like that.
rep,yes so it again depends on which approach you take so impeded access some of the examples i showed you an express right so if i go and look for say jeans so essentially what the team has provided us is this header in this footer and this essentially is an mpd zacks htm injection we are managing all the search results we managing all the package filters every single thing is coming to unbxd.
rep,right this is much easier because you don't have to put any load on your development team we are building all the concepts on our end we take your inputs on how the auto suggest template should look like the only three things we need from you is the catalogue feed in any format you have we request you to install our analytics on day 1 and then you give us a page with a head there in the filter footer and impede of time so that's the only three things we need so this is much faster since the work is done by our team it's more predictable we can take things live in like a three week window the other approaches you want to do an api and open integration so we'll give you all the api's so your team would have to your development team needs to get involved on how do you actually call out these api is for all the calls that you have to make so that generally we've seen takes between four and five weeks because there is back-and-forth involved and hence it takes a little more time but we generally see nothing goes beyond six weeks including probably giving it a week for testing also so six weeks should be the maximum time to integrate.
prospect,and there's no money upfront there's there's no contracts it's proposed as a contract but the contract is based on usage and you said there's a test test case scenario and if you don't get to 10% improvement <>.
rep,correct so essentially the structure is there will be an implementation fee right which will be applicable if the contract is successful and then there will be monthly fee which you'll only start from month four right so effectively your first three months are at no cost yeah you already said that.
rep,we will still sing the contract we'll discuss pricing we'll discuss implementation cost everything will be outlined in a contract but effectively you don't have obligations for the first 90 days.
prospect,gotcha sounds good.
rep,yep <> again thank you so much so i will wait to hear from you our next steps and the <>.
rep,i'm good how are you i'm good thanks for asking and thank you for giving us a time to talk today.
prospect,sure i'm gonna get set up on the go to meeting i think it might be one thing for.
rep,you just share my screen slip you know once you can see that.
prospect,i have i have a i have a window in front of my screen and join the meeting as i don't know if i can get rid of that but i think i'm looking at your screen.
rep,does that say unbxd machine learning for site search.
prospect,yeah i just have this obstruction here with the pop-up window that's all i think that's on my end i don't think if i can try to.
rep,okay great so i am part of sales team unbxd prime-rely helped our sme customers onboarding with unbxd so in the solution how we can improve not just the site search experience for your customers on the side but also influence the revenue positive how we control a 10% up taking you in your conversion and hence the source revenue that is sue today and before i walk you through the unbxd solution.
rep,i want to quickly understand a little more about market and your business and say why customers buy from you right i'm sure there are many other sites out there selling similar products but there's always something unique about a business and that's why customers come to you and and buy from so if you can help me understand a little more about your business that that were kindly kind of you know help me understand what elements could be of more importance for you today through the over all site search.
prospect,okay well we are sort of a specialty market bit of a niche industry we deal mainly with architects woodworkers know workers it's like there's a i mean it's a pretty vast scope but it's um we we mainly sell hardware so it's like finishing touches for furniture . and there's not a whole lot of competition in the industry but there are some other <>  manufacturers things of that nature that that we do see as direct competitors so we would mostly be interested in refining the seo for certain keywords like for the parts of themselves so as an example i don't know if you're looking at our page any of those keywords along the left-hand side you know things like economics <> fire management or polls things of that nature so that would be that would be kind of i think the driving factor for getting people getting traffic to this site .
rep,well. right so that's that's your primary google search right what we help countries with is the products so once someone comes onto your site how do you ensure that they see the right set of products and they eventually that's where we help.
prospect,oh i see okay so like the internal search okay yeah we run on a magento platform but we are launching a new site very soon and we're incorporating binx search engine third party so that that should help clean it clear up the searches right now we have to sort of manually manipulate a lot of the data to give a suggested search this should give a better indication for whatever variables there may be in those search queries no but yeah i mean otherwise just breaking it down by it by segments by market segments by category that's kind of how we're doing it now to try to get them to what they're looking for.
rep,got it and and you said you're planning to use bing's if i'm not <> that's an open source so solution thats available out there.
rep,what you're trying to do
prospect,okay and i'm not i'm not that's not really my language or web developer as acting he's the one that initiated that with the evening.
rep,okay so that's where we come in to picture right we provide a site search platform right friendly prove this search experience of the site.
rep,and today we work with a lot of lot of large names in the industry like express ashley furniture store is one of our customer iv supplier they are a large b2b and say office supplies online retailer based out of new york.
rep,and the bottom line is not just improving the experience right and then where it becomes important is from a marketing perspective you know complete end up spending a lot of i would say budget on getting more traffic onto the site but where this marketing budget actually fails of the marketing initiative fail is the inability to convert because say a times are not able to show them the right products that the customer actually wants and the and the biggest impact of this is any person of such visitors who do not actually find the right products on the site leave the site right. they would think wrongly abandon the site thinking that you do not carry these products and and then and that's where we come in to picture obviously bings is an open source solution and there's a lot of manual effort required to kind of build this site solution and a lot of these enterprises actually have their own search team trying to build this for years but could not and that's why vendors like us and especially unbxd has been revolutionized is for last five years now on boarding of all of these customers helping them increase the revenue and the conversions and we actually give a contractual like to see the solution or say maybe show the solution to a larger group or to your team to understand the value that we would bring in on the table and then and we do this within the first 90 days right so we do a quick 90 day poc for our customers to test us to see at the actual increase in the conversions you like it you continue you do not like it you walk out with no questions and and that's that's what helps us engage get 1200+ global websites globally are our say it's 120 plus premium customer brands right here in the us and then we are onboarding a lot of a lot of b2b customers because in last 12 months we have seen drastic increase in in i would say understanding the importance of search for b2b businesses. earlier the thought was my customers knowing exactly what they want to buy they come to my site buy and walk out but now they do understand that that progress cookie is the key showing the right products is that you and that's what helps them improve the average or value the the conversion rates and.
rep,so curious if if you would want to see the demo now or is this something that you want to sort work another group in the company what what would be your thoughts.
prospect,we go to it you know i'm looking you know service and then relay that information on it of entry.
rep,sure so are you seeing my screen right now it is about us and then i have some few of our customers out there able to see that.
rep,okay so here are some of our customers from fashion we work with express they are already live with us rue 21 1200 plus stores large online presence with over 50 million in revenue they are in implementation we are going live with a hhgreg after the holiday season we are done with the poc the offline poc and the court fees so they wanted us to take them life post december the 1st week of jan but the others the scotia sylvain they are all live ib supply live on the only hardware or home improvement site have you worked with ashley furniture store bed bath and beyond is something isn't in implementation the move fabric snob we are are something which are again live.
rep,with regards of platforms you mentioned that your movie moon took on the new site to magento that is also going to be a magento ok fine so we do have a plugin for magento but irrespective in future if you plan to move to a different ecommerce platform our solution is platform agnostic we can integrate in with any e-commerce platform we've magento ibm shopify bigcommerce or even an in-house custom. here here is something that i wanted to show after we went live with express the ceo himself went out to mention us during the q2 earnings call and that was because of the drastic increase in the conversion that we made substantial increase in the conversion that they saw in the first quarter of using unbxd search solution. and here is the here is something that i just spoke about right jupiter researcher actually say 80% of the visitors will abandon aside after the poor search experience and that's probably because how how these users are habitual of searching products on google and amazon and every time they search for something they surely get the relevant results that they are probably looking for and that's what they expect the e-commerce sites to also behave like and if the site doesn't and then they would just walk out. here is a quick snapshot of before and after this is primarily for express blue jeans this is how it to look like and today this is solitude it looks like for blue jeans as a query and and the elements that we bring to the table are machine learning personalization and context search and towards the rest of the demo i will walk you through all of these elements living more in detail but a quick snapshot in terms of what we are talking about and how and and what the kind of experience that we believe we can we can create for any e-commerce retailer. here are some high-level stats in terms of how we helped customers within the first 90 days to positively impact the conversion rates or their revenue ultimately what what everyone is looking at is increasing.
rep,furniture and home decor that's actually for ashley furniture store a drastic increase of say 30 percent in their revenue within the first 90 days of going live. then fashion the atg is actually expressed thirty five percent increase in revenue the the max that we saw was for a catalog company and we're in an nda so sorry i cannot give you or the name for this catalog company but yes we saw a hundred three percent increase in the revenue and there was the other reason primarily for for such an increase was their search really sucked it was really very bad whereas for some of the others they had spent a lot of time they had improved the search but then there were still gaps that we could come in and fill in and show the positive i would say up taken in conversions and revenue and what they paid is just 110 or even lesser at times of what they actually made in terms of revenue after adding unbxd site search any any question before i'm over ahead.
rep,so i spoke about us and then before i show you the solution what i want i did is i spend some time on your site i identified a few i would say elements or few opportunities where if we feel we can come in and make a difference right how we can improve the experience of site today and then this is not to criticize your work or anyone's work at the company today i know you're here amping the side you know the elements on search but thought a lot walking through by taking very specific use cases on your site how they are today and how we can i would say improve them so hope that's fine . awesome so what i'm going to focus on today is autosuggest a smart machine learning driven
rep,autopilot approach which is visual in nature helps you expose the right products to a customer from the very first few alphabets that will start typing in the search box error tolerance right how how we manage error tolerance spell check stemming issues on the site contextual relevancy that's where the elizabeth ii of what the customer is searching for they do see the most relevant results this improves our increases the probability of them converting then u i a few elements on on ui merchandising do you.
prospect,do you have a merchandiser team today.
prospect,what i have.
rep,do you have we have a team of merchandisers boots and merchandise the site.
rep,okay but we do have them the the back and merchandising dashboard i can either skip it for to us call through the high-level elements but if there are set of people internalize the website for better results we do have a back in dashboard and then overall the infrastructure right and we not only give you an sla on i would say the performance of the site which could be say the site speed up time but we also have an sla with regards to the the increasing in revenue increasing conversions and this could be contractual slas in is in terms of how much increase you would see in ninety days in one year of using unbxd . so the first element that i you get on his site was autosuggest when i start typing on the search box it actually does not guide me does not expose the right set of products and then there are various different ways in terms of how you can start guiding the customers from the first few alphabets and they start typing on the site and let me actually show you some of the life-sized just flip my screens here and show you some of the live customers and some of these customers might not be from your industry but i wanted to show in terms of how customized the solution can be based on customers site search being so intrinsic something that works for sears does not work for jcpenney something that works yes if any might not work for express right so we understand each and every customers challenge and there unique business proposition and then we customize a few of these elements. so if you see my screen parts warehouse you see that.
rep,okay so paths warehouse they primarily sell vacuum cleaner parts and other home appliance parts they have two kinds of visitors on the side today one who knows exactly what part number to buy and others who know what model number right and before we came in they actually used
rep,okay so parts warehouse they primarily sell vacuum cleaner parts and other home appliance parts.
rep,they have two kinds of visitors on the side today one who knows exactly what part number to buy and others who know what model number right and before we came in they actually used to have two different search boxes that they used to use i'm just trying to see if i could i can find that link but yeah what what they had was two different search boxes and the onus was completely on the customer to choose the right search box may be by partner or by model number no we came in and we said what if customer chooses the wrong search they would not be guided to the right product this is obviously if you see mystery in search hence we came in and we built something like this the moment i start typing in the bissel now on the left hand side you see all the parts for bissel on the right hand side you see all the models for bissel and some of the top searches for the same. here is another customer of ours which is tactical they selll has the most popular brand some of the most popular categories within nike nike easy night vision night 9 line apparel of the other brands and their categories which are popular some of the top queries starting with ni on the right hand side start showing me some of the nike popular products not just that say if this week this 4th black boot became more popular then this boot would go on top and others would come down the order depending on the popularity and that's that's where the machine learning kind of kicks in tries to understand the user behavior and then collects a lot of analytics across the site by every each and every visitor that comes onto the site per product per query and then and starts manipulating these results trying primarily promoting all the mooting products based on the probability of them converting. here is another example for express say the moment i start typing g shows me because for expresses a brand what was important was categories so say jeans for men women with rice blue in legging now here you see red jeans again based on popularity based on based on the crowd behavior on the site right last week when i was doing this demo it used to be a blue jeans but it looks like christmas is bringing in red jean popularity on top and that's why red jean on top fo men in slim in slim as what does showing up here right.
rep,and the last example that i actually want to show you is big basketcom.
rep,again i know this is not from your from your vertical but one kind of show the breadth of the customization of the solution primarily based on the customer they're the second largest grocery store in apac and and the then the challenge was they had a lot of repeat visitors people buying same products in there each grocery run right buying fifteen twenty products and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search for these products go to the pdp page add to cart and then check out. so instead what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in chicken shows me all the options for chicken it shows me the delivery options for chicken gives me the ability to increased quantity right here from search box and add to cart right here from search box so on the commonly searched terms popular brands and categories and that the customer can choose from the marketing team starts promoting some of the products by adding banners right here in the search box for this particular category or for this particular query also. not just that if we added personalization to it because they have a lot of repeat customers say if i was buying chicken nuggets more often i would see chicken nuggets on top but if you as a customer of buying masala chicken more often and you would see masala chicken on top any questions is this something that you think might help at market.
prospect,oh maybe obviously increase giving you all this different you know different filtering criteria it might be a little specific like you know where you had all those different versions of nikes and like blue jeans and that's what like this this is really cool for their for their purposes i certainly think ours needs some help you know as you pointed out it's you know there's not there's not a lot of we don't have any sort of filtering options at all but the results that they yield are not necessarily specific to or we did we don't have any sort of learning capabilities like the behavioral pattern yes i mean that's great i don't know in terms of like implementing it this would be more something for our web developers off static and i can talk to him about it but.
prospect,what are the cost associated with it like to the launch and the host  it.
rep,so this is auto suggestion system just one piece of the overall solution right there are a lot more drug discovery elements that we sloved starting from auto suggest to error tolerance to i would say the core strength being relevancy and from from marketing i actually pulled up something for you actually i want to show you that right so i was.
prospect,this taking to account misspelling.
rep,yes so i would go there back again but but what i wanted to show you was right there was a particular query countertop support legs and if i do that today on google you show up on top right because this is a <> google screen if you see my screen they see the presentation. okay so this is what i get on google if i click on it i get a neatly i would say categorized reserve set right the right page as a customer that i would want to look at right so this is something that the marketing piece is - now say as a customer i come onto your site because of various different reasons i saw this page the next time i remember market i directly come to market or there was another email campaign i come to market and if i
rep,search for countertop support legs here are the results that i see a lot of them being non relevant some of them not even being support legs right these are surely not supporting it these are some sort of keyboard platforms right some of the i think these are some sort of grommets maybe but primarily non-relevant results now now as a customer i i feel that you do not have enough countertop support legs and i would move i would go back to google or i would go back to amazon or any other site and look for the right set of products and i might be interested right . so this is where i spoke about the gap right so the marketing is doing their job right that they're able to get the traffic or to the side but what happens when there is there is other organic traffic coming on the site are you able to convert and and that's where we come in the picture and we help you improve the conversion rate for these kind of customers who come on to your site and search for problems.
rep,so so this is this is one example on the on the relevancy i looked at say hideaway collection right you have around seventy three items under the hideaway collection but when i search for hideaway collections it only gives me 12 i'd surely you not the best set of results that i as a customer would want to look at you would want to show it right here are some examples from our customer ivy supply right you see the search query almost four words black logitech wireless keyboard and they are showing all logitech wireless keyboards which are available any black. pride air 69 ounce spray bottle almost six words search query shows the most relevant results there are only two results shown and they have the they are the relevant results that's exactly what customer wants and then you're able to bring that up on top and so the right element reserves for the customers to quickly buy . another another thing on google i think this was metal grommets that i was looking for if i was to do that on google you again show up on first page takes me to the right set of products but when i search for metal grommets on the site it actually says that you have none that's the gap that we fill in. here is another example.
prospect,i didnt know that.
rep,yes exactly and the challenge is someone is to sit and see this right and and we and we are so swamped with some of the other projects some of the other priorities that that we don't realize that we might be losing customers right the end up spending a lot in marketing in increasing the traffic but are we converting them and and we come in and say with your current marketing spend with no additional marketing spend with your current traffic that you bring onto the side we will take your revenues up by say 10% other conversion rates up by 10% right. and and that's where you will be able to optimize all your marketing spend by increasing the conversions right because there is a there is there is a limit to how much you can you can spend in terms of marketing to bring more traffic right and if you are not converting the traffic it actually doesn't make sense to add that any more traffic on the other site and then and that's that's the most important. here are some more examples and i looked at aluminum knob these are some of them are not even knobs they're probably aluminum products somewhere in the product description it would say aluminium and that just pulls out right the system today is not able to understand that knob is actually a product and aluminum is the material for that particular product and you'll notice that on express how we have saw that full sleeve office ware for women i would say black v-neck for women right and the system is able to automatically understand that women is the gender a v-neck is the style black is the color. and that's what is looking for we understand the intent of the customer here is another example from ib supply i i notice that you do not have a sorting option on the site times you would want to give the customer the ability to sort products right especially when when a search results page returns say 100 products if i'm looking for grommets and you have hundreds of grommets and now i want to look for the cheapest grommet or the cheapest metal grommet you would you would want the customer to be able to filter that sort that especially through the price option. it would be low to high or high to low that is another functionality that you can add on your site.
rep,some of the non product search terms right i look for shipping and delivery and i see you have a category or a tab that says shipping and delivery but if as a customer i was trying to search i was trying to type and see i'm looking looking for a for an e-commerce site that can deliver products in say 48 hours right. so out of my i just come onto the site and start looking at your shipping policy and your delivery policy try to type shipping and delivery shipping and delivery this is exactly how it is on your site today then i look for delivery everything returns products doesn't take me to your shipping and delivery page right. only the word shipping if i was to look for just shipping it does take you to your shipping and delivery page but anything outside of that does not take me there same thing with returns you do have a guaranteed returns page but if i was to search for returns that's not take me anywhere does not show me a return policy and here are few examples in terms of how you can also address some of the nonprofit search and it's not just the shipping and returns policy at times companies also have a lot of content on the site a lot of educational material on the site that their readers come and and read right and then eventually if they like something they end up buying so we can also make that content searchable.
rep,so do you have any content you power any content on the site today.
prospect,to have any content what now .
rep,on the site today that people read or search for say it could be blogs or any other sort of content.
prospect,oh sure yeah whitey i mean you could search for anything really you could say table a problem like that but i think what's what's happening just as watching you pull up these different search results i think we have a native search engine and i think it's only pulling data from one field there's a product description field and i think that's the only place like so this probably says in the description there you know available you know or something about the terms for the shipping for the delivery something something in that nature.
rep,i completely agree.
prospect,and that's not taking into account of their length and i know you're critical i just i'm trying to figure this why not you know give me right results.
rep,in the search language what we do what we call it is it that's fixed pattern match right and that's right in the search algorithms were saying and these were primarily built for document search right how you can search document and then and the typical way of doing it was text patent match so say if if i was to search for drawers for keyboard the the search engine starts looking for the words drawers for and keyboard and wherever this say see these words most
prospect,sorry can you hear me you're cutting in and out.
rep,hey belly i think billi this sort of you can hear me.
prospect,yeah i can hear you you cut out for.
rep,you know i think i yeah i think i ashish lost start i just get him back one quick moment.
rep,billy can you hear me.
prospect,i can hear you now.
rep,okay awesome i think i lost i think 30 seconds i lost my internet so i was talking about the text pattern match right what's happening is looks for drawers and then wherever drawers as the word is used most often will just come and that kind of works for a document search but not for the product search of the e-commerce search in the e-commerce industry you need to understand the intent of the customers so say an example that we use very often is brown leather jacket right. brown is the color leather is the is the material and jacket is the actual product so we understand understand that we have we tune the system per cat law to understand that jacket is actually the product so only thing that we are going to now show this jacket then leather is the material so we are looking for all jackets which are made of and.
prospect,are you there.
rep,yes i'm here sorry.
prospect,we're losing you again
rep,billy i guess i lost him give me one quick moment.
rep,ashish are you there. yes i'm i'm back i just logged in from phones so that we don't have this problem again great yes so we have created a system or an or a search engine that is contextual aware that is able to understand the intent of the customer right just like in brown leather jacket we understand that the jacket is the product is it the material brown is the products some of these which are not grommets but maybe they are products which work well with related items right they're being pushed on top but actual product that the customer is looking for his grommets and you would want to show grommets and various different kind of grom grommets and push the ones which are for desk on top. same thing say we solve this for parts warehouse small brush belt for the same bissell is the model and small brush belt is the product that someone is looking for then i look for a a long tail query right and by a long tail query is because the conversion rates on a long tail for you are very high but the customers are very clear right the queries are typically long so let me give you an example right i as in a match amateur i come to come onto your site and i look for grommets right now i'm not very clear what kind of grommets life i need a more in that explorer face and i start looking at me the different gromets. but then when someone comes in and looks for say aluminium grommet which is say 3 inch width and i'm just making it up but then someone comes and looks for that kind of a query meaning they're very clear in terms of what product they want and if you can understand that in turn and show them the right product they would immediately convert. that's different and that's where some of these long tail queries become very very important because the conversion rate here can be i can i can i can guarantee you could be 40 to 50 percent higher than whatever your overall conversion rates are so i look for polished aluminum furniture legs but you do have few products actually under furniture legs which are in which appalled finishes the polished aluminum when i was trying to look for that some of these are not even furniture legs this is something that we solved for say express just an example dresses on sale for some of the customers we took go to another level say i go on to a site and look for christmas gifts for toddlers there is no product in that has been mentioned.
rep,you need to understand that it's for toddlers something that can be gifted on christmas right and then we understand the catalog and we start showing the right toddlers products which can also be gifted. theme based winter jackets expensive suits for men right what does the word expensive mean here it's surely not part of the description surely not part of the of the catalogue but the search engine is automatically able to understand that expensive means something that's that's high in price so let's let's push the products which are higher in price on top. here is a quick example for head query search wire management on left hand side you do have wire management as a category so that was to click on it it will start showing me all of these million different products for wire managers you have again two different sub categories that you have but when when i click on wire management shows me 45 products the onus is on the customer to start looking at various products. here is an approach that we follow and this is just again an example this can be took the idea is we have the technology to identify the most relevant categories for a head query search and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity. and we do not wait for customer to click on something and immediately start showing products which are more popular or i would say the category which is more popular or relevant right in this case mobile mobile being more popular are relevant each star is showing mobile's still giving consumers the ability to browse through various steps and categories mobile head phones mobile cases or covers bluetooth headsets over a period of time say if people are taking more on mobile cases or covers this becomes more popular this comes on position two and and mobile phones goes on positions any any questions.
prospect,no no go ahead.
rep,i think this i misses spellcheck that's another thing that i wanted here was the spellcheck element. so i try to make you few mistakes while typing with typically use a behavior when they're coming from smaller screens or when they're trying to type fast and then then to make these simple mistakes a spelling mistake so say grommet with signal m gives me a few words person leather handles because i misspelled leather it still shows me some handles obviously the first one is not andle but shows me some other handles these two handles but not the leather handles you have a good section or a subcategory for leather handles wich would have been i would say showed here for this particular query then i misspelled brackets in panel brackets some of them are brackets but they're coming up because of the word match of panel and the others are surely not brackets right these are these are grommets sort of. so with us what we've built is a spellcheck algorithm which can automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word and that's that's the strength of the spellcheck algorithm.
rep,ib supply sanitizer with an f instead of t automatically corrected it. here is another example from express.
rep,black leather jacket all three misspelled there is actually one alphabet missing in all three words off of the query we immediately autocorrect it and start showing the results without waiting for the customer to click onto something and 85 to 90% of your misspelled queries will automatically be corrected now at times the pushback that you might get from your development team is that they would come back and say oh we can look at the reports we can identify what are being misspelled most often and we can correct them but forgetting that say a 7 alphabet word can be misspelled in a million ways a b when a customer comes misspells doesn't see results leave the site right that experience from that customer is lost right you wait for one week for 100 such customers to have a bad experience then run a report and start building redirects or correcting them and it's too late so it needs to be automated that you do not need manual resources or running reports to understand these challenges and start correcting. same thing with stemming write the knob overseas knobs of plural my intent again doesn't change i am primarily looking for knobs for not you show me some knobs here which is okay but but for knobs with an s doesn't written any knob just one product some sort of drill guide but not other. same thing i look for steel door pulls and then i look for stainless steel doors stainless steel door pulls is also something and that's pop that you're popular for in on on google here you'll see the set of results are totally different whereas the intent of the customer is the same and and the idea is right respite of what the customer is typing like we'd say for express t-shirt t-shirts with an s and with an hyphen t-shirts without the hyphen or even tees where the commonly used synonymous words for t-shirt. the the technology should be able to understand it and start showing the most relavant results then i look at your sites of speed typically the industry standard is anything less than 300 milliseconds let's consider to be something that's not visible to human eye right and then that's that's what the industry standard is usually measured or is used to measure these the site speeds right. i looked at your site looks like crosses more than 200 percent either is over 200 % over first some of the path right for not central typically very smooth faster on the western side of the gumption line so this is another thing that you would want to look at in terms of improving the experience of the customer here is something that we tested with express this was this was on black friday i would say the heavy traffic day the most busy day of the year and you'll see all all four regions remain within the 300 milli second industry standard.
rep,so these were primarily the few elements what we can also do is we can also add filters on your site so i was curious you said you do not have a lot of filtering options is that the choice of design or is that a limitation in in your product catalog field in terms of how your data is today i would say configured for.
prospect,we we considered the option and we just really need to refine you know the criteria like there's probably things that we could do i finished by size by christ even we don't list the price right there on the on the the image product page you have to click into it see it so i don't even know if that would even be helpful but there are probably some that we could you know some filters that we've been add we just we've not found the right formula yet so . disable that option.
rep,okay. got it so with us you can't surely do that you can get set filters you can also set filters per category like meaning say for <> and the category you can set a particular set of filters now irrespective of how someone searches for grommets could be metal grommets wooden grommets just grommets and they might come and misspelled grommets which might get autocorrect it as far as there's 75% on more results are from a particular category that being fake or omits the grommets filters automatically kick in and that's what we call dynamic first facets that's one the second thing in your cases it makes more interesting is not sure what what filters you would want to show and in which order you would want to slow so we make the make the filters again dynamic to the next level then even say within grommets you would have five filters right here in this case they agenda size type fit availability right it's the right order for for this particular filter we are not sure right so we leave it on machine learning say this is how you have it on day one but but on day ten people are clicking more often on price as  filter right. the machine learning algorithm is able to understand that and automatically boost the price filter and bring it up on top way to figure out the best way some . some companies want to do that some companies don't so express has their own own way of you know like as a foreign enterprise they have their own way of presenting this so they do not have a dynamic filter in terms of the ordering of this particular filter side and even even for the sub filters they have it based on the count on the product counter and a lot of times they want the most product count to be on top and that's how they typically show but then we have the ability to even say within the flame casual or or or say modern right why would you want this in this order so we leave this up to machine learning if people are clicking more on more often on the straight we bring that on top automatically and then others down the order so even within the filter right even first filters we can do that it is typically used for brands when you have multiple brands you have 100 brands that you carry which brand you would want to show on.
prospect,right yeah i wouldn't that wouldn't apply to us but i mean this simple filtering like so we can write the everybody .
rep,can we can surely activate those as well and then one of the important thing is this zero result page right this is what i see on on your site when i get the zero result page right and there could be various reasons of fitting of usual but even after using unbxd and the reason could be say you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or the search query is so butchered that is really difficult for an automated system to understand it in that case we believe that the onus is on the <> on us to start guiding the customer whenever they encounter it is or something. and we do this in real time highly personalized for each user on the side right we put two visitors here recently viewed and recommendations recently viewed as a product that they would have looked at on your site during during the time spent and now based on their affinity towards a particular brand color style price point right depending on your product catalog feed people who would see what attribute to get what kind of image but based on based on their activity on the site what kind of product they have been looking at we start recommending products in real time which they would be more probable to buy right. now this gives the recently viewed gives the ability to go back in the broad journey and recommendations gives them the ability to move ahead in their product journey any questions so far there's one more of these i would say the features of the of the solution so far just wanted to know if this is something that you like not like.
prospect,no and i think there's just great features here definitely want to talk to our web team about you know okay i think really at this point what i'm concerned about is you know or concern about those interested in knowing is the hosting price is it a monthly fee is it this is just a setup fee like what are the costs associated with.
rep,so we do a 90-day poc
rep,so you pay for for the three months to us right that's your three month monthly fee and and the monthly fee primarily depends on your web traffic and that is also typically under search traffic do you have any statistics in terms of what your search sessions look like today.
prospect,yeah i can give you an idea google analytcs here.
rep,yeah google analytics and i think there's something called user behavior where you will see sessions with so send out search
prospect,with session users page views what what information which name.
rep,i need the sessions with such research.
prospect,that under session behavior.
rep,i mean the behavior i'm not wrong that's on the behavior.
prospect,is there a search query that i can put in to find that like i'm in the behavior section looking at all pages i don't.
rep,all pages do
prospect,you want me to i know that you i do you want me to give you the present of you and i can maybe see a screen and guide you.
rep,on one second
prospect,do you have a sample page that you can just throw up on the screen i can put .
rep,sure in one moment on the left hand side it is typically user behavior and then when you go under user behavior is something called a search .
prospect,yeah like overview behavior flow like content site search .
rep,yeah site search.
prospect,okay those zeros here session.
rep,okay you see zero there probably this is not yet adaptive with it because i know that there is some sort of google analytics setting that you need to do to start tracking this number  so what is the track yes she has probably not actively tracking it.
rep,what is the total sessions and i can maybe estimated.
rep,total session i should be on the i think the home page under the traffic.
prospect,the last 30 days it's sessions wise ninety eight thousand six hundred twenty three users seventy three thousand six hundred seventy five .
rep,so we looking at sessions can you average it for like say 90 days or 120 days three to four hundred i'm sure yeah anywhere about three months so that we are you know i would say it skipping any any peaks and stufts because of the holiday season or any other.
prospect,okay well you know from september 12 for today one hundred eighty thousand users two hundred seventy two thousand sessions.
rep,hundred and eighty.
prospect,users yeah.
rep,and the session yeah we're talking about session.
prospect,sessions  272 and change.
rep,so you're pretty much in 100 hundred thousand ballpark right and yeah in yeah and in the in your kind of industry what we see the search traffic to be is anywhere on the lower side could be 25% and the higher side being up to fifty percent fifty percent is like very i was a very minimal very less number of retailers a tv but i would say you would still fall in between thirty to forty percent so we're looking at around thirty to forty thousand searches sessions a month and reverse.
rep,a forty thousand search sessions a month the kind of price that we are looking at for the first 90 days poc it's going to be i would say $2000 a month that is $6000 for three months that's what you test a solution for isn't that 90 days we do the setup we take you live right our implementation time is anywhere between for the six weeks we work with you and your team in terms of getting access getting feedback understanding what your business requirements could be so that we can implement those.
rep,but the complete coding implementation that burden is something that that's on our team if you do not include your coders we do not include your developers on a day-to-day development work post development right before we are ready to take it live you would hand over the test environment to you for internal testing right i am sure you would want to test something before they eat so that's where you need some involvement with you and your team but pretty quick i would say 10% of the work at your end 90% of the work at our end to take the site live and to implement the site search solution and we have very specific set metrics such as success mentoring as well these i would say nine areas poc and that typically builds downs in terms of in terms of the increase in conversion and driven right so they'll come in and say within 90 days you should be being x percentage increase in conversion and x percent increase in revenue and post 90 days if you do not see that you can surely walk out without any any commitments to unbxd.
prospect,okay and you said the set-up time is like four to six weeks.
rep,four to six weeks so on the high side for six weeks and then so the first 12 weeks you will get six weeks off set up and the other six weeks will be we'll take the site live we'll continue to tune the system even on on live traffic and then ensuring that end of that over all i would say 90 days of poc you see the desired results.
prospect,okay all right well this is good info and i will long and heavier now that i have the invitation i had contacted for.
rep,surely but i can go ahead and share this deck with you would that help you about this information internally.
prospect,okay yeah that'd be helpful.
rep,right i'll do that is there anything else you would need to kind of show the solution to it.
prospect,no i
rep,think this is pretty thorough obviously there's some super helpful features here so i'm gonna i did i did grab a couple of screenshots while you were going so i have i have some reference okay so i appreciate that thank you very much show the demo so yeah maybe if you want to follow up with me in a later date that's fine i'm gonna pass this like we're yeah we're in the midst of the new news night development now and i have our our hands full which with that but it you know when when it gets closer to launch the.
prospect,when when it gets closer to launch the.
rep,so when you planned like take the site live the new site live.
prospect,we're shooting for next month actually
rep,next month oh that's awesome that's awesome i'm just curious given us you're taking it's like next month site would you want to parallel try and run a poc so when you go live like you go with the good site search solution on board on the site and not wait for that first month or second month and this typically happens right. because the site goes live there could be lot of other bugs right not adhere to fixing the priorities for the team shifts don't even try to do this battle you don't lose an opportunity you don't lose a revenue on a month on month basis so so.
rep,i'm just curious if if they if you were to explore a possibility of doing a parallel poc so that people live with your new site what could be the next steps whom came who could we show the solution and see if this is something that would make sense maybe maybe to a larger group to your development team or maybe someone who heads your ecommerce business today or the online business today.
prospect,yes i think that's a good point you know point taken in terms of isn't getting the bugs cleaned out before we miss the opportunity with you know with with service but we'll kind of have to just play that by year see how once we roll it out the house functionality is it's performing and then kind of revisit that so it might not be something that we would do right away but i think it might be a good idea for the future so we'll kind of reconnect at that point but you can just you can just talk to me directly i'll pass the info along and now we can show necks at that point.
rep,sure sounds good i'll pass this in for any tentative timeline timeline for us to go kind of follow-up if you don't hear back from you a week to week what what do you think would be the best time for us to follow through and see where you are.
prospect,yeah a couple of weeks we'll be fine you
rep,awesome sounds good all right.
prospect,yeah thanks ashish
rep,nice talking to you and thank you thank you for your time to show our solutions today.
prospect,okay take care. all right thanks a lot
rep,industries so that you get the breadth of customization we do right so this is a customer called parts warehouse i'm not sure if you've seen this example before. this this this was how their site looked like they were on x topia in 2014 2013 was actually moved on to unbxd this is how the site looked like what you would notice distinctly on the site is the presence of two search boxes right because the business case they had was they had two kinds of customers one customer who exactly knew which partner to buy and the other customer who came in and looked for information  <through a martini>.
rep,and at a back end the way they had structured the databases was these two information was present in two different indexes and the thought having two search boxes was the easiest way to solve the problem. but the problem here is now you are actually putting the onus back on the customer they're expecting the customer to pick the right search box and we all know how difficult it is to optimize for a single search experience but in this case we have to optimize for two different search experiences. when we came in in 2013 the first thing we told them is okay let's have retain a single search experience and will optimize and customize the autocomplete for your business use case.
rep,today if you start typing in the cell what you notice is on one side you see parts the other side you will see model names plus we also have a recommendation widget which basically tells you on the top search queries for something starting with b i s s right so this way we customize their business case with the use of our technology.
rep,the second example i want to show you is this company called us patriot they're roughly about a fifty five million dollar retailer in the midwest they sell military apparel to non-military personnel and they had two specific business cases.
rep,one was they had a fairy large catalog and the problem was people easily come and find a brand like nike and buy it buy a shoe from nike but they also have some of these niche products which build and make and manufacture these military uniforms which are not very well known. so they wanted the autocomplete to be more guided to also show products which are sure products and brands which are not well-known but once the user starts using them he or she will start loving it plus they had a lot of very expensive products and they wanted a fairly good visual view of all that popular products with images. so the way we built the autocomplete for them is the moment you start typing n i where i probably intend to type in nike a it will show me the brand nike and it will show me that these three are the three most popular category of boots in nike. it will also tell me that there's something called as nite glow gear and nine line apparel which probably i would have never known if had not looked at this autocomplete so that it gives me a visual into the long tail of the site it also tells me what are my top search queries for something starting with n i and you would also see all the popular products.
rep,if you would have observed if you look at example one and two the autocomplete is completely customized it's not like we have built an autocomplete template and if you have a thousand customers for all the thousand customers that look the same it's completely customized to make sure that your business case and your business differentiator is highlighted. and for a customer whose first experience on your site is your search box you want to give him a very differentiated experience.
rep,the third example very very different this is an online grocer they're actually the largest online grocer in southeast asia they were in the news last week because there is over 150 million dollars in a series b funding i guess.
rep,they had again a specific use case two of them actually one on an average their analytics told them that a customer would buy about 18 to 20 products in a single transaction so they wanted a way in which people can add to cart in the fastest possible manner. and secondly for people who go and buy grocery regularly they end up buying the same products like i would probably go back and buy chicken egg and milk every week so they wanted to a feature in the autocomplete itself where the search options can also be personalized to me as a user versus you as a user. so the way we accomplish this is if you start typing in chicken on the site what you would notice is we've given the option to change quantity and add add the product right from the autocomplete experience itself plus we show a banner for any offer on the top plus we show them the commonly searched terms the popular brands for chicken and the popular categories of chicken. and to manage the personalization aspect if i am a user who would buy chicken without skin chicken without skin will show up on top for me and if you buy chicken with skin and you show up on top for you.
rep,again completely different from the last two examples you actually saw did this make sense.
prospect,yeah it's fantastic i think it it seems like it's i mean i don't even know what i would honestly i don't even know what i would do with all those different options.
rep,no no i'm and that's our job to make sure when we do an implementation call it's it's more about understanding your business requirement because that's ties in back into a philosophy michael. because we as of today know that we've built a kick-ass product but being in the bay area where we also know that somebody else would come and kick our ass in six months or a year from now so it's just not technology that will make all the difference beyond technology it's about people right i have to come on board i have to tell you that this is how we can come and help you increase revenue right. and you will have to tell me okay this is what i think we can do to increase our revenue and we have to work together so it's that business relationship and making sure that the great product we have fits into your specific requirements. because your needs are very different from mine or anybody else and if you didn't have a business differentiator people wouldn't have come onto your site they would have probably gone to amazon and bought everything they wanted but there is a reason why people come out to your site and we want to understand that reason.
rep,and data will tell us and give us a lot of insights and we have to start making those intelligent decisions with the strength of data and design and make sure that the experience of a user on your site is fantastic right and when we mean frame work from a philosophical standpoint what we mean is probably today you understand all the challenges in your business. but 12 months from now if you want to open up say a new category that's where we can come in with our wealth of experience in working with a diverse set of 1200 retailers and we can come in on day one and tell you michale this is what will i think you have to do from a product discovery standpoint so that for your new category you can start seeing good conversions from day one. and that's effectively how we work with every single customer you can you can talk to who are amir about that he's been working with us on a few customers as well it's a very very personal approach that we take and all our solutions are customized though it's customized it does not mean that we take six months to implement. we implement this in product in two to three weeks and we will also make sure that it captures all these subtle variations that we believe will start enhancing user experiences i'm not sure if i mad sense i generally have a habit of talking too much so.
prospect,no no that's okay better talk too much that's not enough.
rep,okay great so yeah this is to reiterate the autocomplete which is the first feature of search i wanted to share with you on the second feature i want to talk about is the entire relevancy aspect right because relevancy is a very very tough term and a problem to resolve. so what we did is before we started building out the platform we we went through a lot of stuff especially on how people search for products on any e-commerce site and a common trend came across and i would send you a white paper on this as well basically if you look at any kind of search query on any retail site it will kind of fall into one of these 12 buckets right. people would go onto an e-commerce site and probably search by a part number they might search by a model name they might search by an exact product type and i'd go and search by a theme like say a party shoes or a formal trouser or they might actually go and search by natural language if i'm naive when i don't know what to look for your site i'll probably just randomly go and say lights at $100 right. i mean people put them when they put any random stuff on google they actually get some fairly relevant results and they expect every retail site to perform in the same way but it's it's a classic spoilt for choice problem right.
rep,so what we did is we identified these 12 buckets and we started building out algorithm which are the foundation to our platform to starts resolving to each of these queries to at least like a 90-95 percentile so that we know that most of the questions and queries are the people that a first user will end up in putting on a search box gets resolved in the best possible relevance and since we built this as foundational our search is very different because our search is more contextual. if you have to go to any of the unbxd site if you're probably one of our apparel covered side and if you go and type and say a black leather jacket water our big data system in the back and we'll understand is jacket is the product product type leather is a fabric attribute and black is a color attribute hence it starts resolving for these things automatically understanding the context and hence our error tolerance is so high. so if you look at this example the same black leather jacket i have misspelt each of these three words incorrectly but since we do contextual relevance the system understands this means black leather jacket it is not only show you the option if there are more than one option it will show you all the two two or three option. and it also starts displaying the results right from the this word book and this is what i was telling you that you don't have to go and build a synonym corpus at your back end to correct for these things the system should be intelligent enough to correct itself similarly with stemmed words the system understands dress dresses wood wooden shoe shoes light lights are all the same and it will not only resolve it it will also start showing these consistent results right.
rep,so in our system there is no requirement for you to go and build a synonym for any stemmed words any singular plural or any synonym right only you will have to go and build a synonym and we'll give you three ways to build a synonym it would be unidirectional bi-directional or placement if there is something very specific to your industry and i'll show you on the dashboard as to how easy is it for you to build synonym as well right. the other feature that we run in search so we spoke about autocomplete we spoke about relevancy some of the other elements and relevancy these are all finer variations but we believe it will start making the huge difference when you take it as a whole one of them is auto automated redirect right. today you don't have to go and start manually configuring rules where if i look for something which you also have a category with the same name the ideal thing for me to do is to be redirected to the category because that's where i'll find the most relevant search results and this is something that we do in an automated way. another ui element that we manage if i come and search for a specific query on your site especially considering your home decor or if i probably just put on lights on your search box there might be multiple products that might actually match the word lights right.
rep,and especially in these cases from a ui perspective it would be nice for a user if he can actually horizontally scope the subcategories of this specific keyword do a category scope and vertically start showing all the products and this section can be completely customized. where if after 30 days of machine learning on your site if the system recognizes that say in this case a bluetooth is more popular than a headphone then a bluetooth that actually appear before a headphone right. similarly we can do bucketed search results as well typical horizontal and vertical scoping right and another important thing on facets and filters i'll take you through a live example as well you can do this at a query level if you figure that men's casual shoes is a popular query on your site and if you define a specific set of attributes for them. once you set this up then you can basically say men formal shoes men party shoes it does not even have to have the word shoes in it it could be men's nike men adidas the results will appear with the same attributes.
rep,you change the vertical another query you define or category men casual shirts you define a specific set of attributes for this category once you set this up then you can search for men formal shirts men casual shirts men's tommy hilfiger men's ralph lauren the attributes will appear in the same format.
rep,and our search our multi select search will work extremely fast if i give you an example in us patriot if you see my screen now so i just go and select police and duty and you would see multiple filters that they're actually defined for police and duty section multiple facets of design right this is an ajax implementation we've done which generally guarantees a sub 20 millisecond response time. if you just see i just clicked on side zip boots i looked at 511 tactical as a band i looked at black as a color i said width should be regular i said shoe size of six i look at height six inch i look at price between hundred and hundred twenty-five.
rep,so look at the number of attributes i've actually chosen to drill down to exactly what i want to see and look at how fast it loads the same multi-select filters that you can enable and define on a desktop also works seamlessly on a mobile device as well i should have a snapshot of that i'll show that to you while we go along. any questions michael.
prospect,no it's a little a little overwhelming on the amount of work that that we would have to implement on top of what you do so.
rep,no honestly there's very little that you would have to do even even this platform as a foundation we'll start doing better even if you don't do anything for the first three months just with the relevancy aspect mdi.
prospect,so you're saying that we would for the for three months we would just let it learn.
rep,you don't have to do anything even then it would perform better than your existing system that's what i meant because see what error tolerance comes default you don't have to create synonyms you don't have to create synonyms for stemmed words it'll autocorrect right. and the relevancy itself is built so strong that you will automatically start seeing results then as it learns as it as you also understand and become more comfortable with the system then you can start probably making these smaller minuter new two changes where you can probably define a specific set of attributes for a filter facet all that can be done along the way in the next twelve months. you don't have to do it today but just the foundation of the system is so strong that even without doing anything you start seeing increasing conversions.
prospect,is there is there anything in place that makes suggestions as the things that we should do.
rep,so one.
prospect,like we get you know google you know google alert hey here's an idea you know here's a keyword you should add is there anything in place like that.
rep,so that you have to do some reporting but what we can do is especially from a recommendation widget standpoint like the day you start implementing we actually enable a tracker on your system. which will start learning the data by itself so by the time you finish implementation in about say two weeks or three weeks once you've done testing the system would have learned quite some behavior on the site already and it will start bringing in the recommendations and the relevancy by default. and then obviously we can we do monthly reviews with our customers every month and in those monthly reviews we can identify look at the reports and analytics and say okay these are five five different things that we can try this month which will probably increase the conversion from say 10% to 15% and we can together start working on this.
prospect,okay so quick question does do you drive besides driving the the search do you drive the category page as well.
rep,yes we do that.
prospect,okay and we don't only because you're already you're on here with variants we don't use variations on our on our products so if a chair comes in five different colors we don't list those variations on the product page sadly we list them as you know a link to showing all of the different products in our search result but we don't we don't show all the variations on on a page.
rep,okay if there is a way for you to include that in the catalog you send us we can show those variations yeah otherwise unfortunately we can't show it by default if it stuck there we will not be the show.
rep,but yeah if it's there we actually have this color synonym corpus that we've actually built at the back end where we understand which are the primary colors which are the secondary colors and we can start resolving them automatically on the system. and again michale you don't have to do everything on day one we can take a phase wise approach will first make the relevancy better and then we'll start adding a lot of these final elements these ui elements these design elements which will only start making your entire conversions and user experience look better as months go by.
rep,okay and i'll and what i and what we do as i told you about the roi effect in that first three months we will come in and we show you that uptick in conversions only when you see it for yourself is when you can decide okay this makes sense let me start putting in more of my resources onto this and make it better so that is something that will prove on our own.
rep,okay and these are simple things like take zero results today also you might have options where you end up being on a zero results page instead of showing a blank page what we do is just put in these two recommendation widgets right and again there's nothing that you will have to configure the system automatically pulls up the data and starts displaying results. what it does in recently view is while i come onto your site and spend five minutes you pick ten products is there are five products or four products where i have spent more time on i've have done some action i've either looked at product detail page i have to either add them added them on my wish list it basically understands the implicit actions that i've done on my on your site in my current session and just shows those products in recently viewed so that i have already shown an intent i'm probably more likely to re look at those products again. and then these top rated products we look at your last 30 days of machine learning and we understand that which are the most popular brands in products on your site and we display them. so that the we have seen that okay a user coming in from say from la is most likely you to buy such products and this is what my data has told me we're start showing in the same product widget so and again these are very small simple levers that we start pulling out and we've seen that when you mix all of them together add them together it will start making a much of different.
rep,again this is another ui element right if there is a similar product widget that you have on your site so if you click on this instead of taking you to a new browser which kind of inhibits my experience what we do is we basically open this in a modal window right. i'll show it to you on even this us patriots have this to be more like this option i click on this it does not take me to a new browser or new window what you see is it opens up in a modal window shows me all the options i can choose if i want if i like something so i don't like something i just closed and move on with with my current search experience again a very subtle ui variation. and by default everything that works on a laptop works on a mobile device as well this is how it will work on a mobile responsive site or an app and you.
prospect,do you have an example do you have an example of the faceted search on mobile if you have just show me.
rep,yeah this is the one.
rep,this was built for an app the faceted navigation leaf this is what exactly works similarly for a mobile site as well.
prospect,is that a flyout type of.
rep,i didn't understand that.
prospect,on mobile if somebody's on mobile and they and they're using faceted search so that is it it's a flyout from there from the side of the page or drop-down or.
rep,we can customize it the way you want it that's not a problem when we do the initial implementation if you have a mobile responsive site this will be a mini version of how it works on your site if it's an app we can customize it specifically for for an app as well.
rep,i went ahead a few slides so yeah this was the mobile auto suggest piece that we suggested because in mobile when you are typing in something you're more likely to commit a mistake because of fat stubby fingers and category scoping and auto suggest is configured in a way that it works even more effectively on a mobile device. because the reason we do so well on mobiles michael is having a large number of apac customer where mobile penetration is like 70% of the total traffic on an average of most of our customers. like some of the customers we have some of the largest e-commerce sites in india have 92% on on mobile phone and just 8% on desktops and laptops so that's why the mobile is built really well.
prospect,oh yeah i mean we just about 18 months ago we designed our website with responsive with bootstrap so that we could take advantage of that our old site was was terrible and didn't have any really good mobile capabilities. we had a separate mobile website which was terrible at vast so i and i see a lot of our excuse me a lot of our conversions are from mobile so it's <>.
rep,and what's the split now in mobile versus non-mobile.
prospect,i'm sorry you've got a question for me.
rep,what's the split now that you see on your site mobile now.
prospect,you know i honestly i haven't looked at it you know little while but i would say you know mobile is probably easily 30 40 % of our conversions.
rep,wow and and trust me this our solution works brilliant on mobile devices so nothing to worry and if you ever want to build out an app we can also help you customize the app extremely effective this is like one of the designs we've done where we show some kind of customizations for an app. and this is the filters that we've kind of big for one of our customers right so the few subtle things that we've done from a ui standpoint which we believe helps in increasing conversions so yeah so this is i know it's a high-level overview i don't want to spend too much time. because i don't want you to get overwhelm and as i repeated even if we don't do anything for the first three months just with the basic relevancy and auto correction and having a very customized nice design autosuggest you will start seeing a double-digit uptick in conversion.
rep,so this is a quick snapshot about our search platform also wanted to just quickly take you through recommendations probably spend about five minutes so recommendations we've actually used a budget strategy right we've built algorithms based on four themes this is after reviewing tons of retail sites and look at what works and what does not work. so the first thing that we looked for was popularity so this is where we capture up to six months of user data on your site you look at what generally uses by which kind of product which kind of category and generally where these users come from.
prospect,how do you get that information this starting from fresh.
rep,so if i start your implementation now the first day i started i implement a tracking algorithm and we start collecting data on you user like for somebody like newegg just to give you an example. they have close to 100 million products like truckloads of traffic the amount of data transfer that happens between our devices just as a learning tool is roughly about 20 gigs a day that's the amount of data that gets passed on to our big data system with the learnings you have had in one single day right. and these learnings is helpful for us so that we can show where to show a widget for a top-rated product what to showing that widget and what to show in that widget can also encompass off where the user is actually coming from right the second widget we built as a theme was wisdom of your crowd where we said let's let's use collaborative behavior. because this will help us build out widgets which is like a cross sell widget or an up-sell widget because here we look at the buying pattern of the user on the site okay if a user has bought product x what else he is likely to buy with product x does he buy y does he buy a does he buy e does he buy f right.
rep,you look at these groupings and start showing the right kind of cross-sell and up-sell sections right and we exactly know where do we have to show a cross-sell recommendation widget and where do we have to show an up-sell recommendation widget right the third theme that we built our recommendation widgets on was based on content right. when we talk about content what we did was we look at all the product detailing pages and we see what are the products that can be grouped together right if how can we help a user do alternate product discovery on your site. if for some reason i'm looking at probably buying a specific chandelier right how can i show him similar products and at what journey of the product discovery does showing a similar product widget or an alternate product discovery widget so that i basically capture the users attention in completely right. the fourth theme what we built on was the personalization theme here we basically look at it's a cookie based approach if somebody logs in through an incognito window you won't know much information but if he does not then what we know is basically where the user is coming in from what's the seasonality to that location that the user is coming in from.
rep,what generally people coming in from that location on to your site actually buy right and what's your current trend and analytics on on the site and what does that i have been doing in my current session you look at all this data and start showing the right kind of widgets to a user. so this is like a four theme based approach that we've used and we've seen that our recommendation would just work like a champ so some of the examples i'll just share with you this is an example for a personalization widget where we do real-time personalization this name you can basically pick the way you want. like these guys sell bracelets so they basically said hand picked for you as a user i see this i come on to a site and i see something which is hand picked for me i feel good it catches my attention i probably spend some time looking at these products right the second thing is your top seller widgets. as i told you look at machine learning for the last 30 60 90 days and depending on the trend and depending on where i'm coming in as a user it shows me the right set of products that i might mostly likely to give you this is an important one i have there are multiple reasons why i might like might like this product i'm not fully convinced.
rep,i probably want to look at options instead of spending more time to look at options those of widget can show me all the options in a single view right in a single fold right and it helps you make a decision faster cross-sell we understand from your site that five people who bought a humidifier five out of 10 people who bought a humidifier also bought filter. so show whenever a user is buying the humidifier show filter as an add-on which you can cross sell and increase the average order value similarly.
prospect,you can also drive the product page we've.
rep,yes we can.
rep,we can also help you create custom landing pages also you can run specific campaigns you can push in specific banners use that link to the banner on your campaign pdp pages on your facebook page and i'll show you on the dashboard how you can create those as well.
rep,and if it's it's too much overwhelming michael we can take a break and connect tomorrow also it's not problem.
prospect,no no no it's fine.
rep,i'm not <>.
prospect,it's a little it's a little overwhelming.
rep,my intent is definitely not to scare you.
prospect,hey guys i just wanted to jump in here just kind of reiterate michael that the other benefit from our point of views from viking coders point of views so you'll have unbxd and they'll help on that end but we will also always be here so you'll always have a second point of contact and you know we've been doing integrations with them for a while now so we're well versed in it so for an example something goes on saturday you need help you want to figure something out you know viking coders will always be a second point of contact that will always be accessible as well so. i'm just you know i i appreciate that man you know the things that are i mean there's there's there's so much here i would love absolutely love to be able to drive my search results faster than search suggestions product page category page and put everything together so that it is a seamless experience with you know up-selling and cross-selling and suggestions. but i i just don't i mean i don't know i don't know anything about this stuff you know on the other than what i've been doing with search spring for the past four or five years and i on the flip side of that unless i you know unless the results were i don't want to say overwhelming.
prospect,but unless the results were you know really dramatic which they probably would be you know i don't i don't necessarily have a huge outlay of you know funds to take advantage of all of these different things and i i like the idea of being able to build them in slowly but on the flip side of that there's so much great stuff here i don't want to i wouldn't want to build out slowly. i'd want to be able to take advantage of it as quickly as possible especially you know with having multiple having that our product page also have suggestions that was one of the things that i'd wanted to do a search point that search spring doesn't have the capability to drive the product page at least not at a reasonable price point.
prospect,and you know there's so much here i don't even know and i know that you're helpful in the integration and that's great but i don't even know what i don't know like you know i'm a business owner i know my business i know what i sell but you know being a very limited size i don't have anybody other than you know me my wife and a couple of employees. there's not really someone here that other than me that that has the knowledge to you know sit down and put into something like this and my time is already so thin as it is so you know i'm just i'm just concerned that i won't be able to take advantage of some of these things i mean you've got you're scrolling down right now and you've you know 64 pages of possibilities i mean it's.
rep,no the only reason i just moved down a second not to scare with the content.
prospect,no scroll back to top you are killing me.
rep,i just wanted to show you this michael so we understand this see we work with a lot of customers of your size right a lot of them have moved in from sli from search string from extopia with that specific hope that they like actually be able to take advantage of the product we've built. and that's why we understand so then we start supporting customers it's not about calling different support packages and charging money for it we definitely don't charge a single dollar for support for us every customer is a premium customer and you actually get access to a dedicated technical account manager. he or she will be that person whom you can call every single day and he or she is will be the person which can help you start driving all these decisions while you start integrating with us we will not we will not let you let you hanging after we have sold the product to you because then it it just does not serve our purpose right. because we have a non binding contract you can walk in walk out of unbxd at any point in time the only way <>.
prospect,so let me let me read from those technical support back there just designed from there because i mean i know that i support wise i feel confident with you guys design wise you know the implementing i don't know what my question. it's like i guess maybe i'm getting a little bit ahead of myself with with with product page you know worrying about the product page <> more people come in more people come into the product page on my website than through the front page or a category page product pages are are my number one traffic source no matter what the product is. because the way that we've set up our our search engine optimization over the past 15 years has really concentrated on on the product page placement of tags of tags of urls of metadata you know microdata whatever the data is it's all driven by the by the product page.
prospect,i get very very very little traffic from category pages and even less traffic through our front page so i'm just i'm i would love to be able to drive more traffic through category pages and i think you probably do that is by having you know if i have built out a little bit better than the than than the way miva set up over the past couple of years. but product page you know i'd love to grow our product page you know in this state we're not talking about search but just you know our current you know traffic you know i love to be able to build on on those as well at the same time with with highlighting you know the page design.
rep,yeah see there are two things we can do one so especially in driving traffic and conversions on product pages one our navigate our recommendation product i just showed you this does not require any input from your side. here the system will intelligently understand it will once it spends like 30 days on your site it will start showing these recognitions by itself right the second thing is basically how well you can merchandise right i will take you through the dashboard and once we go online i can either send somebody to spend a day with you so that you understand how easy is it for you to start doing merchandising on the site. and trust me it's extremely simple and i'll show you a quick demo of that as well you can then start using the merchandising capability and since you know the source of how this how this traffic is coming in from you can basically start configuring your product pages in a way that people coming in from this specific source exactly sees these products you can start defining the kind of products you want your users to see.
prospect,okay so that's appraised into my next question can you are you able to garner any information from you know from our current google analytics that would help build out our starting point there's any data there that that is you know is recoverable that can be used you know <>.
rep,absolutely <> won't lose out the data so one of the first things we do when we start implementation is get access to your google analytics so that we can start feeding that information into our system because that will give the system a jump start because you don't have to start from zero.
prospect,so you so you'd want access to my google analytics and probably my search spring as well to see you know to see the reporting and see what what they've already <> over the past five years.
prospect,i just wanted to jump in here real quick and let you know one other thing i think one of the best parts of unbxd is their analytics and i'll give you a specific example when compared to search spring. you go and ask search spring how they count like traffic that they bring right to you so for example they will say that this particular purchase was converted because of search spring even though that's not necessarily true because you say hey you know this person came through a product page through search.
prospect,i know i've an idea i've already kind of figured that they you know leaned the tower in their direction a little bit now i take that into account i figure you know when they're telling me that you know a eighty five orders were you know were because the search spring i figure i'll take out you know twenty five percent of that maybe even thirty percent of that you know in this will give them some props but maybe not as much as they like.
prospect,right so here on this end you'll see a lot more accurate data and i mean i know sharath can speak to that as well.
rep,yeah amir you're breaking in and out.
prospect,i apologize gentlemen i'd i was kicked out of my office because they're doing construction in our building and i didn't know that we would relocate.
rep,well that's okay amir so i think we can continue with what we're discussing with michael so michael so i can also take you through the dashboard and spend some time with you you can either do it today if you're feeling overwhelmed we can do it later in the day or tomorrow. but the only thing i wanted to assure you is we'll make sure that we work with you even viking coders is there we and they're a completely trained we can make sure that we spend sufficient time with you to make sure that you start taking the best use of the platform that we've built.
rep,and if you have ten more minutes i want to just quickly take you through how the dashboard looks like so that you're at least understand how seamless it is to start merchandising on the dashboard as well.
prospect,oh i've got time absolutely i made i made i made an hour of time for us today.
rep,awesome awesome so this is the sample demo site that we've built just so that we can show you how the dashboard works right this is a high-level overview of a dashboard that will basically show you the number of products your feed size indexed or not indexed and you can send us your feed through a json and xml or csv or put it up on a very ftp server and we will the data ourselves.
prospect,okay let me let me can i ask you so this is this is one one of my big questions that i that i have for you the our product feed i do work you work off of a product feed that we create or do you work off of spidering indexing our site you know in using meta tags like one of your competitors.
rep,no we basically work on the product feed directly from miva so we have we have built a connector for miva we can directly pull out the product feeds from miva.
prospect,okay so you you have a module you have an unbxd module for miva.
prospect,okay because we have we have a feed that we use template data feed for you know for google for bing we used to use for amazon but it doesn't run automatically it has to be done manually unless we set it up to run manually automatically which we never did through i don't know i don't even understand what i would need to do but i guess it's there but we never go never done that we have we have the search spring module which you know runs automatically at you know 1:00 am. <> every day every morning.
rep,yeah so we do directly pull content from miva and we can configure it to pull content like three four times a day also if it's required so that's not a problem and once we put all the data we put all of them into a field you basically enable/disable fields or make changes again from your catalog we also list all the filters. if at all you need to edit any filters you can edit it here or if you want to add a new filter it's very simple to add a filter and associate to an attribute and for now you don't have to do anything right. and then synonyms as i repeated myself there's no reason for you to build a synonym for error mistakes or stemmed words we will do it all on the fly if there is some jargon that you want to put it up here you can basically add a synonym create unidirectional bi-directional or a replacement recover into it. just a quick high-level overview right and in the same you can manage your test environment development environment if you have a subdomain you can manage that as well this is just a quick overview of the dashboard on merchandising as we discussed you can merchandise your search you can also merchandise your product pages.
rep,we call them browse <> this is basically your category pages right it's fairly seamless to do search i say go back to the demo site and say look for dress right so these products here so if i have to merchandiser this query all i have to do is go to search let me build it from scratch so that you get a quick view of this. so all i have to do is you can go here hit dress create a rule click on merchandise and say click on merchandise is the same result says here the same results will actually appear <> i can do filters i can do promotion and if you want to run a banner we can basically merchandise this take this banner and put this <on the> a pdp page or a facebook page. so it's very easy to do promotions i just showed how so if you want to boost something all you have to do is boost definer civic cleaver of boost and say you want to boost title all you have to do is title contains say eliza what will happen is all the eliza products will get on top and now if you will say drag drop in products you can basically do that. you can pin the products you want right then if you want a specifically say this particular folder i want the high margin product to show to all my user so you want to slot a specific product say position 3 then you can basically brand and so on show ralph lauren product you can say brand contains ralph and what you would notice is the ralph lauren product right here right and.
prospect,this is the search results.
rep,yes this is the search result <> right now go back and click on the same result again the way i've merchandise i had pinned this product plotted this ralph lauren product it will exactly appear like this so this for search right now if you want to go and do the same for your category pages you can set up category rules. you can say okay i want to merchandise run a banner and run specific facet so for me if prices is the most important factor very sensitive the price probably sizes is the second important facet probably color is the third important facet and category is not important. i just define <> right now if i want to run the same <> for these all i have to do is configure rules for my category if if i say want to merchandise my dress the same options for promotions up i can basically drag products pin them they want if i want to sort a specific filter i can use them to sorted by a quick filter is one of the run promotions i can actually run. so exactly how you would do it for search can good for all your category pages as well.
prospect,do you have an unbxd you have a demo dashboard and access to look peak around.
rep,yeah yeah the same dashboard i am showing you and i'll send you this.
rep,so you can do search you can do navigation and reporting right so this will give you like more like a high-level overview for reporting and then here you get search traffic your browse traffic your product use you click through your add to cart your everything will come up right here you can see all your top searches top queries added to cart your zero results and click products. so this way you can know okay these are five queries up to five percent ctr these are ten queries which are performing a say point 2 percent ctr so what is that i can do as the owner to start improving these results on these queries so you can see and set a query level product level. and you can actually drill down by a query michael so if you say dress is my top query you can drill down to dresses basically say how this query is performing in terms of conversions what is the conversion funnel and what are all the products associated with a specific query. like you do it for query you can also do it for every single product as well i don't want to spend much time and get you overwhelmed but i'll send you this and i'm happy to come all again and take you through every single element.
rep,and michael in a nutshell this is a great product you know you can make use of it give us that three-month opportunity we'll show you how great it will work.
rep,so let's talk about the nitty-gritty for a minute sure i know so if you can give me some perspective what's the catalogues and how many sessions you get a month because if we are powering the entire site search to navigation to recommendation <> just to do a sizing right just and how much is the catalogue size and how many sessions you get every month.
prospect,well we have about of 40s about 40 five thousand products and that's all <> that's how it's growing what's the next question i'm sorry.
rep,and how many sessions to get a month.
prospect,i mean search sessions.
rep,overall sessions since for the entire site.
prospect,probably 20000 25000 not enough.
rep,25000 i know and most of it is b2c or a good amount of b2b as well.
prospect,you know it's probably more i don't know let me login to so twenty six thousand two hundred ninety five sessions seventy thousand page views twenty one twenty two thousand users 73 percent new sessions.
rep,and do you have like a four percent conversion at this point in time or is it lower.
prospect,my conversion overview 171 transaction average order value 975 dollars and i'm at under 1%.
prospect,i'd like to i'd like to be a 1 point 5%. <>.
rep,we will work towards it.
prospect,i would like i mean i would like to be at 2% you know at yes here's where i benefit we saw most of our average order is nine hundred and seventy-five dollars which is dollar for dollar they only have one hundred and seventy one of them in the past 30 days but i don't know how many online vendors that are in my category an average order value of nine hundred and seventy-five dollars.
prospect,right so if we're doing if i could if i could do 171 plus you know five percent you know 171 plus five percent to i mean that's you know you know if we if we bumped up you know to one point you know 1 point 2% i would be you know 166 and revenue would be 220 so and if we were at 2% you know we would be at 6 times 3 i'd be it i have you know five hundred thousand a month and you know in revenue. so you know i don't i'm looking for ways to grow that you know and once again search spring has been great but obviously i'm missing out on a lot of revenue so you know and just from the people who are already on our site now not even getting new traffic just getting more sales out of the traffic that we that we have these are people that are buying something. they're either buying it from me buying it from a competitor they're definitely buying it because of all of those people i mean there's a lot of repeat people coming back looking at the same product over and over and over again so yeah we want to capture those as well.
rep,yeah and in this pace you should at least have a conversion of one percent i think below one percent is low and.
prospect,yeah i agree i don't know what you know we've been working the past six months and finding you know other other ways or we we have for the past year. we've been running email re-marketing emails which are you know which are successful maybe not as much as we'd like but nothing never as much as you like you know there's definitely there's definitely someone for improvement you know i think you know you guys could definitely you know be one of the keys to that. there's the thing you know three years ago i spent 250 thousand dollars on cost per click advertising and our number were over one percent in conversions but i didn't make any more money so we thought you know we stopped spending we stopped spending all that on advertising on clicks. because while the sales were there and the traffic was there that we were doing three times as much but we weren't making any more profits so the only people that were winning was google and amazon you know and i was up at night you know working hard and i didn't get to take a rest.
prospect,so we stopped and our traffic has definitely been cut down definitely but on the flip side of that where you run significantly more probable and we have a higher conversion value not a higher conversion rate so.
rep,the value is awesome i think close to a thousand others even drops to 800 what if your conversion goes up to say one point two percent you make hake load of money then.
prospect,i would be very happy to sell look my i was brought up my father always told me to work smarter not harder so you know working smarter to me is being you know a fair a fair value i would be very happy even i would still be very you know $800 what's the average two you know most people are buying you know you know lots of $30 item. <> you know we we the product lines that we sell are higher priced product so a lot of inexpensive price furniture we got we got away from that many many years and we only and we only want to sell priced you know products with with higher margin my average margin you know twenty two percent you know and that's that's what i generally don't like to sell anything that's less than 20 unless unless it's you know really something that thing or fun or easy to sell so. hey michael so what's amir is it's me just want to jump in here what's really interesting about what you're saying is that that pay-per-click that you were spending so that the whole idea there to drive new traffic right which then can drive conversion.
prospect,what's interesting about unbxd even from a you know like for example i don't know if you know fashionable pains they're on miva merchants yeah and but they were they were using search spring right within a month of them switching to to unbxd their conversion rate i don't remember what the exact number was sharath might have that but you can always ask yeah but their conversion rates i mean i think it almost doubled. and and the the point here is this the people that are on your site that are interested in buying the products you know so because you're not selling those $30 one-off products the the barrier to entry into your marketplace is higher but what's interesting is users that are already spending time on your site those are the ones that are most likely to convert and unbxd their entire product is based around those customers. customers up there already interested willing to spend that kind of money and now the question is can you find the product that they need and service them in the most quick manner as possible and that's really what it comes down to that's why this product's so interesting. i agree i agree a hundred percent i agree a hundred percent and that's that's definitely what we're trying to do is the people who are already on the site new traffic is awesome obviously we have to have new traffic because i can't sell the same person ten tv stands we're not selling diapers you know but so we definitely need more traffic in order to to grow.
prospect,and we're doing that through social platforms that are less expensive and actually pinterest is my number one number one traffic conversion rate comes out of pinterest and it cost me z because i don't even spend on the pinterest advertising but yet i'm sure i'll have to facebook is is climbing. and certainly google organic and google paid search are my number one overall. you know the people who are already on the way those are the ones that i want to they're they're here for a reason now i need to get find them what they're looking for and get it in their shopping cart and get their money as quickly as possibly and put it into mine.
rep,and then that's michael becomes extremely critical how how how how do you treat users when come to your site is exactly what we mean by product discovery right and you look at unbxd as a whole right.
rep,from search from an autocomplete experience to going through product category pages to having the right kind of widgets at the right place all through the discovery experience field or a journey or user this is what we specialize it so and let see i can keep talking more unbxd for the next five hours because that's my job right but i can actually business ensure to you what kind of difference we can make.
prospect,alright so back that go to the nitty-gritty format so taking jumping off of the diving board with best practices with your suggested you know taking your suggestions and your knowledge into account and building out our search based on on that starting fresh and you know we're with what you think we should be doing.
prospect,because you're the search expert i'm the furniture expert you know amir and you i mean what am i looking at as costs for building out and what am i looking at for a cost monthly to continue keep in mind i you know i don't you know i get a pretty good deal out of search spring you know i certainly don't i don't want to spend more at least not off the bat unless i see if i see results. then i don't care search cost me a thousand honestly i don't care if it cost me a thousand a month i don't care if it cost me five thousand a month if the if the proof is in the pudding and you're driving you know more sales it doesn't. i'm happy to let other people make money as long as i'm not losing money so i mean if you can if you can put together a proposal for me i'd be happy to give you access to my google analytics and to my search spring you can take a look at what's happening what we need to do and put together a proposal for me i'm i mean i'm certainly excited to read it and you know to move forward if it's if it makes you know.
rep,let's let's do it right now without wasting too much time i know you are a busy man and and i have a lot of customers to take care of so yeah this is what i do i'll make it absolutely comfortable for you you let me know what you're paying to search spring right i'll do a price match for now. because as of today though i've shown you awesome things about a product you don't know you don't know how it actually works out well for you right let that be a starting point and i'm happy to take an roi driver right. if i can come in and say increase your conversions by ten percent in month one pay me a thousand dollars if i don't do anything pay me if i don't do anything significant pay me what do you pay to search spring so that you're not paying anything more to a new provider.
rep,but we're also absolutely sure that you at least get a minimum value of what what we can bring onto the table and i'm ready to take that bet because i'm confident i'll at least do 10% and more for your site in month one.
rep,if i don't do anything significant then it's it's fine we'll put in the effort and after three months you don't see results you don't have to pay as anything.
prospect,i mean what are you what are you charging for to build it all out.
rep,so again that integration fees that can give you an insight so this will be a one-time fee i think i can give you the exact number after we do an implementation scope call i just need to understand the complexity  involved but i'll give you a ballpark number it will vary between fifteen hundred dollars to two and a half thousand dollars that would be a one-time fee.
rep,i don't know the exact number because i'll have to get my engineer he or she will have a discussion with you and once we get the complexity right we will bill it out for you but for the first three months michael this is what you have to do if we say decide two thousand dollars is the implementation fee you pay us 50% of that upfront nothing more. we will implement the product you start using the product use it for the next three months add the price you pay to search spring thing if you pay say four hundred dollars the first thing i don't know the exact number.
prospect,it's $399.
rep,yeah give us the same amount as you pay of search spring for the first three months right but at the end of three months if we can show you that uptick in conversions and if you are a happy customer then you start playing us a thousand dollars a month if you don't see value you don't have to pay anything.
prospect,never.
rep,what you pay is to search spring $400 a month you'll be we'll charge you the same if we don't show value but.
prospect,i understand also i don't have to revert but we can continue to grow until we do see value. it looks like a really fantastic pack so i can't imagine not all right can-can i can i let me digest some of this and then go have a go have a drink.
rep,absolutely please do.
prospect,and if you can alright let me let me give me let me think about this and what i want to do.
rep,amir i can give you my number with you i can give you my personal phone number you can give me a call end of the day today or tomorrow or whenever you have completely digested this.
prospect,alright what's the time difference where you and i are.
rep,i'm in chicago.
prospect,so your you're in chicago two hours behind alright.
rep,so i'll be i live in sf i'll be back in sf on friday but to friday i'm here.
prospect,okay what's your what you want to eat all right what's your what's your phone number.
rep,5 5 1 0 4 5 8 7 8 8 6 or you can just give me your number i'll give you a call or i'll just send.
prospect,yeah yes my office is there area code 71 8 4 3 2 4 4 2 if you could email over to me the support link so i could take a look in there that would be great.
prospect,alright okay.
prospect,alright that would be great and amir if you could touch me ask me a little later on this afternoon that would be great too. yeah michael no problem. alright give me give me a couple hours to get some work done and think about this a little bit and and we'll reconvene shortly. okay.
rep,sure so thank you so much my bluffing your time.
prospect,thank you now i appreciate your time you showed me a lot of a lot of great things and i'm excited but i'm a little overwhelmed so maybe a shot of tequila and then and then i'll be then i'll have a clear head.
rep,i would like some too.
prospect,i'm kidding i'm kidding i don't drink it when i afternoon. but yeah long time ago not anymore not if i want to get anything done.
prospect,yeah thank you.
rep,awesome great good morning and thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk today.
rep,awesome let me just share my screen so while i'm i'm sharing my screen
rep,just just curious ben and nancy what caught your interest in unbxd why site search and if you can give me a little more understanding about filtration group that would really help me show you the right elements of the solution today.
prospect,i'll give you a little overview on filtration group we're a multinational corporation growing through acquisition we've got a very broad base of manufacturing companies and a one pure pure line distributor all kind of in the filtration industry but in a but in in many different pieces of that industry. we we launched a website filtration group dot com in january of this year to sell products online to our existing customers and to go out and find new customers we as i said in my email use solr search on the site i listened to the webinar the other day and during the webinar you guys said you would do a free kind of site evaluation or search evaluation so i was interested in hearing about that.
rep,so sounds good i'll surely do that i've put a quick agenda here for today's discussion then and thank you for giving me that that quick overview about protection group that surely helps me. we want to talk four things a talk a little about us b show you few of the elements on site search are the areas of opportunity that we see from our perspective where you can increase the conversion rate and up to 10 to 20% at least by improving some of the small little search elements right. if you like that then i can walk you through this search solution that unbxd provides and how we solve some of these challenges and lastly i can discuss any other questions you might have like the pricing or any additional questions on roi any of those questions is that okay with you.
prospect,yeah that sounds good.
rep,so to talk a little about us we are six years old company headquartered in sunnyvale with offices in chicago and back in india the core engineering team works out of the sunnyvale office the customer success and sales team works out of chicago we do have still support and tech support available in india as well. we have one of we are one of the largest search providers in apac and then the huge presence in apac too over 120 customers in the us 1200 hundred plus customers globally we serve over 1 point 5 billion interactions a month which is more than the top three e-commerce retailers put together doing each month.
rep,from from an industry perspective an industry agnostic solution can fit into any industry any size of company be it's a fashion we're working with express rue 21 is something that's in implementation going live i'm sure at least you heard harvey from ib supply on the webinar and they are based out of milwaukee. us auto parts something that's an implementation that's a huge implementation because if i'm not wrong there they're good 150 to 200 million product catalogue right that's how huge the catalogue is and that's the scale at which we're solving site search today hh gregg we're done with the poc they're going live in jan that's like they were they had a we hit the code freeze by the time we finished the poc and hence going live in jan. but some of the other customers are all live fresh direct like ashley furniture store the largest online furniture store is using us today right from a platform perspective we are a platform agnostic solution.
rep,you can integrate any e-commerce platform be it one of these out-of-the-box e-commerce platform shopify bigcommerce any of these or an in-house e-commerce platform something that's custom built we could also implement into that right so gives us the ability to work with any company with regards to the e-commerce.
prospect,okay so how let me let me ask you real quick question we're on the inner shop platform and tell me how the i mean you you're agnostic and you have out-of-the-box connections to that grid but how do those connections work or does it require a you know building connectors to the platform or is it outside of the platform.
rep,no it is outside of the platform all we would need is the product catalogue feed so what we do is an in page ajax implementation right so you continue to own the domain you continue to render the header and the footer for every search results page what we do is we we insert an empty div tag or we put an empty div tag and start inserting the search results through html that's one way of implementation. the second way is obviously the api right wherein we build these connectors the back-end implementation right we build these connectors to start regularly pulling up data automatically from your system and that start talking to the e-commerce platform and start rendering results. from a poc perspective what most of our e-commerce customers prefer is an in page ajax if you look at express or if you look at ashley furniture so they're still on an in page ajax implementation. because that gives them a very quick way of implementing the solution and testing it to decide if they would want to go for a longer i would say a longer effort<>.
prospect,we lost you.
rep,<> and our engineering team is already working with them to go and back-end api integration which is a little longer process right but in the meantime they could test us they could decide if if unbxd is the right solution for them or not. does that answer your question ben.
prospect,okay. yeah i think so and we can we can we can come back on that what we need to.
rep,sure here are some stats the most important is like one of the research from jupiter say is that 80% of your visitors will actually leave the site if you have a poor search and the reason is they're so habitual of searching on google and amazon today that that if you're not showing them the right product they believe it <shines like any of the competition site maybe just google it>.
prospect,you know you're cutting in and out over here we're not we're not we're not here in all this but also we were i was hoping to i mean this is what we saw on the webinar basically i was hoping to get to more of a demo of your of your system.
rep,sure i'll get there so here is an example right i'm not sure if you looked at this one but say blue jeans blue jeans right before and after for express this is what they used to show before this right and what the elements that we bring into picture are machine learning personalization contextual search and putting all these three together this is what you see on the site today. this is what has helped them increase their revenue by sixty percent within the first 90 days right and then i'll show you walk you through each of these elements here are some of the numbers in terms of <you or> is it okay if i was to walk you through few of the used cases specific to your site would that be fine.
prospect,yeah that's fine we lost you again for a minute there while we've been on this <give me our networks something just something was just>.
rep,can you guys hear us yes ben i can hear you give me a second i'll dial in from the phone looks like my internet is really slow just saying. hi ben can you hear me now.
prospect,yes that's much better.
rep,okay awesome sorry for that can you see my screen.
prospect,yes i'm on the business impact of unbxd site search on the right thing.
rep,no actually not on the used cases we focus on.
prospect,okay i may be may be that i'm behind maybe i got disconnected or something .
rep,let me know when you see my screen.
prospect,yeah maybe that my connections messed up or something so i'm connected <> yeah they're.
rep,used cases we focus on.
prospect,okay okay. i'm still gonna refresh i'm just refreshing going to meeting <> all right now i see use cases.
rep,okay awesome so here a few use cases i'll walk you through of your site and i will show you few of the examples in terms of how we solve it today how do we do it and then how do we approach it.
rep,so on high-level autosuggest error tolerance on your on your site contextual relevancy most key important things some of the ui elements on the site the merchandising dashboard the back end and then the overall infrastructure of the sites right which could be the search speed uptime and the and the scalability.
rep,so quickly wanted to show you the autosuggest piece right this is what i see on the on the site today i start typing in fil it start showing me some of the suggestions the search terms i start typing in spr gives me some sort of spray food filter spray booth maintenance right makes some suggestions which is good. but the idea is to start exposing the customers with an auto guided suggests which is visual in nature start showing them some of the images on the on the auto suggest and there are few elements which are very specific to each businesses on auto suggest and i'll show you what what elements are these and then how we customize for each of the businesses. to give you one of the or say let me actually show you some of the live sites just give me a second this will give you a better feel of what i want to talk about do you see the parts warehouse screen.
prospect,yeah <>.
rep,parts warehouse they they primarily sell i would say vacuum cleaner and other home appliance parts online okay before we came in they used to have two different search boxes here for two different kind of visitors on their site. one who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the name of the model that they're looking parts for right we came in we said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box. so instead what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in this cell on the left hand side you see all the parts for the cell on the right hand side you see all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for the set rights very specific to parts warehouse let me show you another example say express dot com. for express as a brand for them what was important was the categories now the moment i start typing in jeans you'll see jeans for all the various different categories not just that when i browse through these the products on the left hand side actually start changing in real time right start showing the popular products for each each of these categories. not just that when i was doing this demo yesterday or i would say not yesterday actually last week this red jeans wasn't there it was actually blue jeans that was coming up here but today this is red jeans this shows that in in last i would say 48 to 72 hours red jeans has become more popular on their site and that's what people are more buying or looking at and then that's where this comes in right. so this is highly personalized in in real time based on user behaviour the user intent on the site and on popularity that these results come up here is another example big basket i know this is not from your vertical but wanted to show you the breadth of the customization of the solution specific to your needs right and some of the elements might be important for you here.
rep,so big basket dot com the second largest grocery store with them what was what was the challenge was they had a lot of repeat visitors who used to buy 15 to 20 products in each and every interaction they used to do on the site and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go and search go to the pdp page and add to cart for these products. so instead what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in say let me do chicken you see all the chicken options here shows you the delivery options how fast it can be delivered gives the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from search box on the right hand side start showing some of the commonly searched terms popular brands some of the categories. not just that within within the search terms here but we have done is added personalization to it meaning if i as a buyer if i'm buying masala chicken more often i would see masala chicken on top but if you are buying nuggets chicken more often you would start seeing nuggets chicken on top right add to cart actually helps a lot of b2b customers as well.
rep,especially when they have customers who come for a lot of replenishments right then when customers come in and buy same products month on month it does make sense to add that button onto the autosuggest search bar as well because they exactly know what they are looking for.
rep,so do you have such customers who buy again and again on the site or is it more of one-time visit and say a quarter or a year or in a longer period.
prospect,no its we have a lot of customers who buy very regularly that's that's needs functionality for us yes.
rep,okay awesome great so these are the few like custom elements and this is this happens during the very initial phase of our engagement we understand your business our analyst would understand your business interacting with you and your team what is important on your business why customers buy from you right and try and implement few of these business elements very specific to your needs on to the auto suggest. now this is the first interaction that the customer has made the next that we see is the error tolerance right it's something like say the spellcheck or the the spelling mistakes let me just make sure you're seeing my screen do you see the spellcheck screen.
rep,right so what i try to do is simulate a behaviour wherein say a customer comes and tries to type fast or eventually misspell words on the site right i tried nebulizers with an f instead of z you see gives me a zero results page i i try the looking for filter you have a lot of filters on the site i try to interchange p and l if someone trying to type fast interchange of words p and l you see zero results page. when i do something similar for for say some of the other customers right and i tried this for ib supply them being a b2b customer of ours i tried nebulizer with an f and you see it automatically corrects it and start showing and start showing me with right nebulizer.
rep,same thing i tried for filters right tried fitler interchange the t and l it automatically corrects it and starts showing me the right set of filters right now this is something that we solve out-of-the-box you do not have to do anything we can automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabet for misspelled in each word right that's the strength of the auto correction algorithm. around 85 to 90 percent of your search query would be automatically corrected by the search algorithm without you having to do anything right here is an example black leather jacket all three misspelled right with a with an alphabet missing in all three we automatically corrected and start showing the results without waiting for the customer to click on something any any questions here.
prospect,no that's great.
rep,words could be singular plural words with space without space i hope you can still see my screen the stemming related issues. okay awesome then comes stemmed words right stemming words could be singular plural words with space without space i hope you can still see my screen the stemming related issues.
prospect,yeah we're just seeing spellcheck is still here.
rep,okay just a second.
prospect,can you to refresh again <>.
rep,okay awesome so stemming right i tried a few examples so i know that <> is one of the i think brands or kind of a product that you have right so i tried to type that without the space didn't work gave me a zero result page then i look for another product which was a polyester guzzler bag right i tried that with 60 inch as i n c h and then i tried it again with sixty double quotes alright. and you see the difference because the system is not able to understand that that's the double quotes in on this particular query actually refers to i n c h and that's why i'm seen in one case i see two products in the other case i see ten products right so we again automatically solve all of these stemmed issues. could be singular plural words could be words like say game gaming center central could be some of these symbols or abbreviations or even slang that at times right system is automatically able to understand this without you and your merchants having to do anything at the back end.
prospect,okay so we don't have to set that up it's it's in your kind of in your library of of alternatives and spellings.
rep,yes we do take care of it so for both stemming and spellcheck you do not have to do anything for synonymous words you do not have to do do anything right everything is something that's that's primarily taken care of through our i would say the universal corpus any any other questions ben.
prospect,nope no.
rep,here is an example say for express right t-shirt t space shirts t-shirts tees stemming all being the same the intent of the customer is not changing whether he is looking for thees t-shirts with a space with an s without an s all mean the same and hence it becomes important that we show them the right set of results irrespective of how they are searching right.
rep,and this is only possible through contextual relevance by understanding the intent of the customer that the unbxd system is able to do today then i looked at search speed this was actually worrying for for a few of your queries that i tried your search speed was over 2000 milliseconds which is which is surely a red signal something that you need to look at. it should be less than three milliseconds as as per industry standards 500 milliseconds is something that's okay anything five more than 500 milliseconds is surely something to be worried about and to be looked into but in your case i noticed that being more than 2000 milliseconds. and we provide an sla for your search results page the results would be would be delivered below 300 milliseconds in reality actually 90% and above search results pages are actually rendered within 100 milliseconds here is an example for that this is for express and this is a test that was done on black friday one of the busiest day on on the express site right during the black friday sale and one of our engineer actually they happen to do this test and then pull up this image which we also shared with express and now ashley guys are using it for our references.
prospect,this site actually went down on black friday did it not first white actually went down on black friday did it not.
rep,it did not the express site. no i surely don't think so i'm not sure if that was for a particular region because of any specific server being down at their end but not with regards to us we never heard of a downtime from them okay.
rep,so on top of this what we have built is as a technology the ability to understand any kind of search query that people are doing on your site today right and this is through the technology and this is where the contextual relevance comes into picture so these are the 12 different types of queries that can actually occur on an e-commerce site and there can't be a query that is outside of this. to give you an example an exact search when i know the exact product number i know the exact product name the product id that i'm looking for feature search could be a black dress where black is the feature of the product dress thematic search could be a party dress where party is a theme for the product dress right. and and say slangs or abbreviations in terms of inch being written as double quotes natural language say on an on an on an gifting site or on an apparel site i go and look for christmas gifts for toddlers right it's important that we understand the intent of the customer because if you search this today on google google will start showing you the results and that's exactly what you need to do on an e-commerce site as well. so with us we have built a technology that is able to understand 85 to 90 percent of all these different types of queries i looked at some of these on your site to see how how well this was working to give you an example i was looking for say media filter. now when i look for media filter and on the left hand side when i look at the filters that you've got within filtran as a brand i could see only three products right so this this my assumption was that you carry three products which are by filtran and which are media filters. the moment i start searching for a filteran media filter i actually got over twelve hundred and eighty products for me as a customer confusing me in terms of what exactly i should be looking at out of these twelve hundred and eighty products then i look for a product type right i look for say an aluminium frame air filter and i'm not sure if this is how people search on your site this is purely my assumption.
rep,i'm not very sure about how how people search in your industry when i looked at few product descriptions and tried to you know tried to search products in various different ways right so i know that you you have some sort of air filter and this comes with an aluminium frame i could see that in the description here when i actually look for aluminium frame air filters these start showing me filters which have an aluminium mesh and not primarily the aluminium frame right. and this is all happening because of a text pattern match right what is this what what the system is trying to do is when search for aluminium frame air and filter all these words one by one right so for say it will first look for all four words then may be the three then two and then one and start showing all the products that have these words in particular. that's one way or sometimes systems also do a minimal match but they do not understand the intent that it's that the customer is actually looking for a product which is air filter and frame is an attribute and aluminium is a material attribute of for that frame right and that is what is important to understand. i look for say black logitech wireless keyboard on on ib supply right it shows me immediately shows me the right set of results or i look for a bright air sixteen point nine ounce spray bottle right very specific product that i am looking for and it start showing me the right set of results. then i look for some of the features on the site right so i look for a suction catheter with a bulb tip right that's again something that i look at your description and try to find that as as a search but then got zero results same thing on express say someone looking for a full sleeve wear for women or black v-neck for women right more specific i would say product that is being mentioned here. but again it's it's able to the system is able to split this break this query into various different words and understanding that black is actually the color v-neck is the style women is the gender right and that's what someone is looking for and then start showing the right set of results and not showing black shoes for women or black bags for women in that case.
rep,something like non product search say <> go ahead.
prospect,no i was just agreeing.
rep,okay cool again non products are something again that's that's very important to understand i look for this shipping policy on your site i look for returns on the site understanding what what those those would be for your site it gives me zero results page. there are various different ways you can handle non product queries you can create various different links but the idea is that unbox has the ability to even i would say make the non product query searchable at times we also make content searchable if you have any articles you have any any blogs or any other content materials that's available on the site we can also make that piece searchable.
rep,do you have any training materials or any content <>.
prospect,yeah we have a lot of content and that is something that we need to make searchable but how do you like on the on the other site you had all that this pop-up and the products all showing up and add to cart all of that how do you determine that they're interested in content and not throw all of the products up in their face.
rep,determining would be would be you know when when someone starts looking for something it's not i would say it's not possible for us to say determine but there are various different ways that we can start showing content and and once the customer clicks on it then we understand the intent of the customer and start i would say bringing that into the popularity of the user behaviour basically and start showing them more content if they're interested in more content versus product.
rep,so here is an example of say crystal vaults site with them and they came came to us for them the most important thing was to make their content searchable if i'm not wrong they have over 50000 articles and that's the main source of traffic on their site where people come to read a lot about various different crystals right. and they always wanted the content to be searchable but then the business still runs on on selling products right and hence they would still want to push products first still giving customer the ability to read content. so here if i say type amethyst right on the left hand side you see all the products here these are all the products right but here you see there are some content pages right amethyst meaning and uses if i click on this this actually takes me to a page that shows me content right these other guided the resources these are not products these are all content pages for amethyst and then again we start showing products right.
rep,so there are various different ways that we can start showing it the idea is the ability to read and the relevance and show the relevant products how to show the relevant products in terms of the ui element then understand your business what kind of customers look at your content and and when is it that you want to make it searchable non searchable and we can do that for you. does that answer your question ben.
prospect,yeah thank you so on express for instance how did you get to that page on express i mean if you go to the express site and typed in returns does it what it say.
rep,so this this gives them the returns policy right the ability to look at any of the returns policy so when someone looks at returns it shows you the us returns the canada returns right so the the system is able to understand that someone looking typing in returns is primarily looking for return policies and not a product which might have returns somewhere in there and this is something that we are able to understand from the from the machine learning algorithm and people are typing few terms what is it that they are clicking on so over a period of time the system is able to understand that.
rep,even within these say four pages here you see us on top but say the next ten visitors on the site actually clicked on can say the canada return policy more often then obviously the canada policy would go on top and us would come on come down the row. so the next is i looked at some sort of compatibility search right again and i'm very very i would say new to your industry so was not even sure if this is something that that that would be considered as a compatible search but i try to make an assumption and look at this when i look for powder booth filters on google you come up on the first or the second page of the google search results page that's that's the first thing. when i click on that link takes me to this particular page and this is what it shows me as powder booth filters but when i actually search for powder booth filters it gives me these set of results i was not sure how relevant these results were but just wanted to show something that you are spending for on google you are showing on top on google but within the site when i try and type that as or search for that the result sets are surely not relevant. does that make sense.
rep,so here is is an example for i would say express if i was to look for tops for jeans it shows me the tops and not jeans right it's able to understand that that someone is looking for tops and not jeans as a product same thing for say theme based queries like someone looking for a winter jacket right someone coming and looking  for expensive suits for men alright. now the system is able to understand expensive means higher in price more luxury element comes into picture so that's the kind of training that we give to the algorithms for all our customer sites to be able to understand search terms understand natural language queries and then show the right set of results.
rep,here is another example i tried on the site look for purabead and i tried this in various different ways as a natural language query this is the product this comes in a dimension of 24 by 12 inches if i'm not wrong that that's what the product description here says now i look for 24 by 12 purabead <at level 10> here could not get anything i look for 24 star 12 again the results page then i look for 24 inch purabead a zero results page right. so it is again important to understand any such you know natural language variations in your search queries that the customers that the customers are doing and show them the right set of results. here it is an example right blue dress on sale again natural language query products on sale i would say are are something like best dress available right something of those lines on those lines and the system is able to understand and then show the right set of results head query search right when the intent of the customer is not clear for your site.
rep,if i was to take an example i'm the closest that i could i could think of was filters and you have so many various different filters now if someone comes on your site and looks for filters you show seven thousand seven hundred and forty nine products right and the only way for them to filter rate is through the facets on the left hand side choose the right facet and start seeing seeing the products that they might be more interested in which is which is a very traditional way of navigating the customers through a larger set of search results page right. but with us what we do is we put in various different elements to it right we have the technology to identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity so here say for mobile we are yet not clear about the intent of the customer so we start showing various different categories crossing mobile right so it could be mobile mobile headphones cases and covers mobile headset. and at the same time we start showing results for the most popular category that is mobiles here right so we have started showing mobile's over a period of times customers customers were clicking on mobile cases and covers more often then mobile cases and covers would come on position two and the mobile headphones would go on position three right. so that's where the popularity comes into picture and the relevance also improves and that covers and cases is the more profit preferred sorry category than headphones and that that's more important so should be on on on the top order and not at the lower fold.
rep,here is another example a demo that we built for out net if i was to look for alexander wang who builds a lot of various different products like shoes shoulder bag totes dresses you see all of these products neatly bucketed into each category giving you the ability to browse through these products horizontally or vertically on a single page.
rep,and not necessarily that that all of these ui elements might fit into your business but again to show you how few of these elements can be customized right facets and filters it was good to see that you do have facets and filters but these are very static right static in two ways one is filter by category filter by brand there are these two or three elements that's show up for each of your products i'm sure there are various different elements and that could also be searchable or non searchable. and number two was the order or the or the filters that are available they're usually in the alphabetic order right especially on the on the category side and the on the brand side i know they were they were more from the count of the products that you have today right the higher the count of the brand comes on top. with us what we do differently is make these filters dynamic in nature in two ways so to give you an example say for jeans as a category you might want to come and set the right set of filters right it could be gender size type fit availability price right now irrespective of how someone searches for jeans right so it could be blue jeans black jeans red jeans skinny jeans. sometimes they might not even use the word jeans and they might come in and say levi's right as far as 75% or more products in that on that search results page are from jeans as a category the jeans filters would automatically kick in right that's one level of dynamicness. now two the second way that that these filters could be made dynamic is once you set these orders say gender size type fit if over a period of time people were clicking on fit more often then fit would come on top gender would go down the row right so that's the second level of of dynamicness into the filters. then the third level of dynamicness obviously is say in your case could be brand right say brand right for for this particular filter there's a category if purafill as a brand was more popular then purafill would come on top and filtration group would go down.
rep,so that's how these filters are dynamic in nature and sets us apart zero results page today your zero results page are pretty static do not show anything when when we end up hitting as zero result page right we believe that the onus is on customer to ohh sorry the onus is on us to start directing the customer in the right direction once they hit a zero results page. and there could be various reasons why they why they see a zero results page could be because you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or say you you know the search queries so butcher that it's really difficult for us to understand the intent of the customer in that case we do this in real time highly personalized for each user. we place two different widgets recently viewed and say recommendations recently viewed are the products that they have been looking at on your site during time spent now based on their affinity towards a brand was a colour towards a price point we start recommending few products in real time which they would be more likable to buy right. and this gives them the ability to either go back or go forward in their overall product discovery journey on the site any any questions on these search elements that i walked you through.
prospect,no no it's great.
rep,okay awesome do you have merchandisers who kind of merchandise the site today do you have a merchandising team.
prospect,we don't have a designated merchandising team at this point we're small team <> team right now.
rep,got it so in that case let me yeah go ahead.
prospect,we are young.
rep,completely understand and and i'm we are here at unbxd to to make your life much more simpler and let me take five minutes to walk you through our merchandising dashboard right the backend dashboard to show you how easy or simple it is for you to make few changes add some rules which are very specific to your business specific to your need and then and some of the reports which you can look at on a weekly monthly quarterly basis to understand what's working or not working. but on a high-level what this merchandising dashboard allows you to do is to run say promotions which could be a brand promotions could be our seasonal promotions any new arrivals take care of your inventory it could be do not show products or show products which are high inventory push products which are higher higher margin products right. and and we do this through various different rules that can be set at the backend could be through boosting plotting filters banners and i'll show you how to do this right let me actually rather than walking you through these slides quickly show you a demo of the dashboard so this is the demo the more dashboard that you will have access to once the implementation is being done. you'll have you can you can manage multiple domains multiple sites through single dashboard login do you see my screen the unbxd overview quick info.
prospect,yes yeah.
rep,yeah so this is the dashboard login you'll have complete information on how many products you have what's the feed size like these are your product catalogue feeds we make them searchable non searchable for your search results page but you will have complete access or visibility into it. these are your filters your global filters right across the site and it's very simple to add filters say price say like the product catalogue attribute create facet and you are done synonyms rights and to reiterate you can be given the ability to create synonyms for i would say industry jargons something very specific to your industry. this is not for anonymous words this is not for stemmed or misspelled words right this is only for industry jargon to give you an example in the weightlifting world shoes are called lifters now we would not know that shoes are called lifters in a particular industry also it wouldn't make sense for us to add this into our universal corpus because lifters might mean something else in a different industry altogether. so in in those corners cases we'll give you the ability to create these synonyms which could be unidirectional or bi-directional create synonyms and you're done right that's how simple it is to do this if you already have a list of industry identified synonyms you can share that with our team and our team can also upload this during the implementation or post implementation. then let me show you merchandising how you can merchandise your search results page this is where you can set global rules right so global rules could be always promote<> any questions nancy.
rep,i thought i heard something okay so global rules you can you can set any any any rules applicable to all your search queries could be say always i would say always promote home brand do not show out of inventory products any such rules and let me show you how you can create these rules by taking an example of a query dress and this is the live site if i was to do dress here on the live site you will see two blue dresses one stripe dress one brown dress right this is what you see on the live site today. and this is the 90% experience that we are talking about these are all dresses based on popularity based on geo-location based on the rules that are being set right and then we give you give you the ability to take this experience to 100% by creating rules which are very specific to your business and your need. and let me show you this example so for dress now you will see replica off your site right here right the first to blue dress and striped and then brown this is same as what we are seeing on the live dress your merchants can come in or you can come in here and create rules or they create filters you can filter this based on on a particular brand category any other product catalog attributes or run promotions by doing sorting boosting. so let me boost a particular brand brand you could also boost a category any attribute right then contains eliza you see all of your eliza products on top now even within this say this particular product is is going out of inventory or out of fashion i want on top i can drag and drop and pin products this particular dress also i want in position two i can drag and drop pin products this is a product level placement that you can do. now let me show you how you could do a a product catalogue attribute level placement through slotting you could come at position 5 to 7 i want products from a particular category or particular brands say ok you can i could also say category contains bridal brand contains ralph and you will see the five six seven these are all ralph lauren products.
rep,do you see a use case for this.
prospect,possibly oh no no possibly clear but it's interesting.
rep,okay awesome you can also add banners to these search results page right so every time someone is looking for dress these results would come up and a particular banner that you can insert through image url or through a landing page url or through an html would also show up and all of these changes actually occur on the site in real time if i hit dress now you'll see the results have changed these are the first two dresses that we pin and these are the ralph lauren dresses that we had slotted and now let me show you one more use case which is creating landing pages.
rep,do you do you create landing pages quite often.
prospect,we do it yes.
rep,yes okay awesome so say clearance 2016 if i was to do that on this live site today i don't see anything i only see some products being recommended i come back onto the the dashboard clearance 2016 creates rule merchandise obviously it wouldn't show me anything because there is nothing in the catalogue today under clearance 2016 so i can click on convert to landing page click okay now the complete catalogue is available for us to curate for this particular landing page or for this particular query too. so you can now come and and run various different i would say filter sorting slotting say brand contains eliza same rules like we did first for dress as a query right eliza you can again run promotions through sorting boosting slotting pin products drag and drop and add banners also to this particular page drag and drop the red dress the blue dress two blue and then the first and the last being red dresses. so i go back onto the site now hit clearance 2016 shows me the same results sets the red dress the two blue and then the red dress and the others you can now take this particular url and start using this for any of your marketing campaigns could be our email marketing campaigns seo campaigns sem campaign any any campaign that you want to use this for right so very simple to use or or to create landing pages before i go to reporting i want to quickly show you filters how you can create filters for a particular category. so say for categories sneakers right you want to set a particular set of filters and banner so you you can set up particular banner insert the banners here come here look at the facets now you can choose which facets you want to show which you want to hide. so i want to hide say category as a filters i want to hide price as a filter i want size filter on top so i can drag and drop and then i want the colour filter on position two i can drag and drop now irrespective of how someone searches for sneakers could be sneakers casual sneakers men sneakers women sneakers as far as 75% or more results are from sneakers as a category these filters would automatically kick in in this particular order.
prospect,oh  that's great.
rep,any any questions on merchandising and i i before i walk you through the reports.
prospect,no it's good.
rep,okay awesome so what do you used for reporting today the site reporting do you use google analytics or any other solution.
prospect,we use google analytics  with tag manager we don't have a ton of metrics beyond that at this point.
rep,okay so with regards to search reporting right one of the challenge that google analytics and all these traditional tools have is that once say i come onto your search and i come to your site right and i start my search session with search i searched for something i don't find it i do navigation and i end up buying a product. just because my session on your site started with search google will still tell you that it was a search conversion and not a navigation conversion right it's a very traditional problem with search reporting through some of these solutions that we come in and then solve from a technology perspective we can clearly define what what's what what a browse traffic is versus what your search traffic is we give you three levels of reporting.
rep,one is the high level executive reporting or top search queries top products added to cart top zero results queries on top clicked products right these are some of the high level executive reporting and this is this is not say top 200 queries or two to top 200 products but you can see all the data available based on particular time frame right then you can define the time could be one month one week one quarter one year and that you want to look the data for. then the next is a detailed query level reporting right each and every query on your site with the metrics with regards to what their hits are cdrs conversions add to cart and orders now if i look at this particular query gives me a trendline a sales trendline how this query has been performing and what are the products associated with this query which are converting or not converting. on the flip side we give you each and every product level reporting right every product listed on the site gives your product views added to add to carts if i click on this particular product it now shows me a sales trend line for this particular product and what are the queries that this product is associated. any any questions on reporting.
prospect,no it's not me.
rep,awesome i think that's the solution any question calls like it not like it.
prospect,no i like it you know in the in the webinar you guys talked a little bit briefly about how you how you charge for this give me an overview of kind of how you charge for this some idea of what it cost and what's involved if you will.
rep,it typically goes by the search sessions right so i'm i was i just wanted to double confirm this you told me that you have your total session that's 2000 oh sorry 20000 as your total sessions but how about your search session how do they look like today.
prospect,do you remember that from last month yeah we're we're just getting our we're just getting starting to get data on our search so i think last last month we started tracking and getting that data so i'm not certain but i'm guessing that it's not in the it's not in the multiple thousands yet at this point.
rep,okay okay so for a b2b business like you right our starting point around $2000 a month that includes anywhere between 4 or 5000 search sessions right. that's the kind of inclusion and i can look at increasing the bucket if it is here and there anywhere between 10 to 20% we can look at increasing the bucket of your search sessions too. so that's the kind of price point we do a 90 days poc with a set metrics in terms of what other kind of increase that you can expect or what is the kind of change in the overall search behaviour on the site right.
rep,that you can expect for a lot of new sites having a very poor site search the other metrics that they judge is the adoption of site search right we have seen that before unbxd there were 10% users and especially in b2b right. because their customers and repeat customers who know that i'll not be able to find a product with search and let me not even try doing that and let me just i know exactly what category i want to see and they they would they would go to those two and four pages and then go to the right category navigate and then pick up the right product right. but once they realize that the search is improved the search adoption also increases right so there could be various different metrics starting from the search adoption to overall ideally the search conversion because you need to make at least 10x of whatever you are spending with us. and that will do only happen by increasing the conversions right so we set those kind of metrics within the first 90 days of the poc and and the idea is to make sure that we achieve those metrics and post 90 days. if you like the solution if you like what you what we have delivered then you can continue and get into an yearly contract if you don't like what what we have delivered then you can walk out of the bond of the contract.
rep,does that does that sound reasonable is it high-low what what are your thoughts on it.
prospect,you know i don't have a real good feel for that because we just have you know you're the you're really the only person we've talked to you about from an outside standpoint i mean we got the inner shot platform and the existing certainty was part of that.
prospect,we haven't done we haven't done a lot with with that search we do have the ability to do more but it doesn't have it's not as robust as this obviously but we haven't we haven't put a lot of effort into it. and we haven't looked at other you know you're the only yet outside platform that we really really we looked at it <> so i don't have a real good feel for that.
rep,okay sure i get that ben and and i completely understand where you're coming from and you would want to do your due diligence right but while you're doing that what i want to want to tell you here and i don't have the metrics on of your site. but if you share the metrics i can actually put on some numbers with regards to what is the kind of revenue that you might be losing every month right. and then if we need to sign an nda i'm more than happy to sign an nda execute an nda and then share a data request sheet if you share that data i can tell you how much you're losing or how much more you can make with unbxd. and while even you're doing this due diligence rights you can still test us for that 90 90 days poc to see the change by yourself. and while you are doing the due diligence if you find say any other company coming and giving you a better demo than than unbxd then we are more than happy to do an a/b test again any competition out there because we guarantee a 10% increase over and above any competition out there in the market right. that's what sets us apart so even if you were to talk to five other companies choose one i would come and say if they are giving you a 5% increase we would we would take it to a five point five percent increase right in your overall conversions that's the 10% increase guarantee that we give.
rep,and that's the reason companies like ib supply chose us over and above  in any other search vendor <>.
rep,so i'm just trying to understand if there could be a possibility for us to come on board and prove our value and prove our value through numbers right purely through numbers purely through increasing conversions and revenue right you make more money and then and see it by ourselves before you even make a longer term decision.
prospect,okay it's good to know.
prospect,it's just we need to take this up the ladder a little bit can we get a copy of this presentation.
prospect,yeah i gave you our average order value is just over a thousand dollars our conversion rate right now is in the like two to three percent range okay of course.
rep,and that's across the site right across the site right.
prospect,and we you know we are a corporate website plus an e-commerce website so we're not a pure play e-commerce right at this point.
rep,alright and do you run any price rules say for a particular set of dealers or our buyers you have a different set of price depending on the location or their country and <>.
prospect,yeah every one of our every one of our customers coming from or individual businesses potentially has a different price on the same product with a very very complicated pricing. just from the standpoint of of we have multiple businesses at play within our within our e-commerce site and then we have huge customer has has individual pricing within that within those catalogs.
rep,right and this changes based on the logins like the customers logins.
prospect,yes customer logs in and the price been and the price been set up with a price list and then the prices they see are different than they see before they're logged in and that's about it.
rep,got it so we we do come with the ability to to set some of these things right that's that's what again sets us apart it's a custom custom solution so the platform is something that we have built but there are always these elements very specific to each and every industry and we come in and also do those custom implementations for our customers.
rep,so just to give you an example ashley furniture store based on where you're coming from the search results page would completely change would completely change on two metrics one is the inventory depending on what what are the closer i would say the warehouses that that they have and two is the pricing again depending on that right where you are coming from versus where the stocks are the prices will completely change. very difficult for an for an end user to understand that but then we were able to implement that for ashley furniture store they have a various they were pretty complex catalogue i would say.
rep,and and you mentioned you have close to 10000 products sorry 50000.
prospect,yeah we we've got roughly yeah we're pushing 50000 products right now we're probably actually going to narrow that down that i think i mentioned that so yeah so it sounds like right now we would be in here just kind of your entry range of around $2000 a month what kind of you in one of your slides the last slide i think you talked about a initial fees what how does that work.
rep,so our typical poc phase is like for ninety days right so for ninety days you paid twenty thousand mr oh sorry my bad two thousand dollars mrr right so that 2000  for month one two thousand for month two two thousand for monthly three that's your six thousand dollars poc. out of that what we do is we use the initial four to six weeks to take you live right say typically six weeks to take you live and the remaining six weeks is for you to test this on a live site and for us to prove the increase in conversions right so that's what the 90 days poc is like the first six weeks for implementation and then the remaining six weeks is for going live. and then that takes care of your complete setup for any specific requirement right over and above the standard solution which could be say running price rules right there could be a nominal fee on top of this which would be in the range of anywhere between say five hundred dollars to three thousand dollars depending on the comp the complication.
rep,and that is where i would i would usually bring in my engineering team for them to understand how many resources they would need how much time they would need and based on that we would do a very custom pricing for any custom implementations over and above the standard solution.
rep,the typical autosuggest any ui elements all that is considered as part of the poc that's that's the standard solution but something like a price rule or say geo-location price changes right any anything of that sort would come into a custom implementation and there could be anywhere between five hundred dollars to three thousand dollars that is one time cost.
prospect,i see okay so there isn't there isn't just out of the box an issue initiation fee or initial or integration fee your anything like that there's just this kind of ninty days.
rep,yes yes i would say that so that would also include a live traffic after the first four to six weeks of implementation it will also include the live traffic on the site which could be at hundred percent at fifty percent it could also be at 2x right. some of the enterprises what they do is during this test phase they actually put 2x traffic right on the on the unbxd system to see how the system would react on on heavy loads right so the test using 2x traffic 3x traffic to see to do the load test right so we take care of so irrespective of what the search sessions are the pricing does still just remains the same within the first 90 days of the poc.
prospect,i see yeah i think just so it doesn't it doesn't automatically increase for if you start doing load testing. okay.
prospect,yeah that sounds great okay sure.
prospect,so if you have if you have some sort of a technical overview how this is the option so it's not like there was a couple of different options of how its implemented so i like to have that i can share with.
rep,yes i'll show you three various different ways of implementation but typically what we are looking at for the poc is an in page ajax and i'll share complete details in terms of how that is being implemented there is another one which is hosted approach we don't usually recommend it. because it creates a negative impact on the seo but if you have it staff limitations you cannot you do not have technical staff internally who can look into things then you might want to go for hosted but but we don't recommend it in pages ajax the recommended way and then on a longer term post poc if you want to do an api integration. that thing we can also do that and also include the steps for that so a detailed implementation document that i'll share with the deck.
prospect,perfect that would be great thank you very much. okay sounds good. we appreciate your time.
rep,same here i know i took a little more than what we were committed for but thanks a lot for your time today and look forward to speaking with you next wednesday.
prospect,so basically helping customers find the part that they're looking for through technical searches or keyword searches on our website that sort of summarizes in a very simple analogy so what i try and do and enable.
rep,so basically helping customers find the part that they're looking for through technical searches or keyword searches on our website that sort of summarizes
rep,got it got it and you know in the process you know just curious to also kind of you know figure out it i'm you run into any challenges with that are you seeing any challenges today you know what is your take in terms of the product discovery experience via customers today.
prospect,i think the challenge is always matching up what customers are searching with with the content that you have you know it's big everyone's everyone's challenged because people can put in the same term multiple ways and try and search different through different avenues to try and get to the same part it's it's all based around perception familiarity and terminology and to compound it at an electronics business so it's technical and there are lots of different sort of trade names and terms that are used to describe the same thing so i ambiguities is a huge deal
rep,got it yeah we kind of see that a lot as well so i just gotta give you you know a quick background of unbxd you know basically we put together an agenda just kind of take you through what we had unbxd help to solve and also kind of you know i know we mentioned we did a customer experience study for newegg dot com just to show you you're just going to replicate the customer experience for your sites today in terms of you know what it is today you know call out some of the areas you're doing really well kind of mentioned to you areas where you know we think there is an opportunity for you to maybe fix in-house or you know maybe leverage a third party solution and and also show you some of the areas where you know unbxd you know as a machine learning platform and can help solve some of those challenges right.
rep,so sometime you know now i know new newegg dot com is just one of the brand
rep,sites for uh for premium farnell do you do you manage your responsible for this experience for all the brand sites or is it just you know one one or the other just trying to see if it newegg is the right site.
prospect,so newegg dot com and farnell  and the farnell dot com includes ten different languages.
rep,got it got it yeah that makes sense and you know so kind of also to introduce you to monal so monal is you know our chief business officer so i am you know i joined an unbxd about a month ago so i'm fairly new so i wanted to make sure i have you know somebody more qualified and monal has a lot of hands-on experience working with some of our large customers so he's kind of gonna you know i also figured out you're on the technical side so that would make more sense to kind of have a technical discussion show you some of the areas where you know we can help to solve and that kind of thing. so just a quick background and unbxd you know we're a six year old company you know we were founded out of the bay area and today we work with about 1200
rep,you're familiar with iv supply they basically a b2b site one of our largest customers you know that we work with.
rep,and and kind of you know what i'm figuring out where is this you know founders basically identified that you know people you know more and more we're searching you know on google and amazon and you know it kind of wasn't the same experience that e-commerce sites today are able to deliver to their customers. and you know so for instance let's say i want to type in blue jeans and google and google would take me to amazon versus let's say i want to type in blue jeans for you know an e-commerce site that actually all had blue jeans and there was a lot of instance where it never really showed up . so so now address you know the relevancy problem a little bit you know we're machine learning platform and you know so kind of you know a let monal know kind of do most of the talking around the solution itself and and take you through some of the findings that that we we figured out from analyzing newegg dot com so monal oh i think you're sharing the screen so of course can you see the screen as well.
rep,great so monal all over to you. okay. perfect justin thank you so much thanks for the patience chris for some reason i had misplaced the report that we prepared for you and i was in sort of a panic we're trying to find it okay so thank you.
rep,so a chris one last question that i have from my site just so they understand the context the platform that you are that you guys are on today is that ibm wcs is that correct. for newark and the solution that you use for site search is this something homegrown or do you guys use like endeca.
prospect,it is.
rep,endeca is endeca perfect all right so this gives me a good context. so let me walk you through if you can see my screen the report that we prepared so the idea behind this report chris is to give you two parts to the context of where we come from one is from our expertise from our background how do we actually evaluate the site and as a customer experience and maybe from your perspective a lot of the business might be.
rep,is it b2c b2b or primarily b2b b2b.
prospect,it's a b2b.
rep,perfect so from that perspective how does a b2b consumer actually go through the experience of trying to use the site search experience on your site and this is just a way of us evaluating from what opportunities there might be there might not be any but i believe that there might be based on what we saw and maybe you are also curious to see you know what else can be can we do because if you are managing that experience maybe not responsible for it but definitely managing that what more tools can you have leverage over because endeca has certain limitations and we have built some system around it that can give you a tremendous amount of control so i will just walk you through all those different elements . so as justin gave you a little background we work with a lot of customers almost 1200 e-commerce sites in 40 plus countries we work with a lot of us customers as well.
rep,ashley furniture express iv supply it's a milwaukee based b2b company.
rep,they sell primarily to government entities like the army military etc .
rep,and we also work with us auto parts.
rep,which is a huge parts company where while there have b2b and b2c there's a very different component in terms of how the search actually happens because of the fitment and i and i'm not sure but maybe well obviously we don't know your business that well but looking from the outside and we felt that maybe that's similarity in terms of fitment might also be applicable to you guys that you sell connectivity and commodity to a lot of b2b businesses which might requirement some compatibility and might be important for that. so here's the five factors across which we evaluate site search experience so starting with the relevance piece then the autocomplete which is the first experience a customer goes through when the experience search the synonyms understanding in terms of what kind of effort that you have to put in today to maintain them. same thing with the error corrections how many do you get what is the effort to and the workflow today and what is it that we can bring to the table as an optimization and what does the whole mobile experience look like and i don't know if a lot of your customers come from mobile or not or maybe the transition is happening where the mobile traffic this year is gonna be higher than last year.
prospect,the transitioning is happening .
rep,yep and do you guys have an app anything or it's just.
prospect,no not yet we do have a mobile site but i'm not sure if there's an app something we've launched fairly recently.
rep,got it so it's not a responsive site is similar mobile adaptive a dedicated site got it from a little perfect and so there's also a different level of experience that you need to consider and we've talked about that as well so here's a scorecard ignore the school site don't worry about it it's just something we like to our marketing team likes to put in but what we wanted to give you is to context one is what is it and how is it that you need to look up look at search what is the evolution of search has been in the past few years and you've been sort of in the forefront from your industry perspective but from the overall technology perspective where has search evolved. up until the early late 20 2000 and 2010-11 timeframe when endeca got bought by oracle search queries usually were one keyword right and google by the way i mean obviously the biggest search engine 60 to 70 percent of the search queries before a few years ago used to be one keyword now 60 to 70 percent of the queries are multi keywords even three keywords and that has what has introduced a complexity in how search works and behaves and scales it's very easy to use endeca to configure and tune your single word queries and maybe some popular 2 word queries but if i am now looking at let's say if i were to go at say newark dot com if i'm looking at semiconductors or connectors and cables i can find a particular component 200 different ways right.
rep,and you cannot manually it's not possible to manually kind of solve relevancy at that scale and what we have found is that there are based on any query that you see from a customer you can group them into one of these twelve segments or query types it is what we call them and we've done a high level grouping or a spectrum qualifiers and structure now what that means is spectrum is are you looking for a very specific product or a type of product or you don't know what product to look for but you have a condition or a symptom that you need to solve or you're not even looking for a product right you're looking for like shipping policy or exchange policy etc. qualifiers are i'm looking for a product but i have some qualifiers around it i'm looking for a six-feet cable or i'm looking for a six feet hdmi cables cetera and then linguistic shortcuts is what is our query structure is how do you actually structure the words of the query so i could write six feet hdmi cable as six single quote or or six feet ft or six feet right and you need to be able to understand all those different parameters and and various ways it's how somebody would might search. so starting with that aspect of it from the search relevance perspective we wanted to get into it and see you know let's say a query type you have is a belden cable and obviously the search results that are being shown today show a lot of the categories around it and maybe maybe this is a way for you to help customer to narrow down a specific category but we believe that when we look at an non search aspect you know the results that you actually see are already there right through the catalog through the navigation menus.
rep,then if you have another query say neon indicators again same thing you get a lot of results through the neon indicators but when you start looking at the category you actually have a category called neon indicators and you can see a very specific way in terms of what that experience really looks like right. another one was the you know rohs fans same thing.
rep,is there something specific to this experience because maybe you can tell us a little bit about it and maybe we can understand that maybe let's say you do neon indicators
prospect,so i think there's there's really three segments in the way customer look for products.
prospect,research design and order.
prospect,i kind of i know i hear your point about the google analytics but there are there's two very segmented ways that the customers search they either use single terms or supplier names or they start using categories or multiple word names which is sort of a long tail of what we've got and so you know based off of that you're gonna find the results are a little segmented .
prospect,so the approach that we've tried to do is for the single word terms which take up the majority of them the results are fairly to the challenge for us and what we're currently working on would be these sorts of multiple word terms were a customers looking for an indicator what an indicator could be something which is either in a piece of equipment it could be on a printed circuit board it could be you know an industrial warning light i mean there's there are a bunch of different ways but someone could use the same thing so you end up having to display a few categories to help them navigate the search and one then one of the things that you will see on our website in an next couple of months will be some refinement so you search for neon indicators and here are some potential categories that you want to choose from.
rep,so you know there is that that sort of narrowing process that you need to go through in order to help navigate the customer so what is exactly that they're looking for.
rep,got it and so there's narrowing how are you planning to do the narrow so let's say i did search for neon indicators would you still because the word indicator exists you would give them and say oh you've searched for indicators here's the five different types and pick one because we understood the word indicators and here's five types so pick one and then narrowing down so the result set.
prospect,yeah so there's a couple ways we do it one is type-ahead you know that's one possible way of doing it the other one is displaying the categories which come up that have indicators in it and then the research that goes behind that is to find you know which keywords customers are most frequently using and then to build the taxonomy around either the technology or the architecture so that the results fragment themselves into the relevant categories that the customers might be looking for.
rep,it's got it so that's that's great insight chris because i wanted to show you two or three different things we're from a technique perspective not that you know you can't do this with endeca but it obviously it's a it's a lot of development and there is still some intelligence missing within endeca to be able to help you make that a little bit smoother transition so let me show you something and i'll walk through some of the other examples and i'll show you something that we believe will give you an idea of how is it that we try to solve that yeah . and let me go back to the presentation now that i understand where this is coming from this actually makes sense so next just some other examples you know like lcd display i think. okay so you brought you to our panel displays in <> and based on our search so this is this is what you essentially talking about right.
prospect,basically the tuning gears to redirect.
rep,got it okay got it.
rep,but have you found chris that this is more of a stopgap in your experience but in reality what you actually want it's likely slightly different more automated help me understand that a little bit.
prospect,i think the challenge become customers put in searches which applied to potentially more than one category or they put in very specific searches where you can't you need to tune the results so the redirects we believe are probably tuning the results and we need to do more of that and i think you know the the website has some functionality that that you can use to help redirect some of that it is yeah i would i would agree with you it is a bit of a stopgap measure and you know no matter how you approach it you know you are either you are fine there's always a challenge of fine tuning a website whether you know you do it through an endeca you do it you know through some other portal or you you know you you do it just through using a database in icloud there is always that interception and then the way we look at it is we have a bucket of terms or keywords that customers use it's combination of you know the frequency and across multiple languages and for the ones which are most frequently used then you need to manage the experience.
prospect,then how you do that right i mean it's better that's big you know what how you do it whether it's during endeca outsourcing in sourcing that's really you know your approach and it depends on dollars for the rest of stuff.
rep,all right absolutely and i'm glad you said that because you're absolutely correct and the over all achieving level chris relevant will all be dead before relevancy side right we all agree on that set and on that one point and nobody can come in and state and say that oh we've solved relevancy so that's never gonna happen i mean google sort of the leader in that space is not being able to completing that so and they still are sort of evolving what what we believe that a slightly different approach that we wanted to take and all and just see your thoughts on that as well is from an approach perspective see today what you said is exactly true either they have they're looking for more like a category so they had they don't know what they really want but they know the aisle they want to go in right if you were to cook in compare them like into a sort of a physical store that maybe sold the same products how would i navigate that store i'll first go to the aisle and and then i'll narrow down from that aisle to exactly what i'm looking for i want to i want this particular nail i'm going to go to their hardware aisle first at home depot and then go to the you know the drawers that have the different types of nails in them and then i'll pick one out based on my needs because i don't know what it will fit my needs and i don't know what's available and then you have this other group of customers who know exactly what they want because either they've bought it before or they know from some other source that this is the right product for them so they might come in and know something about that product you know the upc or the item code or the enough description to say i want one and a half inch you know roof construction nail something like that right and they get into that very specific city in both instances let me show you how we i want to just show you something really quickly because i think this will really address what we might be talking about there we go so here's what we had done for one of our customers can you see my screen i hope that.
rep,okay so here i searched for mobile now the challenge here is very similar to the indicator one right if i search for mobile i have cell phones smart phones mobile headphones cases covers bluetooth etc i don't know what mobile category are usually referring to so the one way we realized was there's two types of customers one who needs that help to guide them and narrow them down the other customer which may be very rare in your case because it's more b2b is coming in and just browsing and don't have an intent to buy this just want to come in and check it out maybe they want to know what costs there is their price shopping whatever the case might be and they don't necessarily want to get forced down as particular path so what we did was at the top here the unbxd technology figures out automatically when i search for mobile we figure out what are the categories that are related to mobile and second we also look at the clickstream data the analytics data and we can deploy our own tags to do that to figure out which order we should put them in so we know that most people who search for mobile come in and search for smartphones and then screen protectors is the last one and so we will order them in that order let's say over time screen protectors become more popular that will start to percolate up top and re-change the order in that sense. but we still always show products for that best category that we believe customers are mostly going to come in and see because that customer who wants to be guided will click here the one who doesn't care about being guided just wants to come in and browse is going to want to start seeing products. and that's the balance that we've that we have found is very important to structure that way and i think what we were also going to see so here two components to this let's say neon indicators one could be a category because you clearly have a category called neon indicators but i might also have come in and just typed in indicators so if i type in indicators maybe i want to show you the incandescents or the indicator lenses or the neon indicators and maybe you know the struggle the industrial indicators etcetera the toolkits and stuff and we can show that of chop to guide them and say well which indicator are you talking about but when they do search for neon indicators one ways for you to do the redirect clearly but that's not a scalable solution because i might just come in and say a type of neon indicator and suddenly we can redirect one word and you were back to that same segment of how do we actually solve that query and so what we feel is that if a customer searches for neon indicators the technology will figure out that the customer is looking for either that category because we have the access to the taxonomy and the category data or even if they had a feature around the neon indicator for them to come in and say let's say 125 volts neon indicator if that's what it is but it's a green neon indicator we will automatically know to show them the relevant results because we have built a semantic search engine that figures that process house it understands that you're looking for an indicator which might be on neon in terms of a category and in his green in color i'll give you a simple example brown leather jacket we know that jacket is a product leather is the fabric attribute and brown is the color attribute the way we've been able to build this out is we've scanned almost a hundred thousand e-commerce sites index almost two hundred and fifty million products and ran an algorithm a machine learning algorithm that figured out how to parse a product type versus a product attribute versus a category into from a limitation perspective.
rep,so we know that endeca cannot solve for you any longtail queries unless you manually go in and solve the relevancy that is where we come in and solve it we know that unless you create those redirect rules and endeca cannot figure out the redirection we'll come in and solve this for you if you wanted to.
rep,do you guys by the way just as a side question do you guys use endeca for your category pages also i'm assuming
rep,oh you don't do that got it so does your marketing or merchandising team not come in and optimize the category pages like if i were to go to say neon indicators as a category this page is not optimized by merchants at all .
prospect,not correct not currently.
rep,is there is there an interest to do that and and
prospect,<> vector project so let me back sir first and that sort the journey that we've taken is the problem with auto parts versus our business is there is no standardization in the auto parts world and the customers that dealt with there are auto standards they're just not enough and the products that we sell that we can really focus around specific terms and sort of industry standards that you know globally you can you can work with.
prospect,so well most of our what we do and most of our competitors do is create their own taxonomy and then what we've done in the last couple of year is to look at the keywords the customer search and to start building the taxonomy around the keywords so whether they put in indicators blue to mobile that the most relevant terms are are matched so we start activating things like type-ahead what we're doing now is beginning to match in a couple of different ways so we're taking you know neon indicators is actually a great example because you're right you can find it a number of ways and there's there's probably two things we need to do one is a better grouping of you know neon indicators you correctly pointed out or in lighting products and they're probably in a couple other categories we need to reduce those number of categories and then give the customer an abbreviated list so that whether they search for indicators neon indicators lcd indicators that you know it aligns with keywords that they most frequently use and the choices are display where we're going below that you'll probably get to and you started discuss is really the attribution which both is an internal and external search so we are looking at the long tail of how they search and you're right 125 volts is the survival do not happen first attribute so when google searches we're going to change our url structure so that whether it's the category and attribute or a brand that we can differentiate it and this will help  further kind of slice up that the different functions that'll make it the site easier to svroll and easier to search for different values so yeah i think we're we're saying the same things but it's just a long path of how to get that.
rep,absolutely and i and i think you know what i was trying to say you're absolutely correct auto industry i mean they've been around for a hundred and twenty years so they have no choice but to organize a little bit better and not having an industry standard is okay what i think the challenge here chris is you have the data i mean we talked about hundred and twenty five words right and i can see here in the filters i did filter 125 volts and the still and this product still seems to show up so you have the attribution data you have the actual content data maybe some of the categorization could be optimized that's absolutely true from a navigation perspective but we believe that with the data that you have and this is obviously something you can test but we believe that with the data that you have in the filters that data the way you organized it we have the capacity to solve queries like the neon indicators like 125 volt neon indicators while you're still continuing to using endeca to optimize some of your single word queries and more frequent queries because you're single more queries probably has more traffic and your long tail queries does not have that much traffic but your long term queries probably make up 40 maybe 50 percent of your query base and 50 percent of your single word query maybe 16 percent a single work queries so how do you optimize that 40 percent you clearly cannot do that today with endeca at scale that's number one number two is the ability to optimize is still manual you still have to do a lot of development on the back end to able to move the needle from say 60% to 65% and we believe and and i obviously i this is looking from the outside in mind you chris so this is not that we're coming in and being cocky enough to say oh we solved autoparts world we can solve yours that's clearly not the statement we were making what based on the data that i see and the data that is already organized the queries that we ran and had an opportunity we know that we can easily fix those. one last thing i wanted to show you because it is a b2b world let's say i start to type in this  125 volt neon indicator something along those lines or.
rep,let's say maybe i should is this a part number you guys makes skus searchable.
prospect,skus are searchable on endeca .
rep,perfect so if i were to do this and clearly it finds the perfect product right here one another idea that we've tried and this is something comes from the grocery world and i'll give you the context as to how we sort of come across came across this in grocery and i don't know if this is the same behavior in your world also or not but in b2b we've seen typically the same behavior will see that customers come in and buy a lot of products in a single transaction <> or some that i might be hosting this weekend i need to buy something normally that i don't buy so we also provide some commonly searched terms some popular brands even though it does not contain bread and i remind you and categories okay and sorry just clicked on something and this we believe has turned out to be a much more richer experience and by the way is something like a merchandising messaging there might be important something that you guys are trying to get rid of inventory or just want to get people to know of a particular brand new product you also have that messaging available right here and i thought that something similar if i were to even obviously if i know exactly what i want to buy and i've bought this from you before i will come in and type in that same number you know why do i have to click here go to that results page find it maybe i need to find the quantity and stuff like that maybe there's that experience that i need to go to change that we can bring all of those different elements into the autocomplete also so the one also another way chris to look at it is that the autocomplete is not just a necessarily narrow down of how the customer is behaving yes it is if i am typing indicators you do want to make sure and get them to an indicator category quickly but also when i'm typing for a very specific set of product set is it possible for me to start showing that product and be able to order right there from the auto complete rather than having to go through the experience of the pdp and then come here change the quantity and a add to cart all set. and all of this information we can certainly we can come up with some certain ui elements that can give you the same experience right there in the auto complete because the because and you know i mean if i just start to type in that number i know that it's that's the only product that i need to show repeating this experience is not that big a deal. but it still has to be extremely fast and efficient so.
prospect,yeah yeah no you're exactly right so we started with the the keyword type-ahead the means that we work on next and i think i mentioned that we were going to we were fine-tuning the category that to get the attribution right is because those attributes that
rep,you type in will be the type ahead so the next step for us is to actually take something like indicator and then add in as you type in the numbers it'll pull up the voltage and then the next i think probably the first three attributes will kind of help define the type ahead but it's basically what you're looking in that description. so yeah i think we're trying to get the same thing and you can do that through endeca. got it got it now you can do that too endeca but chris is there like i'm assuming there's some sort of development that needs to be done and.
prospect,routes and so we have natural processing for that.
rep,got it got it perfect so let me walk you through some of the other elements from that perspective so we talked about the autosuggest piece synonyms and stemming.
rep,how is the experience today because i know with within deca today all sorts of synonyms and stemmed words we we know that you have to create a synonym on the back end otherwise it will necessarily solve that is that still true today do you guys go through ecstatic experience today.
prospect,we used yeah it's it's been a horrible experience for us in the past and and we same sort of conversation we've had to clean up taxonomy the challenge with was the stemming is because we weren't consistent across the website the stemming experience was awful and so you know there was the source which was used for the synonyms the stemming is built into a little bit of the way that we build our taxonomy but we need to expand that so we've been developing our own database of synonyms and will you actually we can use the database within ibm to really you to take that stemming and build it out as a as a look-up on search. and it's not too much penalty.
rep,got it okay so the one thing we wanted to share on the stemming piece is that unbxd solves stemming out of the box so if you have a web camera or webcam if you have a center or central game gaming cable cabling all of those stemmed words automatically solved out of the box because we use a and we also use in nlp but we've also built nlp into our system that on in real time it is able to actually solve that stemming problem without having to rely on synonyms we also have built a synonym library but i'm sure that your synonym library is probably much richer from an industrial jargon perspective because you would have more direct context to them than we would but as far as stemming is concerned absolutely a solved problem. and stemming could be look from a linguistic shortcut perspective or stemming could be from a just an english word perspective say charger versus discharging versus volts versus volt all of those who do not have to create any kind of synonyms on the background to solve that. the other piece was the error correction that is also something that we've built as an algorithm and not actually a synonym library where we are able to solve 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes out of the box without having any kind of synonym library on the back end.
rep,and and that is something that we are also very proud of from that perspective because i know that as the catalog gets bigger and bigger the biggest challenge is to create those permutations and combinations of spelling mistakes as synonyms and endeca and to be able to scale that right .
rep,how big is the catalog just out of curiosity chris .
prospect,with content about a million and a half part numbers.
rep,got it when you say content is like manufacturer guides usage guides etc or do you have actual like blogs and stuff like content articles and stuff .
prospect,content would the it's correctly linked to a category it has descriptions images attribution it has technical document so it's uh we can research <> .
rep,also there is a catalog without content that might deserve.
prospect,a little more categories that should be and that we're slowly we're slowly getting rid of though.
rep,i see so million and half so that is well the million and a half is data the full catalog is probably more five million got it okay so that's that's a significant amount of data especially for from the autocorrection piece.
rep,do you see chris spelling mistakes happen a lot oh and he'll be.
prospect,in we're not even there yet monal it's a it's a massive piece of work and you know the challenge for us was stemming is that it's not out-of-the-box it you know the examples that you type in you know it can be a customers looking for you know a nine position indicator switch well that would be nine way nine contacts nine in there's a bunch of bunch of different ways that you can look forward and it's really coming up with all of those different alternative that is the way customers most frequently searched the weather it tends in you know way your ways but that part is not a big deal the spelling t's you're absolutely right especially when you get into multiple languages it's a huge piece of work but i think we've got a approach the the current work that we're doing in order to get categorization refined and get
rep,okay perfect so again just to repeat myself 85 to 90% of the spelling mistakes we and i we've tested this against multitude of databases we've tested it against new the product catalog that we have exported from different websites and scans for different websites there's a wikipedia the english dictionary catalog and then there's also some industry catalogs out there that we've tested this against and usually 85 to 90% of the spelling mistakes were able to resolve ourselves and the last piece go ahead.
prospect,so just on the on the spelling mistakes i mean that one is obviously something we're not doing and how many languages are you are you doing today.
rep,so today we do that obviously from english perspective but we could support some of the latin character set based languages we don't do the chinese japanese arabic languages yet it's the latin character set based is what we can do.
rep,the percentage of the probability of success does get reduced in the other language is not english it goes down to around 60% roughly but english we definitely have can push 85 to 90%.
rep,how many languages do you guys have the site on.
prospect,10 and i could check 10.
rep,got it how's this mostly character latin character or romania and everything else got it chinese .
prospect,yeah yeah so i mean the big ones obviously are french german italian portuguese chinese.
rep,chinese got it okay so how do you is there a different team chris that does the other like.
prospect,we have a whole translation team.
rep,pretty amazing all right yeah and now.
prospect,that's the piece as well because i don't know what you're doing is is you know you're describing this to me and then we're doing this but we're doing it 10 language.
rep,yeah no i totally get it i totally understand that and last was the the mobile piece again i think coming from a mobile experience perspective that whole big basket example that i showed you the grocery example i believe would be a much richer and much more faster experience because and you might see and maybe this is a behavior test and you might already know this a lot of customers coming in are mobile especially from b2b we usually know exactly what they're looking for you're not doing a lot of discovery on mobile phones. because you know one day you're not gonna go through navigation because it takes six or seven clicks to do navigations so search is primary on mobile but in when they search they typically have they can't type in six words right they'll maybe to one word and maybe two words at the most and typically they'll like to know exactly what they were buying they might get into the item ids and stuff like that. so that whole grocery type experience could be very very important in terms of helping them get to that product and get in and get out very quickly. and that's it that's that's the that's the solution chris.
prospect,you know i totally agree with you on the mobile is that something that you know we started we have a presence on we need to do more and so you know i think everything that you've said is aligned with our strategy i think the challenge for us to engage is that for the work that we we're currently doing in order to kind of go back to your indicator example to build that out and to make it work correctly is already set forth where were very much committed to a process and resources to kind of have that that indicator functionality with stemming type-ahead and then what you didn't talk about was really some of the url work that you could possibly do and really optimize name of site with google's make sure that you got all of your pages correctly indexed and searchable you know that's probably a big piece for us. the synonyms are also that that key forest i think the other thing that i would suggest for you is it's also possible to have the same part number in multiple categories. and you know that's something that like synonym synonyms were also doing and when a customer searches for something to return multiple categories which we don't do today so you know you might have the auto say the neon indicator but you might also want to return maybe some of the associated parts that go with the wiring cable i mean those are things you could do whether you do it you know through the search you can also use some very good algorithms which which are available you know that will crawl your website and and give you all of the associated accessory parts.
prospect,so i think that part is very clear the you spoke about the auto correct spelling you know we just were we can't get there yet we have to do this stuff first before we can do it cuz if you try and get to the spelling mistakes until you've got consistent data or you know a process to to really have some deformity across your your content then you're just chasing and fail.
rep,so chris just getting the data piece correct for if you talk about 1 point 5 million products with content and 5 without our total.
rep,how how are you guys scaling that i mean this can't be done manually clearly are you going back to the manufacturers and instilling and saying you guys gotta give us the absolute you know.
prospect,what we do is we use like catalyst and so we're able to take all of the searches and really see which ones are our most popular number of searches a billion or something like that.
prospect,you know you have a stupid number so from that you can start sifting out the long tail from the ones which are most frequently done and then you know based off of that you can really look at the searches three different weight categories as wire part number and we don't want you you've built that dissection then you can start refining how you do it i mean we might go to suppliers we we do get content from them the challenges that no it's theirs it's their stuff it's not always aligned with the way that that we create our content yeah the structure is not the standardized structure ties that so it's kind of directional but at the end of the day you really need our own stuff to make your website work right so maybe that's being the process that if you know it it's one of those things where you work category by category and so you may go into the neon indicators you tune it . and then you keep on through evolution you're making thousands of change it but those changes collectively will that experience that you start building into your website through improving the tectonic africa description and then start feeding it with the ability sit in different part number and and then fine tune your accessories and the relevancy of your search results. if we found that if you start working at all the time then that's what makes it there and the problem with outsourcing is no back to your indicator example there there's that's fine that maybe what they have but the man they could also be looking for anemic neo an indicator because they want to replace them with an lcd else last longer their lower power there's a bunch of things that unless you have that knowledge.
prospect,you're not going to be able to put in place then the same thing with some of your the words that you peck we try and pick words that can be translated in ten languages so there there are things that you know become part of our decision-making process that our knowledge is our experience we already have the content that defines and publishing system that we can work with and deliver that. so there are pieces of it that we can outsource and we do and you know that is sort of some of the ongoing work you can't do everything but some of the heavy lifting yes we can work with consult to help us with and we give them databases and they'll write scripts and refine it for us then from some of the work that you're you're talking about tuning that they can build pieces of it but then essentially become to a point bau activity is just that becomes part of art this the heavy lifting to initially get it to that point they do but then we really become the champions of having to manage an ongoing thing . and that's you know just the adjustment that you have to make we haven't made all of them things like you said the spelling mistakes haven't touched it and i agree with you huge issue.
rep,so there's.
prospect,always room for improvement.
rep,got it so chris one aspect of it and i'm just trying to strategies in place to to improve this on top of endeca i don't know what the timeframe that is i'm assuming it's the next step next quarter or so assuming that things worked out good for talk quarterly is there an opportunity one after that quarter to reassess and say okay if you've done this let's see the improvement any because that's new benchmark right if you are able to do some improvement yourself that becomes a new benchmark that you can base off of any any comparative technology. the second piece is because you are not going to go through the spellcheck piece yet is there an opportunity maybe sooner to come in and say okay we we make an api call to endeca you get zero results and maybe at the same time you make an api call to unbxd with our index of catalog that we can give them and we do get results we get zero results for endeca let's show unbxd results we really show something and try to overcome the the spell check piece or maybe the stemming piece any time you get a no good results or you have low performing queries. let's say for example the longtail stuff your freaky three words or four words etc so very something very specific to leverage that aspect of it with your existing catalog and then maybe in the meantime you are still continuing to improve your system could that be some sort of an opportunity for unbxd to come in and help where you know you're not gonna be able to spend time for the next quarter or two.
prospect,i mean it could be it's obviously it's a question that it's definitely a possibility i think the challenge becomes that we're doing the same thing you might have the database already set up for which would be an advantage for someone stemming certainly it would potentially be a marginal improvement but we would essentially be doing the same thing. so we have next year two years mapped out terms of what we want to do and how we want to do it it'll it'll change a thousand times.
rep,surely.
prospect,you know the concept is no relatively known how about.
prospect,go ahead. go ahead.
rep,<>. no i was going to say that the whole stemming teams i get that's what you working and i wasn't really wearing about the same or the synonym things it was purely looking at it from the autocorrection piece which you've said i know there's multiple languages that you need to work on first or the requirement is there but i'm assuming english is as major share of the revenue anyways could be at least come in for the english language and help you solve that one corner case that you know you're not gonna be working on in the next two quarters and and from an investment perspective it's not just so much cost to use unbxd let's say for example. let's say the financials work out from that perspective and the roi that you're getting because of that pays for itself and then over time over two years you get there you stop using unbxd for that particular corner case is that have you guys i know you.
rep,the only reason i brought this up is because you said that you know there are certain things you do outsource because you can't solve everything and i figured that if this if the spell check piece the autocorrection piece is lined up to be overtime in the long term and there's a lot of other stuff that needs to be done first maybe in the parallel you could come in and just arguments like we said we can sit right next to endeca and it's not an on-prem it's a it's a sas solution. so you don't have to install or anything like that it's simple api call you get zero results from endeca you get some results from unbxd give it a try our responses will be in the exact same format as endeca so your application doesn't have to change either so you get exactly the same result set or the format for the result set. and you were able to make the decision easily enough to say show one or the other.
prospect,yeah my i guess the the answer would be that to do it in english on corner case the amount of work it would take for us to set it up you know that call sounds simple for you but for us we have to go through a bunch of middleware or another thing that it does become quite a complicated case and unless that is a significant amount of money quite frankly just not worth doing i mean we've even looked at translation the same way where we we've had companies come to us say well your site is japanese but it's in english and we'll do it for you and it'll just be one call but i'll tell you to set that up and get it working in a business environment which is already overloaded unless it is worth a ton of money it's just not going to happen you're not even gonna make that priority but there's too many others too many bigger things in front of it.
rep,okay okay that's there i just wanted to find a way to throw it out there and see lets throw it out so that that's that makes sense.
rep,so yeah chris from your perspective i know obviously there have been budgets put in place what do you feel from our perspective we can do to help is there should we hang tight for another quarter you go through some of the improvements and you feel that okay maybe now is the time for some of the long term queries where even with the attribution you know endeca i may not be able to necessarily come in and solve that you know how can is that how we would want to look at it i'm sure there's opportunity options changes all the time what are your thoughts on that.
prospect,i think for 2017 we are relatively blocked.
prospect,it's not a quarter by quarter segment it's some work that we have started that because of the size scale and complexity of implementing it there's really a it's at least a year to be honest but yeah i mean i don't mind if you touch base by quarter but you're gonna find the answer it is going to be the same we plan out quarters i have to.
prospect,so you're probably already int next year than to get on anybody's page.
rep,i see got it okay no that's fair that's a good insight because you know a lot of companies work quite differently and so that's that's good to know.
prospect,you know it was revolutionary and the business value was there where you can say hey look you know the spender came in no we can instantly solve this problem revenue stream would be this i mean you could fit anything no you can do it in a couple of quarters but this is not conversation there are a lot of people to come to us with offering that actually i think yours is is a very good one it was a good presentation and i think what you're doing makes a lot of sense it just happens to be that we're sort of on a parallel track same. and our commitment or maybe a little further ahead then then what you're what you're suggesting so i know there's there's not enough of what you're telling me that i would do differently than i already have planned out probably the next know your your <>.
rep,got it no that's that's totally fair well i do appreciate because i know i'm going over the allocated time so i do appreciate your sharing and this was really fantastic feedback from for us to all to learn from that perspective so thank you is there anything that you have questions on you'd like to know that i can i can share and elaborate on.
prospect,no no we're not really i mean i you know i like to hear presentations from different parts of the industry know it's good for us for two reasons wanted either confirms that what we're doing make sense or you know you get some of them where it's a wake-up call that hey you're screwing up and you need to to fix it or there's a better there's a better way of doing something i think in this case like you've got a very good approach it makes sense good examples that were that were relevant. so you know i appreciated their context and you know it's an education for both of us so you know stay in touch but i don't see an opportunity you know in the short term.
rep,oh that's that's fair and chris if you were ever in the downtown area or maybe april we could grab a beer sometime maybe
rep,hey so michael before before i get started you know i wanted to do this why customers buy from you and if there is to us to say a site search and that you're trying to solve today so that i can focus on those areas during the rest of the conversation also presentation.
prospect,well a lot of products that we carry are unique to us nobody else carries them we designed them and so we've got a lot of exclusive product so that's one thing and overall i think we carry a kind of a high quality mixed products so in kind of a high-end customer base.
rep,oh and yet yeah business is still all of it b2c or do you also have a b2b businesses that you are already in.
prospect,i mean we have sort of a b2b component but it's like interior designers.
prospect,so we have kind of a discount program for those people<>.
rep,okay it is it still on the same portal or is it a different website.
prospect,same portal.
rep,same portal okay also micheal just curious like how many products do you carry today on the site.
prospect,on the site right now.
rep,the skus howmany skus you have.
prospect,couple of thiusand.
rep,a couple of thousands okay.
prospect,looks like about 1500 or online currently.
rep,okay 1500 awesome great and last two things before i get started i know i've been bombarding you with the questions but just just trying to get a high-level perspective wasn't what's the platform the commerce platform that use website.
prospect,its netsuite the e-commerce advanced platform.
rep,okay that's fine and how about the search functionality is at the default netsuite that you're using or are using any other search functionality or any other plugins on wisteria.
prospect,it's the default one.
rep,okay got it great that kind of gives me good high level overview and anything in specific that you want me to cover during this during our conversation today around site search.
prospect,no <>.
rep,okay initial so as we as we go through the presentation any questions you have just feel free to let me know if anything in specificity makes more sense about about your website feel free to pause me and i can i can walk into our i can do a much more deeper dive into that particular topic.
rep,but on high-level what i want to do today is a little about who we are b i've done a little bit of research on a site want to kind of create a baseline in terms of what are the areas of opportunities where we see we can come in and and make a difference c show you some of the sites search problems that we solved today and lastly we can discuss any other questions you have a pricing implementation discussion or are any other questions i can take those does that work for you.
prospect,yeah that's great.
rep,okay awesome so to talk about those we're a five and a half year old company based off our headquartered in sunnyvale california with offices in chicago and back in india we have 120 plus customers and brands in the us itself and 1200+ global websites that we cater to today we serve over 1. 5 billion interactions a month which is larger than the top five ecommerce sites put together than the us from from our current customers our other customers are very implementing with.
rep,from from fashion we are working with express it's a live site debora lipman rue 21 is something which is in implementation right now. hardware is iv supply us auto parts is in implementation with seventy-five million products from electronics working with hh greg again something in implementation but scoshche sylvain itrenueredirect are something which is which is live. ashley home furniture store i think more from your verticle is something that's live bed bath and beyond it is an implementation.
rep,from a platform perspective we can implement or we can integrate with any e-commerce platform being netsuite or a homegrown ecommerce platform as well and what sets us apart especially on netsuite is that none of the other traditional site search vendors they can only do a hosted domain approach of implementation and i can i can dive deeper into that doing the implementation conversation but on high-level what what they are doing is they are creating a a sub domain on c name for your site so say instead of wisteria dot com it would be searched dot wisteria dot com every every time someone is trying to search on the site they get redirected to searched dot wisteria dot com and and and they start serving the results. and that's the typical approach in its suite because of the limitations that netsuite has by itself which is ideally not right for an e-commerce site because it negatively impacts your seo. whereas we have the ability to come in and do a netsuite implementation through in page ajax and then most of our customers are currently today on in pages ajax which does not impact your seo negatively at all. and i will show you what what what that also looks like the ajax implementation.
prospect,so a quick you have currently clients on the net suite sca platform.
rep,yes i can i can i can show you some of those i'm not sure of sca but i i know that we have few customers on on netsuite.
prospect,okay well there there's there's two platforms for netsuite one is their old their old platform and then the other one is sca which there are several versions out but they're all very similar single page application architecture versus the the old site builder style which is a kind of more traditional web site.
rep,okay sure no let me let me quickly and because i know that we have some customers on netsuit i'm sure of what version they are on. so i've already sent them out to remember maybe before we end this call i should be able to give you some tips.
rep,sounds good so let me start with what i've reviewed on on your site right and then this is not to criticize <> and this is terms of what are the areas of opportunities we see on. so michael the first thing i looked at on your site was the autosuggest functionality it's good that you have a visual autosuggest with the images of the products some of the products showing up there but it's still on guiding me right i put in so far <> maybe this is hard coded based on the best intelligence and brings in you have put these items in a particular way right but it does not guide the customer does not help the customer to narrow down to some of the things some of the subcategories of so far if you are even say table even could be a coffee table could be a pet cited right various different kind of tables so it does not guide the customer and i'll show you how you can start guiding the customers when they through auto suggest also what i noticed that say and i look forward <> so far it gives me no results within the autosuggest. and that's another area of opportunity and i look for the site search speed in general i'm tried for dining table as a query you will see that that from some other <> the speed is very low it's it's over one thousand two hundred thousand twelve thousand milliseconds actually in one case if there's it is more than eight thousand nine thousand milliseconds typically should be within 300 milliseconds this is what is recommended. then i looked at relevancy and this was interesting i was.
prospect,come back one step so the this is to run the you are all listed there.
prospect,gotcha. okay.
rep,yes. this is the search user page that you have right.
prospect,mmhmm yeah so this is this is not not the drop-down search but they if you click results in the in the drop-down or hit enter in that field you to go to the full search result page and that's what your <>.
rep,great so then i looked for the your website and i was going through website looked your browser reviews and found blog that's his top ten must listed down nice chair <> this was an exact search that i was trying then i look for more of a i would say a product search meaning say blue sofar right then i'm looking for blue as a colour attribute.
prospect,sorry can you go back one slide one previous sorry to the to the grouping of the three.
rep,this one.
prospect,yeah that was off the blog they're all product name is wrong.
rep,they're all in the blogs by the way.
prospect,i don't get it.
rep,this storyboard is what you call it right and then the top ten must-haves we are falling for screenshots in there in here.
prospect,yeah they misspelled paprika it's spelled harp rica.
rep,but i i thought it was spelled the same way on your site as well just give me a moment.
prospect,yeah the the product names are correct on the site it's it's supposed to be hair on hide danish chair not hide on here and what was that rk rk bone relief stool is the park a bone relief stool but even it is transpose park a relief see yeah there is a  very good.
rep,this actually this opens up an another opportunity for us also and and walk you through that element is also error tolerance in terms of how how good is the site think it has error tolerance in terms of correcting some of these spelling mistakes it should be in any way which could be say someone coming from the blog and copy psting misspelled query or a word or say they themselves trying to type it and then typing it say misspelling i will walk you through that right. so that is also a very important piece of site searchable yep then i look for say blue sofa i mean something that gave me the result photo frames you have quite a few photo frames on the right hand side you see but when i actually search for photo frames it limits me only to two of these the others are probably not photo frames but some sort of frames or wall arts not right products look for gifts under dollar hundred and i did that because you also have a category for for gifts gifts under doll 100 but when i type this right which is also a natural language query returns as a result page. then i look for chairs chairs did give me first full of of results and as a customer i say wanted to buy the cheapest chair so i quickly did a sort by function that you have a price low to high and it actually returned our change to others on the first fold to pillow covers. then look for stemmed words bench versus benches again the intent here does not change singular or plural customer is looking for bench ideally but the set of results that that you see is different they are all benches no doubt but not the best way to kind of show the results it is important that we start understanding the intent of the customer over and above what what they are actually typing .
rep,and then i look for rug versus rugs against in your pool gave me different set of results this is the spill correction of the still check error tolerance that i was talking about i try to misspell a few words to see if i was if the site was able to correct it. tried wood dresser with a single s glass tests with a single s and give me zero results then look for wood chairs without the i you know people come from smaller screens tabs mobile phones or even on desktop their typing fast right they end up making these mistakes. so trying to simulate that and see if i was to i was able to get any results um then i compare your category pages and search pages and and it's important because your category pages has the best the most are the best curated set of results on the site right. so at any one point in time if someone is searching for something that's within the category it's important that you start redirecting them to the category page or at least show them the same set of results in the same order because the merchants are setting up these on based on their business logic in the best way right on the category page. but here you'll notice pillows versus  pillow has category page on the left hand side a pillow search are totally different set of results.
rep,then personalization right it's sofa now even within sofa it is important to understand from where the customer is coming from what is a what is their persona what are their affinities could be towards brand towards color and start personalizing some of the elements say a typical example is say a brown leather jacket right now there could be 100 brown leather jackets on a apparel site or even in your case a sofa sofa the the what the kind of so far the people like from google versus from urban areas could be totally different right so the moment you start understanding the geolocation and start personalizing this the the probability of them converting is much higher. so that was a quick overview does this make sense do you see these as areas of opportunity on the site i'm surely must be aware of some of these and must be fixing them at your end but just wanted to create a baseline and not criticize wants work at your end.
prospect,you know totally that's great go ahead.
rep,okay so before i get onto the solution right why search typically we we have noticed that our customers actually see there's there's a search influencing at least twenty to forty percent of the revenue on the site and might be coming from google they might be coming from some other site copy paste the title you are the product that they are looking for and and you know copy it from from one one site or one location and then start pasting it on various different sites and quickly start searching for products that they are looking for. not just that but 80% of the visitors abandon the site if they're not able to find something right and they come on the site they search and and and not to forget that these are the customers who are 60% more probable to convert because they're searching . and 80 percent of them just abandon if they are not able to find what they are looking for we change this for express and then i wanted to put this as a quote here from the express ceo he addressed this in in one of his press conversation after the the q2 reports from express and then after implementing unbxd going live with us. why unbxd high-level business technology merchandising controls mobile performance sla on business we understand your business your unique differentiator why customers buy from you and then and start replicating that on the overall product discovery experience that the customer has on your site. site search being so intrinsic for each site something that works for you would not work for your competition or say something that works for ashley home furniture so today might not be the best thing for your site right.
rep,there is always something unique about a business so we trying to identify that and start implementing that are you know including that the overall discovery experience. technology yes solving the site such problems at a different scale all together did  you see an example us auto parts has 75 million products a different challenge to solve with ashley furniture so they have a distributed catalog based on the location the catalog or the items that they're showing changes and also the price changes. so every retailer that we work with especially on the enterprise site they have specific challenges that they're trying to solve and we're helping them do that. so that's the kind of technology that we have build. merchandising controls we believe that that we can only take our experience to 90% the any other site search solution can probably not even take it to 40 to 50 but here we can take it to 90% and the remaining 10% experience is something that that we give control to you and your merchants because there are business logics there are business rules that you and your team is much more aware of or is expert at right it's a promoting products promoting new arrivals inventory right. what are the kind of products that you want to put so those are the things that you would want to also include given and these are ways
rep,they simply our business right so that's the control we give you through our merchandising dashboard and i'll walk you through that. then we have mobile meaning all our features are actually something that works on a mobile site be it adaptive be it responsive.
rep,do you have a mobile site today is that adaptive responsive.
prospect,it's responsive.
rep,awesome so all the all of the relevancy or the say the technology pieces will surely work on it the ui elements i'll walk you through few examples and few snapshots in terms of how we address the the mobile ui as well and then performances and sla we penalize ourselves for any downtime on the site and we guarantee an roi for every dollar that you spend with us and i can also show you some of it. here is a quick snapshot in terms of how we are impacting the conversion rate and revenue for some of our customers and this is we didn't the 60 to 90 days of them going live furniture and home decor is actually for ashley furniture so we we help them increase the conversion rate by 60% and then revenue by 29% the fashion atg is actually express and then we have b to b which is iv supply on solr variant we also influenced their revenue by 58 percent right. and so some of the high-level numbers that i just wanted to show you in terms of what is it that you can expect from unbxd in terms of numbers are in terms of increase in revenue and conversion rates. the catalog. that's a pottourri group it's potpourri it's a catalog.
rep,here are the high level
rep,elements are the competence of the unbxd site search i'll walk you through some of these but if you like it we can obviously get into a much more detailed discussion and into it into a deep dive or a technical deep dive into each of these elements but high level autosuggest core search technology advanced search again a next level to the overall relevancy solving the relevancy. verticalyse is industry model understanding what industry the customer is in and always there is there are there are things very particular about an industry and we kind of tune the system accordingly the back and merchandising dashboard i'll walk you through this in terms of how easy it is for say even a non techie merchant maybe at your end to control some of the elements on search mobile optimization and then the unbxd reporting which will give you a little insight in terms of overall search performance on your site.
rep,so let me not bowl you with these slides and actually show you a few of the live examples of our customers with regards to the auto suggests. this is the first interaction that the customer makes with the site right and it's important that you start guiding in the customer in the right start exposing them the right categories brands products that they would be more likely to buy on the site. and and i will show you few examples in terms of how they are solving specific challenges of these customers by not providing them just a template approach to autosuggest here are your top four queries or top four products and then you start showing that for all the customers but we have customized this for each and every customer so vacparts they sell vacuum cleaner parts or say other home appliance parts this is actually that insight this is how it used to look like customer so vacparts they sell vacuum cleaner parts or say other home appliance parts this is actually that. insight this is how it used to look like before unbxd  hope you can okay hope you can see my screen.
prospect,not really.
rep,the vacparts screen this is the old site this is the new site so because they used to have two different search boxes for two kinds of visitors on their site one who who used to search by part number others who used to search by model name right they didn't know the part number they will come for a model name and then start in further parts which came in they said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box and also at the back end you have to now start optimizing two search boxes all together. so instead what we did is build something like this the moment i type bissel on the left hand side you see all the parts for the bissel on the right hand side you will see all the models for the bissel and then some of the top searches for the same here is another customer thirty five million dollars in revenue based of texas they sell military a parallel to us citizens for them brand in their categories and some of the popular products was important so this is what we will for them nike the moment i start typing ni shows me the nike the most popular brand then some of the categories within nike some of the other brands <>so the top queries starting with ni and then some of the popular products from nike. say over a period of time this fourth black boot became more popular than this would come a position one and others would come down here what we designed for express say the moment i start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories and when i browse through these shows me the popular products on the left-hand side within each of these categories . and last one i know this is not from a vertical but just wanted to show the breadth of our solution.
rep,big basket dot com retailer in apac.
rep,with them the challenge was they had a lot of repeat all the options for chicken shows me the delivery options gives me the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from search box shows me a banner some of the commonly searched terms popular brands popular categories not just that you took it to the next level by my adding personalization to it meaning if i was buying chicken without skin more often i would see chicken without skin on top but say if you were buying chicken with skin more often your see chicken with skin on top. so in all of these cases you'll see all these customers are from different vertical they have different set of audience and the way they sell is different. and everyone had a unique challenge for their autosuggest or with with a search right the initiation of the search experience by the customer we came in we understood that and then tried to implement a solution that was more suitable for their site their vertical and specific to their challenges. let me let me show you another example these are more on the ui before i get on to the the technology piece another one could be multiple categories right. so if i was to search for mobile right now on an electronic site if i was going to for mobile my intent is yet not clear am i looking for mobile phone mobile headphones mobile cases or covers but we have built a technology that that can identify the categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity not just that we immediately start showing results for mobile because that is the most important or most popular category and or a period of time say if people were clicking more often than on mobile cases and then on mobile headsphones the mobile cases would come on position two and mobile headphones would come on position three.
rep,if we built for outnet who sells design in a parallel i fell i just llok for alexander wang was also a designer and sells a lot of different products say a bag sport bag shoulder bags or dresses shoes um you see all of these products by alexander vang neatly bucketed into each category giving the customer the ability to browse through these products horizontally or vertically on a single page. another example is say i like the shoes which could be and there could be a hundred reasons why i like the shoes it would be the color the style the designer the price point customer can come in and click on see similar products that opens up a modal window the customer can choose from any of the similar products if they like if they don't like they can close this model and go back to the search result page.
prospect,how do you define similar products.
rep,this is again something which is based on machine learning right so the the technology is able to find similar products based on the product catalog attributes right and the customers intent also right so it is is it is he on this page because he's more bent towards the color towards the the style or to towards the say designer based on that the technology will be able to understand and start showing similar products. but to ant two elements to it one is the product catalog which will give all the product catalog of the existing product and the other products that you carry and be the user behavior in terms of what the user has been looking at on the site. because say someone looking at $30 product you don't want to show him $100 product right so that is also taken into consideration with regards to say pricing even if it is similar there are other for sandals and shoes which are in that price which show ones in the same price range first rather than showing something which is either too expensive or very low priced.
rep,do that not does that even on price say you can you can again define that i 1 plus or minus 20% or plus or my plus or minus 50%.
rep,let me get on to technologies right these were few of the ui elements very specific to customers and we can design these based on your need and not required but the core technology so the before unbxd started both the founders actually spent quite some time goodwin here are doing research on two things one they they crawl through various different catalogs available out there on the web look at how these catalogs are configured and how these product catelogue attributes were defined b there is a lot of research in terms of how people search today online be it on an e-commerce site or even on google or yahoo and we define the the search queries into twelve different types . and these are the only twelve different types of queries that can occur on an e-commerce site an exact search of feature search of say a black dress where black is a feature of the product dress thematic search could be party tops where party is a theme of the product top. natural language query wherein people you say under or for in and in the query itself then say a slang or abbreviation search but in mtb for mountain bikes or i'm looking for a 55 inch tv and instead of inch i put double quotes out there right so those becomes more of more of abbreviations on our cilantro and. it's important that the search system is able to understand all these different search query types the the customers have this behavior because google today understands all of this and they expect the e-commerce site also to understand things with us we have built a technology that is able to understand 85 to 90 percent of your search queries irrespective of what kind they are here
rep,here is what typically sites see in terms of the query types from a home furnishing site the product type still remains on top and then comes the feature type search and then. so how do we map the search queries right say someone looking for a nike black field boots right typically traditionally all the search systems the way they would work is they would start to go and find nike black field and boots all four words in your product catalog tightly or the other attributes which could be description all that is thing that's the attribute set the product that's right in that case what happens is they then they start doing or-ing or anding meaning everywhere they find these words they start showing all of those results or they they limited by ending it nike and black and field and boots right. those are the traditional way of doing  search  this kind of limits the results or shows a lot of irrelevant results but with us what we've built is a contextual aware system which is able to understand that within the query field boots is more of a product type i would say tom right black is is the color attribute and nike is the brand attribute and based on that we start showing the results accordingly not just that so you have 100 black boots or say nike black boots i know based on the user behavior we also start changing the order of these products based on the popularity right what is it that people are clicking more and buying more often those kind of products start coming on top of the fold in real time by and then this is done by the user per click right analytics is being gathered and being processed in the immediate next action by the same user or any other user any any questions.
rep,yeah then we optimize this or say constantly optimize this search by doing two things one looking at your website performance began to user behavior on your website the words on your website the phrases or your catalogue right and then your overall environment but the second thing is the defect right we crawl the web to understand how people are searching how these natural languages are coming into picture what are the festivities we start taking those <> as well into the overall solution which is then used for all our customers obviously something that has been captured by the web. whereas the intelligence from your website is something that is unique to you we merge code and then start feeding that into our engine for for it tolerance system ability to have multi words filter so the algorithm is able to correct a search query of up to six words but two alphabets misspelled in each word does the strength of the algorithm and we can auto correct 85-90% of your misspelled queries without you having to create any libraries at the backend. so how do you solve solve this today any of your misspelled queries this is something that's been taken care of by the default netsuite or do you go and generate reports and start creating libraries at the backend.
prospect,there's kind of like a fuzzy fuzzy logic kind of thing built in so if i misspelled black still shows me.
rep,got him.
prospect,a bunch of black products.
rep,right got it okay but i think that fails on multi word spell check it's multi word queries when i misspelled a single word at times it does work but the moment is a multi-word right two words or three words off it just one word is misspelled this kind of fails right there.
prospect,yeah i mean we're not doing too hot right now both words are spelled correctly if there's.
rep,no but yeah with us this is automatically taken care of multiple spellcheck don't have to do anything on it we do provide an automated stemming say bench benches as an example that i showed last glass glasses other stemmed word could be knife knives game gaming center central system is able to understand all of these and start showing the results differentiator that we bring to the table is also filters so it's it's important again to show the right set of filters when the customers are looking at say hundred products or 200 products as as an end result of the search screen for them to narrow down to the right set of products based on their priorities. now here with filters the way we approach it is say for shoes as a category you would want particular set of filters size ankle height width casual shoe type. now with us irrespective of how the customer search is speed shoes casual shoes for my shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes and they might come in and say men's adidas as far as 75% or more results are from a category shoes the shoes filters would automatically kick in right that's taken care of. now we take it to the next level by making them more dynamic meaning say over a period of time people were clicking customers working more on width as a filter then size then width filter would come on top and size would would come down. variances i i started to carry a few products in variances if i'm not wrong but then the the onus on the customer to find the right variance image so say here for an example red dress start showing you all of the dresses which are red but still showing the primary images which are black blue gray giving me the first feel that these are these are not the red dresses available but this is the eighth one this is the only dress that's that's available in red.
rep,and then putting the onus on the customer to click on the right color swatch and then start seeing seeing the red color images of these products we have built a technology that is able to automatically start showing me the variants images given you have the variants image indexed in your feed we pick up the variants image and start showing those for a search result page. and then we take it to the next next level to our color synonyms. so say i come onto your side and i look for a chocolate sofa just because that's the color i have in mind the system is able to understand that that the chocolate it comes from the brown color family if you have a chocolate sofa we obviously start showing that but if you do not have that we understand that say brown or tan coffee much more closer colors to chocolate and not the reds are the whites of the other blacks right. so we immediately pick up some of the other colored products in the in the proximity and from the same color family and start showing those. zero is a stage all sites are going to have zeros on stage and the reasons could be you don't carry a product you don't carry a brand or say the search query itself is so butchered that it's difficult for the search system to understand in that case we believe that it is important to start guiding the customer right the onus is on us to start guiding the customers rather than expecting them to go back to your search page or to your navigation.
rep,we do this in real time highly personalized for each user by placing these two widgets one recently viewed some of the products that they have looked at on your site for the time spend we start showing those those products so that they this way they have the ability to go back in the proud discovery journey now based on their affinity towards the color towards the brand towards style price point we start recommending some of the products in real time something that they would be more probable to buy and this helps them to move ahead in their journey over all any any questions before i move on to the merchandising controls.
prospect,other recommendations based on like things that are similar to things that they've looked at our bar or these are just popular items or.
rep,no this this one this one is more dependent on what they've looked at.
prospect,well i mean obviously recently viewed is but the recommends is is like popular products that are based on what they've looked at.
rep,yes popular producs i wouldn't say popular products the products in proximity to what they have looked at when they've spent most time on right. and so that like the data points that are in use they're like the product categories that they're in. and so that's the tuning that we do based on your catalog right so say for your catalog might be important or not important right so that's a tuning we do during that the implementation phase. it's color an important element or not if category subcategory element important or not is that the designer which is important or the brand is that important. so we identify the important elements of your search and how important each of these elements is and we give weightage to them accordingly. so it's tuned per customer and based on their business nee.
rep,so this is the technology that makes the experience to 90% right and the remaining 10% control is something that you would want to give your merchants by giving them the ability to run brand promotions or seasonal promotions ability to promote any of the new arrivals products take care of the inventory right based on an inventory you might want to promote or demote a particular set of products or categories and then promotions based on margins so various different elements right and i'll walk you through a couple of live examples.
prospect,well on the previous slide there so that applies to search results or.
rep,search results.
prospect,okay but not like category sorting or deep cover category sorting at all. okay.
rep,not yet so for category or navigation we are launching a product early twenties which will be surely and out of the world product as well the idea is that you start showing different navigation menu different category pages for all your customers if you have 100000 visitors all of them should be seeing the navigation menu and category pages in 100000 ways. so that's the kind of part that we have built is in beta and we'll be out may be say early next year . but so these these controls are these are the elements that you can control through running various different rules could be redirects boosting slotting pinning banners let me actually show you some of the examples and before i go there that i want to also talk about this the automatic read category pages versus search pages right .
rep,so the with us you do not have to create any any redirects right the system is able to understand the big categories right so say you have a category sneakers now someone comes onto the side and looks first me even if they were click a sneaker and the system is able to understand that and then and redirects the customers automatically to the sneakers page for the most obvious ones but for say something out apart from sneakers or sandals if you want someone looking for sandals to be redirected to the sneakers page that is something you can do from our back-end dashboard let me let me actually quickly take you to the dashboard here. did you see the unbxd merchandising dashboeard screen.
prospect,oh yeah .
rep,okay ask so this is the dashboard that we built for a demo site here now once we are done with the implementation you will have access to this dashboard here you will have a high-level understanding in terms of how many products you have as a feed size like you can control multiple sites multiple domains could be live site and staging or testing sites as well um that you can manage from a single domain or single login these are the fields the product catalog attributes that we make searchable non searchable based on based on your business.
prospect,one sec go back on the quick and further tell me about the feed what is that.
rep,yeah . the feed.
rep,the feed.
rep,yeah so if you would want start taking
rep,what is what is in the feed is that is that the data that powers your search engine. yes so what we would need from you right to power the search engine is primarily a product catalog feed.
rep,right so we'll take that from next week we are are you can you can pass it on in the form of an excel json xml common it is ftp location we can pick it up from there and then start using that to power the search. here are the fields from your feed that we would have got these are your product catalog attributes will make them searchable non searchable based on your business will control this but you will have complete visibility into this.
prospect,okay. okay.
rep,here are the fields from your feed that we would have got these are your product catalog attributes will make them searchable non searchable based on your business will control this but you will have complete visibility into this. then filters or facets these are global filters and facets and i will show you how you can set them up for a particular set of categories but this these are your totally or global facets across the site you can quickly come in here and say price select an option the price actually create facet. ability to create synonyms again to reiterate you don't have to create synonyms for stemmed words for misspelled words or even english dictionary synonymous words this is only for industry jargons to give you an example for one of our customers and that says to the industry it wouldn't make sense for us to add that in thought universal corpus because lifters might mean something else in a different industry altogether so instead we give you the control to create these synonyms very easily so say lifters is equal to synonyms oh sorry my bad shoes create synonym which is a bidirectional it can also be a unidirectional synonym so lifters is equal to shoes and you're done. let me show you merchandising how you
rep,can merchandise or create rules this is where you can create global rules say all this promote home brand always demote out of inventory products are your inventory products those are the kind of rules any rule that is applicable to all your search queries can be set here let me take a example we see the black dress the first black dress the two blue dresses in the striped dress on the life site today when we search for dress and i come back here on the merchandising dashboard you see the replica of your site black dress the two blue dresses and they and the stripe dress right the same thing that we are seeing on the site. the same office site these this is the 90% experience that i spoke about all our dresses these are not shoes or jackets and they are relevant and they are also based on the popularity based on the user behavior based on the relevancy of the of the query but your merchants might want to come in and control this by running various different rules. they can now start coming come in and say start filtering these results based on any of the elements by brand by category you are buys a color or say run promotions boost sought slot. let me show you an example i want to boost a particular brand all this for this particular query. so brand contains eliza you see all the eliza products on top now right even within this you this dress is the latest survival on the catalog i want this on position one this dress is going out of season i want this in position two so that i can get rid of the inventory drag and drop now. every time someone looks for a dress as a query these two products will always be on top this was a product level placement let me show you how you can do a product catalog attribute level placement so say slotting position five to six i always want dresses from a particular brand which could be ralph now the fifth and the six products are the most popular ralph lauren dresses even if this just goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next popular ralph lauren dress.
rep,and also you can add banners with this search results page by inserting an image url landing page url or an html right so every time someone does a search for dress is all actually the site dress i these are the two dresses that we had pinned the other two of current dresses right all of these changes are currently in time and. now let me show you one more thing with merchandising which is i ability you create landing pages say clearance clearance 2016 there is nothing on the site so i don't see anything on the site i can come back here clearance 2016 create rule merchandise again i don't have anything on the catalog right now under clearance so doesn't show up and come down to landing page click okay now you have the complete catalog available for you to curate for this particular landing page say bran contains eliza similarly you can now again start running promotions or say pinning products drag and drop you can add banners to this particular page. now if i was to go back onto the site it clearance 2016 the same results that we were seeing on on the dashboard we can now take this url and start using it for any of our marketing campaigns email marketing campaigns seo campaigns or say google adwords for that any any questions on this. one more thing on merchandising.
prospect,well one quick question so in the query rules there so if your query that you set there is dress it's already gonna take care of like dresses and. its mocks and you know whatever kind of similar searches so that's gonna that's gonna come out.
rep,yes. that is all taken care of you don't have to this is only if you want to take it to the next level right there is some business rule that you want to run on top of it that is when you want to come here and then and make the change.
rep,so you don't have to do this for all your queries you might want to look at it just for a popular queries for two kinds of queries the most performing queries and the least performing queries right if a query is not performing well showed you the filters and how dynamic these filters are right so this is where you can also set some of these filter rules so say for category sneakers i want a particular set of filters or say at least first banners let me show you that you can insert banners say for sneakers here and then here you can set facets or filters so these are the facets and filters now i want the size filter on top i can drag and drop on the first position and the brand brand filter on position two drag and drop i want to hide the tax filter i can come and say hide the tax filter hide the the test filter those are gone right so now irrespective of how someone searches for sneakers right sneakers men's sneakers sneakers nike sneakers adidas sneakers as far as 75% of more results are from sneakers as a category this these filters will automatically kick in in this order with the banner that you would have set for sneakers.
rep,and then the next thing is the reporting right so primarily we provide three levels of reporting one is the high level executive reporting or the executive overview and this is not dependent in terms of say you can you can look at only 250 queries or 250 products but this is more about the time right you can look at your last one week data one one data one year data based based on what you are trying to analyze this report gives you a high level understanding of your overall search performance with regards to top search queries top products added to card top zero result queries and top click products then the next level is the queries report this will give you all your queries for a defined period of time and each queries performance with regards to the hits products through feeds click through ctrs carts orders now if i was to click on dresses as a query it also shows me a trendline of performance or sales for this particular query. now this is say we are here the merchants start seeing a in performance for dresses query then now they know that they need to go back to the merchandising dashboard and maybe try some of the business rules of business logic to start seeing a positive impact i start the improvement on the on the query performance. similarly products here yoi'll get each and every products overview in terms of what the views and add to carts are when i click on the products gives me a trend line the sales trend line for the particular product . and the queries
rep,associated with each of with this particular product and how this product is performing across each of these queries. so that's the solution michael just curious like it not like it something that you see would add value a twist area.
prospect,it sounds great i just i want to find out some more about how exactly it integrates with our current website platform.
rep,sure i can quickly walk you through one of the example i'm just making sure i cover all of this so this is also the mobile piece right some of the elements on mobile very specific to mobile the fragile body the so on error tolerance right what you have also built is like i know you have fuzzy logic but then see a say on mobile what is also important is the key proximity errors i people typing o or interchanging the alphabets right the algorithm is also able to understand that ability to have multi select filters on a small mobile screen. even the enterprises have not been able to build something like this but we give this by default on mobile. then scope suggestions and recent searches which are highly personalized for each user on mobile here are a few ui element to kind of quickly show the alternative products a i like this product more like this i click click on that opens up a modal window here with some of the similar products i like the products i click on it i don't i close the motive and then go back onto the search results page. and then category refinement similar to mobile experience that i showed you in the for desktop say someone looking for shoes then within shoes could be men women boys and they can refine into each of these categories to see a limited set of results on the site. now with regards to the implementation question that you have let me show you an example souspatriot tacticle here so we don't go with a sub-domain approach right if i was to do a search for nike on uspatriot tacticle you see the domain doesn't change right the customer still owns the domain it is the same domain hosted by the customer.
rep,but first surfaces page what starts happening is you start serving or rendering just the header and the footer and give us an empty div tag wherein we start rendering the results through html in real time right these are all ajax-based results. so this is this section of the site right starting from search from here till here is something which is rendered by the cus by unbxd there is the header and the footer is something that's rendered by the customer. and all of this happens within 500 milliseconds and 90% of our queries respond within i would say 200 milliseconds and then anything below 500 milliseconds is actually not even visible to human eye as per rule. so our sla are very strong out.
prospect,so what about the templating or is it like something that we would have access to make changes to do.
rep,i would want to understand more so obviously the auto suggest is not right so if i'm talking about this right there's something this is not but if you want to make changes yes we can always help you. so say we come in me implement something and then you are not seeing enough good results than you we would want to come in and make those changes for you so you would surely help you with that and any other minor design changes that you are going through is something that's taken care of as a part of support but if there is a totally redesigning of the site that you're going through in that case that would come at an additional cost but it should be very nominal.
prospect,so let's say let's say i wanted to like take the outlines off around the boxes and change the button colors and fonts like so i wouldn't be able to go in and modify some template file or style sheet somewhere to do that or i would have to engage with you guys.
rep,you will have doing it with us.
rep,and our supporting team will be able to do that.
rep,so that's <> i think that the nets with segmentation api is not something that's that's preferred otherwise for other platforms we do an api integration wherein you have complete control on the back end.
prospect,oh sorry pardon me one more time.
rep,in the back end api integration right that gives you more control on some of these elements changing at url is also something that's possible but netsuite has its own limitation of doing an api implementation. right so that limits us but on some of the other platforms we still do an api implementation which gives the customer the complete control of making any of these changes.
prospect,so in in in that type of situation on some some platforms are saying that the back-end can bring the data in and into the pre-existing front-end templates that we have but we can't do that and that's we.
rep,no.
prospect,okay that's fine.
prospect,so with so let's say on a search result page like this and you know we're showing products obviously but let's say there's some non product content that we want to show in the same product grid of search results so like on the 3rd and the 7th and the 15th grid slide we want to show you know non product content but similarly formatted but i.
rep,yeah so i think i had this point in my mind last time but i forgot to show you this i remember that you have a lot of content on the site right.
prospect,well i mean there's it's on a separate site right now and i mean the the blog stuff is and then the but there's there's like kind of like you know we want to like.
rep,so yes we have the ability to make content searches yes it is again considered as a sku and we can obviously define that now here is an example if you're still seeing my screen tell you about their business the way they started their business was they have a huge library of articles on various different crystals right so people search about these crystals on google and land up on their site mostly reading about them reading those articles so they have a huge library of these articles for these crystals and they wanted to make sure that that is also made searchable but still giving more priority to the products because products is what fetches then the the revenue at the end of the day. so here you see this example amethyst right these are all products these are all products but then here's something somewhere here yeah amethyst meaning and users this is not a product now if i was to click on amethyst meaning and uses these are all articles on top guides and resources and then these are the products. so we made the content also searchable for them so if you have content that you want to make searchable and want to make it an integral part of the of the oral search results we can do that and it could also be tuned with regards to how you are positioning it at what positions you want to put that content.
prospect,okay so you treat content pages as product pages basically flexibility.
prospect,okay that's cool all right they've got kind of their own data points as well okay.
rep,we can look at those and we can see how you want to make it searchable is it more on the description more than the titles of those of those pages right so that is something that . and our implementation is the quickest in the industry takes i would say six to eight weeks typically six weeks is more than enough for a suitable site live but we keep a buffer of of two weeks at least if there is any delay in terms of say back and forth in terms of designing or say even qa right ah doing pesticide and gives it to your team for testing you find a bug we fix it for you. so based on that it could be up to eight weeks but you say within six weeks we can take a site live. all our infrastructure is on amazon making sure we have high availability of the systems we penalize ourselves for any downtime even for a 15 minutes downtime on the site we are ready to be penalized up to 15% of the monthly fee so that's the kind of confidence that we have and all our customers get a premium support which is 24/7 you can you will have a dedicated account manager that you can speak with and then contact them through email to chat through say phone and last but not least it's a completely roi based model i can put in some numbers to show you what is the kind of roi or what is the kind of revenue that we can influence for vestavia right before you even be implemented we also guarantee it to some extent depending on the scale depending on on what your site performance is if we take the statistics and then guarantee what you can see in 60 90 days of running the poc with us .
prospect,ok so let's say let's say our revenues a million dollars a month okay so you guarantee an increase of 10% is that correct.
rep,yes anywhere between 7 to 10% i would say at times it could be higher also so we have to really look at few of the data points on your site a what are your total sessions on the site for i assert sessions on the site what is a conversion rate today right and what's your product catalog size what's your conversion rate with search without search so those are the data points that we see and then we can guarantee anywhere between 7 to 10% that's the contractual guarantee but all our customers are seeing anywhere about 20 25 % right one of the slide that i showed you in the beginning is like 60% also right but we are the only one who can actually give you some sort of contractual guarantee number what is increasing.
prospect,so so let's say that you you increase our revenue 10% so then what is the cost of that on a.
rep,it's still not pricing on that you wouldn't you would still not be by new in terms of how much of the revenue that we are influencing we are not attached to the revenue we are still being our prizes still on these search sessions how many search sessions do you see on the site so do you have any statistics around what are the total sessions on the site what is the traffic that you've seen and how much of it is search sessions.
prospect,like a month like the last month or you want average over the year or what.
rep,average over the year or last three months anything is fine i were going to avoid the peaks and troughs right so kind of get an estimate of what your averages are which could be over three month six months or a year.
prospect,yeah so sessions so if you're you want to sahre with sessions.
rep,let me take a note of this yeah go ahead what are the sessions.
prospect,about 3 million sessions over the past year.
rep,3 million or okay do you have the search sessions .
prospect,10% of that .
rep,300k and .
prospect,that's across maybe closer to 11% .
rep,25000 are on the high side maybe say 30000 so sessions just giving and you said you have what like thousand products listen 2000 products announces right.
prospect,yeah i mean that was a ballpark figure i don't have an
rep,exact count but roughly that okay so our pricing would be somewhere i would say for say 30000 right let let us consider to be some room for growth in terms of your sessions right this would this would fall in the price range of around i would say thirty thousand sessions will be do i just want to make sure that i give you a number would be around say 1750 seventeen hundred and fifty dollars a month.
rep,and then that would be an your initial commitment to us would be 90 to meaning we take the site live 30 days of life site you think like the end results you didn't like the conversion rates are say even you didn't like working with the ops team you didn't like me as a sales class you can you can walk out of the contract with no questions asked. post 90 to 120 days is when you can decide whether you want to continue with unbxd or not and at that point in time you will have a 1 year long commits at least that you make with us.
prospect,okay and so that's the like what did you call it bl c phase.
rep,poc proof of concept.
prospect,gotcha and then so then then it's like a one-year term.
rep,yeah post that it's a one year.
prospect,after poc.
rep,after after you're satisfied that's the whole point so you're not even satisfied at the 20th day you're not satisfied with what you are seeing right and we can come in and say seven percent ten percent right but saying you have twenty percent in your mind right and if you're not happy during the poc phase we've delivered ten percent you wanted twenty percent and you're not seeing it you can still walk out.
prospect,so just kind of some back of the envelope stuff here okay so if we say all right so if we say 10% increase.
rep,its gonna share some other numbers maybe i can i can quickly do an roi sheet as well so you put those numbers.
prospect,so let's say we've got about twelve hundred conversions with search that's a little over that on average.
rep,okay let me just
rep,put these my most one second say you said i don't say 25 thousands of sessions right and what is your do you have the percentage of the search conversions.
prospect,443.
rep,the search conversion rate is four point four three so comes to 1100 is what i get and what's the average order value like
rep,the search three one eight yes i will see my screen the excel and i just put up this so say you have 25000 such sessions today it and at 4 point 40 the conversions you're looking at 1100 orders at 318 dollars this is the revenue that you are making correct even at a bare minimum of 5% increase you are getting additional seventeen thousand dollars in revenue by paying just seventeen hundred and fifty dollars to unbxd which is good 90s roi but if you were to be able to give you 10% right you are making 19 x roi and this is the revenue probably not realized without a good search functionality right so we are adding more revenue at a 5% would be 17 thousand at seven point five or ten percent to twenty six thousand are thirty-five thousand dollars on a monthly basis.
prospect,okay so my site visits sessions so saying 3:30 so yeah that's i mean conservative monthly positions with
prospect,search the current conversion rate average over the year let's say so that's calculate enough that and okay yeah can you send me this spreadsheet
rep,this one i can okay i can do that i can send it especially the deck that i presented to you now and the another doc's mean that i would want to actually share with you is more about the the the implementation we should also give you an high level understanding in terms of the implementation so this is the document if i still see my screen right there three is to to search implementation hosted such we still do this hosted such but we do not recommend this right most of the traditional search vendors do or hosted and hence we have this here but this negatively impacts your search the only reason people do this is when they don't have enough it resources internally or say companies don't want to look into it right so come please come in and say you picture. but then the most recommended is ajax even some of the larger customers like express are still on ajax they have yet not gone on to a a api implementation so most of our customers are currently on an ajax implementation another third way is the restful api that we can do so this has a kind of high-level overview in terms of how we can do the the implementation for each of these okay i'll also share doc.
prospect,is there any implementation cost or is it just a monthly cost.
rep,well the way we work is the daily sign of the contract or kickoff the project right even if you sign today and we kick off the project on the 1st of november see the billing starts on 1st of november we start the implementation the implementation typically is 6 to 8 weeks right so though you are still paying for the six to eight weeks on a monthly basis and that kind of takes care of your implementation in cost the 1750s i mean is this kind of for the first month in the second month which includes the implementation cleaning of the system taking the sight live from the the moment we go live right we do not take care of your we do not count your search traffic on so but you will still continue to pay 1750 we will not look at your search queries or search sessions how many are getting even if you get say in instead of 25000 for that particular month even if you've got 50000 sessions you're not being billed for it right. the post 90 to 120 days which is something you control all right you can come back and say 19 years or say 120 days of us having kick get started the project if you are happy then we get into the one-year contract if you are not you can walk out or if you want to extend it by another one month you can also choose to do that so then we kind of their kind of flexible. but to answer your first question the implementation cost the six to eight weeks you pay the monthly fee that kind of takes care of the implementation.
rep,of the work is on our side the 10% of the
rep,of the work is on our side the 10% of the working on your side the designing is done by us the coding is done by us all we need is your netsuite access and the feed right in terms of where we can pick up the feed feed from and then then and lastly we will need your inputs on the design elements and when we are ready to go live we would want to involve your team to do testing that is after we have done the testing obviously you would also want to come and test it if there are any bugs you see you come back to us we fix them for you and then and then we take the side live.
prospect,okay sounds good so yeah just some of the data points that you got on there i think that's good and we'll talk to it about my cf talked to my cfo about it and try to see if we can get funding improved i think that shouldn't be much of a challenge.
prospect,just just informal and emails good.
rep,monday or tuesday.
prospect,maybe thursday morning.
rep,thursday morning next week thursday morning central time i'll put a ten minutes placeholder on your calendar so even if even if you get busy just feel free to respond and we can we can move it based on your schedule but i for any any questions that come up feel free to shoot me an email or call me back i will include my number on the on the email and i'll be more than happy to answer .
prospect,okay sounds.
rep,great great michael thank you thanks for your time today on the call and look forward to working with you soon.
prospect,all right
prospect,i'm at california at our headquarters.
rep,oh awesome great so we are headquartered in sunnyvale with offices in chicago and back in india and to introduced myself though i'm ashish i'm part of the sales team primarily manage our smb and in some of our enterprise customers. and i know you were you were speaking with abhishek one of my colleague and wanted to explore the unbxd site search solution.
rep,so thank you for giving us a time today but before i get started i just wanted to understand a little more about your business why customers buy from you and if there are any specific challenges around site search that you're trying to solve today.
prospect,what was our yeah we certainly have challenges with our current website but there's not many changes we want to make to that site cuz we are hoping this year we can upgrade and move to another platform. we are going to be coming off emerson's platform and moving to an easier more up-to-date current platform that will give us full search capabilities and i don't you know we have like i said we have the ar right now. submitting within our organization and we hope to probably be starting that process within the next couple months i'd say probably at the first of year after january. we will be looking into moving into the new platform so i mean really this call is for you to kind of tell me what you were interested in because you kind of got to us around the hard way.
prospect,you emailed the president of insinkerator who emailed our president who then pass it on to val which is our vp of digital and she asked me just to look into what you had done or what analysis you had done of our website.
rep,sure sure i'll walk you through few of those elements today i think you have requested a report a user a user report as well and i'll forward that to you after this call too.
rep,but yeah so that that's a quick good overview for us i was to two questions so today you said you are on emerson platform is that a in-house custom e-commerce platform that you're using today.
prospect,is through sharepoint in websphere so all of our store and product pages are through websphere so and then the other pages are built in sharepoint.
rep,okay got it i now remember talking to emerson a few years ago i was talking to one of one of the the the i think if i'm not wrong when i was selling the sharepoint replication technology through <synergy> which is now metalogix  and that's when i had i had and then some small business <> it's good to talk to emerson team again.
rep,also curious have you plan on what platform you would be moving to in in future have you decided on that or is still in the evaluation phase.
prospect,no not no we we are not i'm not sure yeah i mean we're looking at a couple different platforms so we're kind of valuating both of them right now which one would be best and then of course that will be working with a third party to do that for us to host it. in addition to probably building the site i mean will be responsible for a lot of the development ourselves but because we have a web team in manila that helps support us that's on our team but we have not made that final decision yet.
rep,would you be comfortable sharing i mean assuming you're in final stages what are the top two candidates you're looking at only if you are comfortable talking about them because<>.
prospect,i don't know that val has been working on that i don't know that she has not shared that with me yeah so that's not a question i can answer for you right now.
rep,okay so we'll jump through our slides or i'll just leave you with this one last thought our sees a sas offering it connects with multiple different back-end systems so irrespective of what you choose we can integrate with the api and there is no additional cost for you to migrate from one platform to another platform. or even if you want to shut it shut us down and one year from now that's completely okay because this is a sas base offering and you can turn off the tap anytime you want so all those options belong to you and you could enjoy the service if you upgrade and you can shut down the service after you upgrade if you need if you think you come to that conclusion <>.
prospect,so what your company help me understand what your company does that's what i i guess that's the whole this is kind of a seek searching call i guess val just wanted me to understand exactly what you were trying to communicate in the email and i mean at this point like i said we're getting ready to move over. so we're not looking at buying any services or adding any current technology to or any new technology to our current website so again i guess can you i guess with your slides we'll learn a little bit more about what you do and what you offer.
rep,sure absolutely sure and i'll walk you through this right so on high-level four things that we will discuss today to set the agenda right. i'll talk a little about who we are what kind of site search problems that we solve today what are the approaches right i've done a quick study on your site and to show what the areas of opportunities are and i'll walk you through those. and lastly we can discuss any other details if this is a solution that you feel would be right for closetmaid we can discuss the next steps performance sla is roi implementation and any q and a's you have but even during the presentation if you have any questions please feel free to stop me at any one point of time you know i will be more than happy to answer those questions.
rep,i like to spend a few minutes talking about us we are a five and a half year old company headquartered in sunnyvale with offices in chicago and in india we have 1200 plus sites hosted globally with us 120 plus customers brands right here in the us.
rep,from fashion we work with some of the giants like express rue21 from hardware b2b maybe something that could be of interest ib supply parts warehouse us auto parts is the largest auto parts online retailer in the us hh gregg from electronics fresh direct ashley furniture store the largest online furniture stores in the us is one of a prestigious customer.
rep,from platforms perspective as navin just mentioned we are a platform agnostic solution so irrespective of what ecommerce platform you're on be it ibm websphere today or be it you know any other e-commerce platform in future we have the capability to integrate seamlessly into any e-commerce platform.
prospect,so your company does not actually do website development or platforms here you have technology that you can integrate with new platforms.
rep,yes and the technology is all about search or product discovery right how do you make products easily discoverable for your prospects coming on the site right and i'll show you few examples of that.
prospect,i know it's not easy on our current site so i have trouble sometimes finding products.
rep,okay so we make those easily discoverable right making sure the customer finds the right product gets to the right product really quick and then help you obviously increase conversion we actually guarantee a minimum of 10% increase in conversions for our for our customers. and and our customers actually see 20 to 40 percent increase in conversion in 90 to 120 days of going live right but that's that's the i would say that's the goal of an engagement with any of our customers. so i've i've done a brief study on your site and let me take you through a few examples i'm sure you must be aware of these and i'll not spend much time i'll just rush through these but this is important for us to kind of quickly create a baseline in terms of where we can come in and make a difference so i hope that's okay.
prospect,yeah that's fine.
rep,cool so monal the first thing that i looked at on your site was the autosuggest that's the first interaction that the customer makes on the sites right when they start typing in few alphabets in the search bar. it's important to start exposing them to the right products to the right categories to the the most popular products or say the search words right the the root words for them to start exploring the products immediately and not wait for them to complete the phrase hit enter and look for a search assistance. and i see there is an absence of this there is this element the most important element of search is not available on the site and i'll show you a few of the examples in terms of how we approach this. post autosuggest i looked at relevancy and i looked at few tried to look for few products on the site and see how relevant the results were right i look for a white cube organizer you do have quite a few cubic organizers and some of them are also available in white but when i search for it i get a zero result page.
rep,then i look for cube organizers just cube without the white made the query more broad but again i ended up getting into a zero result page look for fabric bins just two results i think the second one is probably not even relevant though you have a lot of fabric bins on the site today. looked for closet rods a very specific product that you have but again as zero result search looked for cabinets abroad again zero result page laminate cabinets a zero result page. then i look for stemmed words right cart versus carts both mean the same right the intent of the customer does not change here when i look for cart i i do get the results but when i look for carts which is plural i get a zero results page right. cubicals because i try to misspell it i use <>.
prospect,you can't do that i can't misspell and i understand and i don't mean to stop you i'm certainly not trying to be rude but we're well aware that this is issue on our site it's just when you go to our product pages it looks for you have to type in exactly what is in the title. which we know the average consumer is not going to know that a fabric door bababa is you know what they're looking for so it's like for instance if you type in fabric door you do get a lot of results you get up to five pages because that's their not fabric then some of them are clogged in some chemical drawers. it gets a little confusing but that's when you actually get a fabric drawer pulled up and like i said it's we're a well aware that this is not our site it's not a good place to search a product now you can luckily you can do by product number and it will come straight up so that's nice. if someone person buys a product and they've lost their instruction sheet and they go type in 2875 because that's a wire kit they bought then they can download the instructions but most people that first come to our site that's why we kind of redesign our homepage which we just recently did in the past 90 days.
prospect,and you can see that we made it easier we kind of brought the product pages the shopping straight to the front page so people could actually immediately get where they're going or where they're looking at some of our best sellers our new products and etc but we're well aware how broken our search engine is and that's one of the reasons why we want to move to another you know another system and another platform.
rep,okay yeah so.
prospect,it's a it's an old it's no way to build websites and it's emerson's platform i mean emerson doesn't even use sharepoint anymore so they've moved on with their new site and we must move on so.
rep,okay monal would you know what emerson uses for search.
prospect,i do not i'm not responsible for emerson we're just owned by emerson and emerson is gonna be selling us soon so i have no idea.
rep,okay okay and then you mentioned you will be moving to something else in next few months or few quarters and i am assuming that means you'll move into a new e-commerce platform is that correct or something <>.
prospect,yeah that is correct.
rep,okay so we will skip rest of our study experience we worked with multiple back and platforms and what she will tell you in next few minutes applies irrespective of whose platform you use and we work on top of atg oracle ibm sap magento our technology works across all of those platforms on top of all of them so what we are going to tell you about how our search works is across all of those platforms so irrespective of who you choose coming months.
prospect,i'm sorry you cut out their first <>.
rep,i was just saying that irrespective of whose platform you choose our search engine will work across all of those platforms and you will see similar benefits across all the platforms.
rep,ashish keep going. sure thank you navin for pitching in so monal a quick slide that i wanted to show quick statistics around search the red flag is 80 percent of your visitors will actually will leave the site if they are not able to find the right product and that's where we come in to the picture.
rep,and you see express ceo actually mention us in his q2 earnings call after after we implemented and showed them a drastic increase in the conversion right but on high-level why unbxd or why would why would closet mate choose to work with us.
rep,five things business technology merchandising controls mobile performance right from from a business perspective we understand your business why customers buy from you and we try and implement few of those elements few of those your business usps into the overall product discovery experience on the site. and and this is highly customized for each customers and i will show you few examples. technology right you would want to create a repeatable experience for your shoppers right and and we provide this by by making the technology contextual aware and through our machine learning and personalization we understand the intent of the customer right.
rep,third is the merchandising control so curious do you have merchandisers today do you have a merchandising team.
prospect,a merchandising team.
prospect,no i mean i have we have a product management team but the digital i mean you're talking to the two people who are solely responsible for closetmaid dot com <nedra mazzone>.
rep,okay got it cool so we do have a merchandising dashboard and i can show you that on today's call all on our follow up call but that makes you know everyone's life easy in terms of how you place products how you run promotions how you can promote or demote products pinning slotting sorting right and i will walk you through this. and which is a clutter free ui very easy to use to mobile in terms of mobile responsive all the features are mobile responsive be it a responsive site or an adaptive site and they will all work seamlessly on a mobile screen or on a tablet.
rep,so do you have a separate mobile screen or your current website are is it is the current website i mean is that responsive or is it adaptive.
prospect,<it sounds like our web pop> site is not responsive but it will be moving forward because when we make an update to the website on our current site then we have to do the same we have yeah we have to do the same on our mobile site.
rep,sure sounds good and with regards to performance right we promise an roi on every dollar spent with us we provide higher sillies for conversions for up times for response times and which are contractual slas right. we actually put them in the contract so that's what makes us stand up up right from roi perspective we make sure that you get at least 10x off whatever you spend with us and minimum of 10 percent increase in conversions on the site. here are some statistics in terms of performance improvement on our customer sites furniture and home decor you'll notice 60% increase in conversion rate and 30% increase in revenue right that's actually ashley furniture store. and then some of the other other customers out there and you'll notice that pretty much the average is between 30 to 40 percent increase in their conversion rate.
rep,and and this typically happens over a period of 90 to 180 days because it's a machine learning algorithm the more time it spends on your site and the system only gets better and then the improvement only increases month on month but within the first 90 days we ensure that you see at least 10% increase conversions after using unbxd. on high-level here are the elements of site search that we solve today. just pause a second ashish go back one slide yeah so monal you probably will choose one of these e-commerce platforms right atg miva bigcommerce sitecore magento these are some of the popular ones in the market. what we wanted to show you in this slide is irrespective of who you choose you will get benefits from using a professional search provider on top of that platform and you will see between twenty to forty percent better search conversion by using our professionals as people who are specialized in search rather than a standard search that comes out of the box with the platform.
rep,so this is the very <product side> i just wanted to pause on the slide for one second. so there is a basic search that comes out with each e-commerce platform that basic search will give you some basic conversions but by using a company that specializes only in search you will get much higher conversion rate that's the main point you want to get driven with this this slide. and we have out of 1200 customers we have it is spanning across multiple backends atg sitecore miva bigcommerce etc so this is an important slide so i paused one second. questions on this slide monal.
prospect,no i mean because well my question is to we will also be we have a b2b side as well that are building division dealers and distributors purchase on and it's very similar to our current website so it will also be moved over to the new platform so it's interesting to see that you have b2b on here as well.
rep,absolutely we have many b2b customers ib supply carrier us auto is one of the largest b2b suppliers suppliers we're working with so we have almost 30 to 40 different b2b large sites that we're supporting <first>. and b2b requires some special things like lot of b2b customers don't do a product search but they do what do you call it as sku search so we support that. a lot of b2b pricing is very different you have different prices for different segments of customers so what we call as a dynamic pricing so we support those functionality also that is required for b2b business. any any questions monal before i proceed.
prospect,okay. no i don't have any.
rep,awesome so on high level here are the components of unbxd site search right that we solve today small autosuggest i'll show you few examples core search and advanced search in terms of how the relevancy works and how relevant the results are with unbxd. we have a few of the algorithms which are tuned per industry just like navin said very specific challenges for b2b versus b2c for home furniture versus apparel right so few of the elements of algorithm that we tune per vertical per industry the back end merchandising dashboard which is which is similar a non-technical i would say a non it merchandiser can also use the tool to run promotions or to promote products or to merchandise products and on a day-to-day basis. mobile optimized everything that we are talking about today here is mobile optimized and over and above that we have built a few elements very specific to mobile because we actually work with few of these companies in apac wherein they see almost 80 to 90 percent of the traffic are coming on mobile so we kind of specialize in supporting mobile as well. and lastly obviously the reports in terms of how detailed reports do <>.
rep,so let me not bore you with with these screens and show you a few of our live customer examples in terms of how we approach the business element or i would say the autosuggest. let me just make sure you see my screen do you see my screen the parts warehouse the vac parts.
rep,okay awesome so this is the site this is the new site parts warehouse but this is how it used to look like before they came to us they had two different search boxes because they had two different kind of visitors on their site one who used to search by part the other who used to search by model right. and then and vac parts actually sells home appliance parts so we came in we said you can not have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box what if they choose the wrong search box and instead what we build is something like this. the moment i start typing in the cell on the left hand side it starts showing me parts for the cell on the right hand side it starts showing me all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for the cell here is another customer of us us patriot tactical. they they sell military apparel to us citizens and and and one of the things for them that's important is the brand and some of the categories within the brand right and here you notice the moment i start typing in ni it starts showing me some of the popular brands starting with ni which is nite ize night vision apparel.
rep,and then some of their popular categories within these these brands right nike and then in socks in air force boots and stuff right not just that it start showing some of the top query and on the right hand side it starts showing me some of the popular products right and and typically nike because nike is one of the most popular brand on the site. say this week this particular black boot on the fourth product became more popular then this black boot would go on top and and the others would automatically come down in the order here is another one that i would actually want to show you which is say express <>. if i was to type in jean and then and express being being a brand for them what is important is category than some of the popular products within each category right so if i was to type jean and i was to look at jeans for men women in loose you see that they also change the popular products change in real time right. now if this week blue jean is more popular then that automatically comes up here and some of the various different categories within blue jean and then some of the other popular jeans on the on the side right and every all of these you'll see happens in real time and highly personalized for each user.
rep,and and the last example i want to show you is and i know this is not from your vertical but wanted to show you the breadth of our solution in terms of how customized this could be big basket dot com they are the second largest grocery retail in apac right. and the challenge they had was repeat visitors buy similar products in their every grocery run and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to even by 10 to 15 products for them to go to search bar search the product go to the product page add to cart and then checkout right so instead what we did is build something like this. the moment i start typing in chicken starts showing me me all the options for chicken with the delivery option like quantity and add to cart on the right hand side it starts showing me some of the commonly searched terms popular brands and categories starting with chic not just that we added personalization to it. meaning if i am buying chicken nuggets on the site more often i would see chicken nuggets on top but if you are buying masala chicken more often then you would see masala chicken on top.
rep,so you can notice all these customers right there all from different verticals different industry and every customer had a specific challenge or a requirement that that we understand we understand the user behavior and try and implement that into our autosuggest and why autosuggest because that's the first interaction that the customer is making on the site. so it's important that that you expose the right categories the right products from the very few first few alphabets that they start typing on the site any any questions on these.
prospect,no i don't so the one that you showed us on the best online groceries that one actually that does interest me i like how not that we have a lot of return shoppers but i like the fact that if they start typing in then it just <meet lee> it comes up for them to can you can you do that again and then actually like click click on one of the products.
rep,monal i think you <>  have pointed out here b2b customers would also like it a lot because lot of b2b customers know the products so this screen is designed for people who don't want to go to product detail page and just want to reorder same thing and b2b business people would like to order from that page itself and move on. well our b2b site have some technology like that built into it has what we call a quick order so they can just type in the product number and it pops up good method <another> product number. we we also have the ability to <>. ashish for monal's benefit go to place an order from the search box itself of big basket yeah and then add to the cart right there.
rep,monal our point here is not that this particular screen is very good or very bad our point is we don't dump our search engine on your doorstep.
prospect,we actually customize it to what are the challenges do you have and we sit down with your business team to say these are three things that you would like to see in your search.
rep,and while we have great technology and machine learning we spend time understanding your business and customize the ui of origin based on what you're looking for. so i just want to quickly also show you this because you mentioned the sku number right here is a customer wherein we do a lot of help them with a lot of search on sku number because they have the they have visitors coming on the site buying same products again and again so that's the item number but if i was to type say 42 or say you wcp it automatically starts pulling up products with the sku number also.
rep,so we do have the ability to a do search or say autosuggest include autosuggest by any of your product catalogue attributes right could be the description could be the name category any of those. b by sku number and not just that we also have the ability i know you mentioned some of some of the articles right that that you also have on site but if you have any documents any articles on the site we can also make that searchable and add that on to your autosuggest piece as well. so any piece of<> let me go back to my slides it's in screen can you see can you see my screen the structure ui for query. okay so here is a here is another example when the query is very broad right and then crosses multiple categories say if i was to look for mobile on an electronic site mobile could mean i'm looking for mobile phone mobile headphones cases and covers we have the technology to identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity.
rep,not just that but immediately we start showing results for the most popular or the most obvious category which is mobile here so you will notice we have started showing mobile phones now over a period of time if mobile covers and cases became more popular than headphones then cases and covers would comm on position two and headphones would go to position three. here is an another example of something that we build as a build as a demo for outnet that sells a lot of designer apparel on site now if i was to look for alexander wang who's a designer and makes totes shoulder bags dresses boots you'll see all of these products neatly bucketed into each category giving customer the ability to browse through these products horizontally or vertically on a single page. here is an another example of how you can you can show similar products in really quick to customers right so say i like the shoes that could be hundred reasons why i like the shoes it could be the price could be the colour could be the design right. the customer clicks on see similar products opens up a modal window because the customer like the product they click on the product they don't they can close the modal window and go back onto the search results page.
rep,any any questions and then these are these are the customizations business pieces the ui elements which are very specific to customers right and can be tuned or can be designed very specific to your site but any any questions in general.
prospect,i'm sorry i had on mute no i i don't have any questions i guess the big question is you know once we determine what platform that we're moving to is if you can't integrate with that and like you said most of the more popular once you can but i'm not sure one of the more popular ones. so i would have to look into that i'm she i saw a demo of one that had a great search function built into it but it would be interesting to see if it does what your your technology does so i'm not sure until i get there and dive into it.
rep,sure ashish i think why don't you quickly go through technology then we can talk about our sas offering softening and how can work so can you just go through technology quickly and then we can spend last 10 minutes on the business case and how we can make it work. monal i assume we have an hour for this call is that correct we have 25 minutes.
prospect,let me see i think i had for an hour yeah yeah.
rep,okay so ashish can we finish the rest of the technology piece the next 10 odd minutes. yeah i'll quickly walk you through these so few elements and then and the core of of the technology depends on <> and the way we've build our relevancy algorithm is is to be able to understand the 12 different types of queries. and these are the only 12 types of queries that can occur in a product search right to give you an example an exact search when i'm looking for an exact product name or i'm looking for an exact sku number on the site right. a feature search it could be say a black dress wherein black is a feature of the product dress thematic search could be party tops that party is the theme of the product top right or say a natural language query.
rep,wherein someone comes and looks for a drawer under $100 right and the the technology that unbxd build is able to understand 85 to 90% of all these 12 different types of queries right. i'll share this with you but here is a quick snapshot in terms of what industries see what kind of queries in industry right in general but and i'll share this with you after the call. but with regards to relevancy right there are a few elements to relevancy that starts at contextual awareness right typically whatever site search systems you see outside there are a rext pattern match. to give you an example say if i was to look for a nike black field boots all the traditional systems would do one of the three things which is or-ing nike or black or field or boots and start pulling up all the products with those words in the description or in the title.
rep,and then the second thing is and-ing which is nike and black and field and boots or minimum match when they would go and do nike and black or nike and field or boots right so a mix and match of and-ing and or-ing right. but with us we have built a system which is able to understand the intent of the customer how we do it is breaking those those search queries into different pieces and trying to understand what is the product type right. what is the colour type say nike is the brand type now black is the colour and field boots are more the product type right so we understand the intent that that customer is actually looking for a field boot which is black in color and from a brand nike right and we start showing the results accordingly. not just that on top of it what also comes in is popularity which comes through machine right meaning say then you you have 20 different black boots but which is the one that you want to so on top and why right and and that's that comes from machine learning.
rep,what is it that people are clicking more what is it that people are buying more we are able to understand that and change the order of products in real time based on that popularity not just popularity but also geo-location say there is a particular boot which is more popular in new york versus california right. so obviously someone coming from new york would want to make sure you show them the boot which is more popular there versus someone coming from california you want to show them a particular boot that's much more popular in california right so it also brings in geo-location any typical festivities in in those particular regions right. and then we start showing the relevant results and this is all dynamic and in real-time and that's why i said right the more time the system spends on your site the better the conversions get right so if within the first 90 days say you might see 10%. but within within 180 days you might be looking at a 20% increase in conversion right and then at the end of the year we're still looking at at an increase in conversion on a monthly basis right so that's the kind of technology that has been built with regards to solving relevancy.
rep,any any questions here.
prospect,i don't have any.
rep,on top of it two things that we do right the machine learning algorithm actually learns based on two things one is the first thing is on your site right what is people behavior how do they misspell words how do they search for products and then what is it that they click on or they buy right. we understand that behaviour and start i would say putting that into the technology onto our algorithm and analytics over and above that we also i would say crawl the web on a regular basis right and understand how people are searching outside on the web right and then what's their behaviour. and that's where <> some of the trends and festivities come into picture right some of the slang words which have been used on on web and people come and try to search that on your site whether your system is  able to understand that because it has the outside knowledge and the inside knowledge within your system. on top of it what we have built is a multi-word spellcheck right which is able to automatically correct a search query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.
rep,in this example you will see black leather jacket all three are misspelled but we are able to auto correct it and in real-time we start showing the results we don't wait for customers to click onto something right. and then we again understand this from user behaviour on the site in terms of how they misspell what are the kind of products they look at we look at what do they mean by by you know when when they start typing in blak right or if they misspell black without the c we are able to understand that what they mean is a black as a colour is what they are looking for right and then start showing the results in the right order. on top of it comes the stemming algorithm sorry the round glasses versus rounded glasses right i one of the example i showed on your site was cart versus carts right. this is something which is again a part of it is built internally and then a part of it is also machine learning on your system or specifically to your site.
rep,which helps you reduce any effort in terms of building this manually with all the traditional systems what you'll end up doing if you build <> all your spelt words right you someone has to go and look into you have regularly misspelled words that start creating synonyms are are redirects for those words and same thing for stemmed words start creating huge library manually at the back end but with us this is again taking care of automatically. ashish why don't you come to the the merchandising section and then after that the roi. sure one of the key pieces i i actually wanted to show was variances i mean before i get into that i notice that monal you sell a lot of products in variances in various different colour variances .
rep,i noticed you sell a lot of products with colour variances on the site today.
prospect,yeah absolutely.
rep,so when i when i see those products i actually noticed that you show the primary image of the product right so there's a white draw or a white i think it was a drawer or a chest that is being shown i'm sorry the cubicle organiser and if i have to see the one in black then i have to go and click on the swatch the black swatch and to probably see the see the image. but with us we have built a technology that is able to identify right the right product for a search results page so to give you an example say a red dress not if you have red dresses if you have the red red dress image as i would say for the that particular variants available the system will be able to automatically pull up the red dress image and start showing them as for the search results right unlike the gray and the black and the blue that is that's being shown here in this example. then the result page we take care of the zero result page highly personalized for each user in real time by showing them recently viewed products and recommendations which are which are typically based on their behaviour on the site their affinities towards a brand towards colour towards a price point so let me now jump onto the merchandising controls and let me actually walk you through a live demo of it rather that showing you some of the screenshots.
rep,are you able to see my  screen. okay so here is the merchandising dashboard which we have built this particular demo site and this is what you get once we implement the solution right and eighty-five to ninety percent of the work is done at our end right with regards to say has to say relevancy stemming spell check.
rep,but there are few elements that you would want to control at your end right say running promotions i'll i'll show you why you would need this right but i would say the 10 percent experience is something that you would want to control based on your business some of the insights that you have about your business. so but but you will have an high level overview in terms of how your site is today what are the number of products what's the feeds size look like what are your product catalogue fields on the site for a searchable non searchable what kind of filters do you have on the site we can also help you manage the filters on the site. then we also give you the ability to create synonyms and to to specifically i would say emphasise on this this is not for synonymous words this is not for misspelled or stemmed words but this is for industry jargon right. so say for one of our customers and is selling to weightlifting world and in their world shoes are called lifters and there is no way we would know that shoes are called lifters in the weight lifting right and and it wouldn't make sense for us to add that into our universal corpus.
rep,because lifters might mean totally different thing in a different industry altogether so in that case what what merchandisers can come and do here is lifters equal to shoes which is bidirectional create synonym and done. now whenever someone is looking for lifters they they are taken to shoes or even the other way around if they are taken and if they are looking for shoes if you have lifters on the site they automatically get redirected to lifters that was one of the elements. now let me show you how you can create rules for search so this is where you can create any global rules which are which are for all your search queries on the site and let me show you how you can create rules for a particular query. so say dress merchandise now if on the live site if i was to go in look for dress you'll notice the first to blue dress the striped and the brown dress here i'm gonna and go back under the dashboard i see the same.
rep,i would say the replica of my live site on the dashboard the first two blue dresses the stripe and the brown dress now this is the 90% experience that i was talking about these are all relevant results based on popularity geo-location user behaviour right highly personalized for each user but even within this you would want to make some changes. say this particular dress is your i would say it's something that's going out of inventory or out of fashion and you want to always promote it and want to have this on position one you can drag and drop and say pin product right this is the dress i want on position two you can drag and drop and say pin product right so that's the pinning. you can filter you can filter based on any of these i would say the product catalogue attribute right based on brand category any of the attributes you can run promotions you can do sorting boosting slotting let me actually show you boosting. so say <>.
rep,monal the products managers you have do you see them wanting to do control the engine in this in this fashion is this something you see valuable.
prospect,sorry i had on mute again i mean i think this is very relevant in fashion but i mean when i go to other sites search as a competitor sites ikea container store and if i say i want a blue fabric door if i type in blue then it will all come up. so i mean doing it by colours certainly interest a brand i guess it would help maybe sometimes our sub brands i mean all the brand is called made but sometimes we do have lines for instance the cubicle line and space creation. so someone you know wanted if we wanted to promote a certain <sub ram> we could.
rep,yeah i think the usefulness of this i mean and i leave you to think about it is if you have a high inventory of a particular product and you want to promote that out so that you reduce your overhead. you want to put before you put them for clearance these are things that you can use but it requires typically companies who have merchandisers will be wanting these functionality and as you continue to grow this is available to you in our engine is that's a key point we wanted to make we wanted to communicate to you. ashish anything else you want to talk about merchandising or shall we just show the roi before <> to monal. yeah i think this is a very high level understanding in terms of the merchandising so you can control basically you can promote you can slot you can even add banners to your search results pages and you can also create landing pages.
rep,you want to run any in your campaigns adwords seo any of your marketing campaigns right you can also control on this particular section to a landing page and you start using the url for your marketing. but that's a very high level understanding the only piece that i would want to quickly show you i'll give you a glance of is the reporting which is three levels supporting a very high-level executive remote reporting gives you an overall understanding of your search performance and your product performances and what are your top searches are what are your top zero results queries. and then if you want much more detailed reporting per query and per product you can you can look at what what's converting what's the conversion rate what's the hit right so say dresses i click on dresses i get a trendline how the how the query is performing and what are the products associated with it. and on the flip side same thing for all your products how each product is performing and against what queries the search queries do these products performing right so that's the another level of reporting.
rep,so three levels of reporting which helps your team to understand in terms of why they need to use merchandising right if a particular query is not working they come back here and then start merchandising for that query to make sure that your results are more relevant or you can say more optimized i would say not relevant but optimized. again there are a few elements very specific to mobile<>. ashish monal has only four minutes for the call let's go to our roi slide so that we can talk through that and also your screen has become small for some reason it's become very small.
prospect,mine is fine it might be in just <the file that you have at your end but i have a very good view of it>.
rep,okay okay now it comes over the full screen okay. here is a sample roi calculation sheet that we have right so we understand what the traffic is on the site just curious if you have any high level numbers in terms of what a search volume looks like what's a product catalogue size what's a conversion rate like.
rep,monal curious you do you have any high-level statistics in terms of what is search volume is how many such sessions do you see on a monthly basis.
prospect,either are we able to track that now with search we don't we're not able to do search sessions are we i am i i don't know and we <>.
rep,do you use google analytics.
rep,okay so yeah you'll surely be able to pull that out from google analytics or in general do you know what what's your traffic like on the site what are average visits on the site today.
prospect,i would say like forty to forty five thousand a week.
rep,a week okay so that's kind drills down to at least i would say fifty thousand of search sessions from an industry standard at least right fifty to sixty thousand of sessions that we are looking for and so the idea is to show you that we provide you a ten percent increase in conversion right. that's the minimum guarantee that we do you and the way we price the solution is that you at least make 10x of whatever you spend with us and if you have these numbers i can actually prepare this our way very specific for closetmaid and share that with you in terms of for you to see how much more revenue you can bring in by using something like unbxd. i mean anything you would want to add here. yeah i think as ashish mentioned we understand you are going to re-platform but let's say there is six months to re-platform for those six months we can give you incremental roi immediately and once you'r re-platform is completed if you see that platform has search you can switch us off.
rep,if you think our search is still better than other search you can continue to use on our search.
prospect,so you can come and start with our current.
rep,we can start with your current.
prospect,it's very difficult to add any technology to our current site i mean i can't even get pixel code for tracking digital ads on my site correctly so i really doubt that i could get your product integrated i'm just being very honest.
rep,why i mean if you are ok we would love for our technical team to take a look at it if it can be done or not can be done and if it can't be done can't be done but but if it can be done <>.
prospect,do you merge with web sphere.
rep,absolutely yes we have lots of customers on web sphere commerce.
prospect,okay because i was told to that one of the main platforms that we're looking at websphere commerce 8 the or door<> which is ibm.
rep,yeah we have at least 10 plus customers on top of ibm websphere commerce also just recently ashish do you remember any websphere commerce customers we went live with. not sure if hh gregg was an ibm websphere commerce customer that we just went live with and with hh gregg we showed a 40% improvement in conversion on on top of their solr implementation. the web sphere commerce uses a technology called solr monal for their search and we typically showed 40% increase in search conversion on top of solr so <>.
prospect,40% .
rep,40% is what we showed to hh gregg.
rep,and the beauty beauty of this whole thing is we don't charge you for re-platforming so if you start with what if you have today and tomorrow when you migrate to websphere if you don't think you need it anymore you can shut it down at that time.
rep,so you have the you enjoy the roi right now and we can work with you to document how much roi your team will get today by adopting this technology and our technical team will do all the integration work we will just need you to give us your product catalogue or an interface to your product catalogue. and our team will do rest of the work and once you re-platform because re-platforming can easily will take at least six to nine months and once you're done with that we will integrate with the web sphere commerce or we will you can continue to use our search at that time so both options remain with you and no additional cost.
prospect,so what is the cost for your technology.
rep,yes to that question we will need a couple of data points from you which is your search sessions and your average ordered value and your current conversions what we can do is we can submit to you we can give you a list of questions that we will need and then based on that we can build a proposal for you and we can also show you the roi impact that will have on your business. and the good thing is the roi will be visible to you in 60 to 90 days so you don't have to wait for one year to see roi all the things that ashish showed you in the beginning of the spell check the stemming the auto correction the auto suggestion all of that would work within five to six months. so by the time first january rolls out for example you start today january one spell correction will be working on your site auto suggestion will be working on your site all those things working on your site.
prospect,okay alright yeah i mean you can send that to myself and i can take a look at it that's you know like i said i'm not sure if right now we want to add any current technology to our site with us going to be you know eventually moving over to a new platform i just don't know that we have it in the budget this year because the majority of it honestly got to go towards the new integration of the new platform so.
rep,well here is a beauty of it right because we are guaranteeing you new revenues you don't have to have a budget so our product pays for itself in the new incremental new revenue you get. so by the time our poc is finished you will get new revenue and if you don't see new revenue you don't have to use our product so that's the beauty of it so let's take an example right so let's say we increase your revenue by five hundred thousand dollars per month and you just have to pay as a fraction of that five hundred thousand dollars that's all so there is no incremental budget asks we make on you or your finances.
prospect,okay alright so you'll just send us this document because we do have to wrap the call up but you'll send us this document we can go through it.
rep,i just looked up my database i just looked at my database hh gregg is on ibm websphere commerce in addition to that if you were looking at for example oracle atg express we have implemented again 34% increase in revenue conversion with them.
rep,smp hybris i don't know if that's another platform you're looking at we have implemented there for liquidation channel magento at mood fabrics miva at market drugs outlet so literally every platform out there the whatever you may choose we have integration already done and implemented on.
prospect,okay alright well yeah send that over and when we have time we've got a couple busy we got a pretty busy week was repairing from eating right prepare for some pretty big sales on closetmaid dot com next week with black friday and cyber monday and all that good stuff. and we're actually down a person on our team now so we've got a lot on our plate but you can send this over and we can hopefully get it back to you fairly quickly i mean because most of these questions and we know fairly easy but then as far as if you could send me a summary email that way i could get val up-to-date on what you i mean i have a good understanding of what you offer. so what your company does but then that way i can least tell her that i have this call with you guys and explain to her what your technology is oh god i'm not sure if you could share that deck with us that you showed us but that would be good.
rep,i'll surely share that.
rep,shall we schedule a follow-up call monal let's say a week from now just before thanksgiving or would you like to schedule after thanksgiving.
prospect,yeah i'd say after because i'm out this friday so.
prospect,okay great thank you we appreciate you reaching out to us and we'll take a look at your questions and we'll try you back with you as soon as we can.
rep,thank you guys.
rep,just curious i think if i remember correctly when i looked up your sights you guys are on endeca today is that accurate.
prospect,yes yes .
rep,okay and and and and you know also what percentage of users are using site searches is it a large number is it below 20 percent about 20 percent.
rep,okay okay well i just wanted to kind of understand how important you know the site search component tool honesty to you guys so moving into the customer experience study so we kind of audited your site we just move into the presentation. hey justin i'm here by the way this one i told you know. okay monal thanks for joining the call so i have gary and ssb on the line to gary is on the merchandising and product team and ssb we saw on the customer experience site and gary you sensory so monal patel is our svp & chief business officer so you know key key works with many for customers i think he's also you know seeing through the implementation with fresh direct itself so he has a very good perspective and some of the challenges retailers like you face also from an endeca perspective and and i think you should be able to talk to you you know walk you through some of those you know challenges and how we're helping addressing them so maybe monal i'll share the screen you know makes you the presenter maybe you could you know walk through the ces or the custom experience study we put together. absolutely hi gary hi ssb i sincerely apologize for being late to this meeting i had some personal issues that i had to take care of and i i just couldn't take care of it in time so i apologize.
rep,all right thank you so hopefully you guys can see my screen yeah okay perfect so just like a jestin sharath explained gary and ssb the plant the idea behind when you talk about site search is not just one aspect of site search there are two different components and we want to surf it open up opportunity and a parody to understand that this is the opportunity be both talking about and what is it that you want to come in and help with so and it's good to know that you know large percentage of our cuts of your customers are using site search and in grocery me that is typically true what we've seen is in grocery with other customers that have bee work with the basket size is roughly 30 to 40 products maybe in some cases 45 as well. so customers are buying a lot of products in a single transaction which is why they want to just get in and get out so they want to quickly do the shopping they don't have the time to do five clicks for every single product whereas they would take 200 clicks so let's get into the specifics of the relevancy and you know we obviously wanted to start showing in terms of what is it that we need by relevancy so starting with the product type query at least we basically we're searching for butter and i'm sure you probably won't run into this problem also you're searching for apples space juice they're looking for apple juice right but it'll start showing apples looking for blueberry something ice cream or blueberry yogurt it will start showing blueberry. so this is what the idea behind relevancy is that i'm looking for a particular product and i'm not necessarily seeing that specific product. however when i go through the navigation so here i search for butter and i get a lot of the vegetable oil and not the butter but when i go through the navigation i actually do see butter. same i want to look at fresh vegetable versus there's a complete category called fresh vegetable and this is where it takes us to go to produce if i then wanted to get gluten-free bread you can see that from a lot of perspectives two sets of problems one you are obviously not seeing with gluten-free bread but you're also seeing sold out items online first now that a problem also cannot you want to show out of stock products up top.
prospect,the thing with this is we have multiple you know use cases one is people buying in stores so they're happy to axle it if they're buying in stores that they don't necessarily they're not trying to ship it to home they can shop up  from the stores.
rep,got it okay got it so it's only it's not available online but if you want if i wanted to physically go to the store it might not still be available.
rep,now do you guys also have a challenge where obviously it's the storage came your multiple stores and prices of milk change per county so you have to maintain different inventory and different prices for your catalog .
rep,okay that is something we can manage as well from our system . now let's get into this.
prospect,one moment just to be clear we've got a store specific assortment as well.
rep,yep absolutely oh so you're saying that if let's say i wanted to go to a particular search queries a search for butter you want <> assortment using you talking that the products that are available in it let's say there's ten butters available in store one there might be fifteen available in store 2.
rep,got it yep so different inventories different stocks and completely some set of products some overlap but maybe not all yep.
prospect,hey monal i got only 15 more minutes to go and i need to run to another meeting so one question is how is your different than endeca what do you do with them.
rep,so i'll tell you three things that we are different from endeca around quickly try to walk you through those. so starting with the autocomplete design let's say we talk about in terms of how relevant the visual autocomplete is second is the relevancy.
rep,endeca is not a contextual relevance engine it gives you the ability to do product discovery and gives you some ability to do merchandising for category pages but when you get into the search pages it becomes the extremely difficult to do in with endeca you can solve it by manually sorting products but that's not a scalable solution because i can look for the same product in a hundred different ways and that's where i need to really solve the contextual relevance so that's the other piece that we're seeing different the third piece is from a perspective of customer success or in terms of the scale aspect. where you talk about filters let's say we talk about i want to show different kinds of filters for different categories of products you can't do that in endeca unless you manually set that up without unbxd with automatically scales third thing is in terms of the manual effort that you might be spending today is solving error corrections and stemming problem so apple versus apple's yogurt versus different misspellings of yogurt everything is to solve all of those systems all of those issues today within endeca you have to create a synonym with unbxd you do not have to create a synonym 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box and it's not because we've built a synonym library on our end it is because we've actually using algorithms to solve these spelling mistakes. the second the last piece is in terms of the integration so if you were to use unbxd to solve site search you do not have to replace endeca we can sit right next to endeca so you can continue you might have years of processing built on top of endeca so you just can't to keep endeca away you don't have to do that for using an unbxd the way unbxd does that is today your application for.
rep,what platform you guys are on atg or.
rep,atg perfect so what's your atg application is doing is it's making a call to endeca and
prospect,atg.
rep,endeca is responding in a certain format what we do is you make the exact pain type of call to unbxd and we will make sure that the response from unbxd is exactly like endeca so your application doesn't have to change anything.
rep,and whatever feed you're putting into endeca you a copy of the exact same piece and we will take that same piece so you don't have to do anything new to integrate unbxd other than make a call to unbxd and send a copy of the catalog to unbxd so the really seamless integration from that perspective.
prospect,got it your proposal is keep endeca but unbxd remain on the side you're going to match the responses but really endeca will become at some point endeca will be you know we can basically remove endeca if you want and then unbox pentacle.
rep,exactly so there's a different option if you have a lot of dependencies on endeca today you can continue to use it if you don't unbxd is every single element that endeca provides for you to replace endeca but you don't have to replace endeca to use unbxd you can use both in parallel and over time when you start to remove the dependencies you can switch to unbxd either option is available.
rep,so you're saying integration between unbxd and endeca or unbxd atg.
rep,it is between unbxd and atg the only difference is let's say you are making a call to endeca either through some object or some api call within the system you make the same type of call to unbxd and the response that are nothing gives back to atg we're looking exactly like endeca the formatting the content it does look like that we like we like endeca except for obviously the product because we make to make sure there's a relevant piece set in so atg doesn't have to look sort of you don't have to do the work onatg site to figure out and say okay now i have to consume this response and figure out how to convert that into how atg understand will respond in exactly the same way that endeca does.
rep,and we all merchandising dashboard so if your merchants and marketing team wants to control and override our base algorithms to solve for any business requirements like inventory clearance or promotion of products the brand promotion etc we also have a much in a very strong orchard at the dashboard should be easy to you and the last piece is be machine learning. so after all of this is done ultimately it's the artificial intelligence and machine learning that two built in then does a lot of figuring out in terms of what products to show when to show how to solve relevancy etc so let's say for example you'll be talking about butter you have fifteen butters that you're buying at first level we want we will start to show the most best performing butters up top for that location for that catalog of inventory eventually you'll also add a layer of personalization and i'll show you an example just to give you a context so here we have a customer called big basket and sorry i'm using a hotel internets it's a little bit slow but let's say if i started to search for bread right and i wanted to i usually buy a multigrain bread versus you always buy the bread brown for that particular brand if we both search for bread i will actually see the multigrain bread up top you will actually see the bread brown up top and there is a few different components in how we can actually create a better user experience for that particular customer is you can see with the autocomplete because customers buy thirty forty forty five products in a single transaction as soon as you start typing in what you're looking for we bring in all the different elements that are important for customers to make a decision to buy if you're these are products they've already bought in the past because in grocery you typically buy the same product every week or every other week we start showing those up top so you can just change the quantity and add to cart from right here for products that you don't normally buy like during seasonal events or some holiday party or summer party etc. you also call me search terms some popular brands and some category as well and and it's not just discs where you can search for any any clear such a search for just a chicken if i'm searching i if i usually buy chicken masala or chicken boneless breast i'll see that up top if if you are looking if you talk to typically buy chicken leg without pin that's what you'll start looking at up top that's the other component on top of all of the relevancy and limitations of endeca is we solve that and on top of that we take the experience to that next level with personalization.
prospect,what is your engine  monal what is your is that elasticsearch.
rep,no we have actually had routine to build a system of our own and we've built all of our components on top of the theme so i'll show you in a second here let's see if i have that particular screen i can show you a .
prospect,solar to are just looking.
rep,no just looking okay give me one second i'll just show you exactly what this thing would look like
rep,there you go so you can see if you were to let the consider solar or elasticsearch as a replacement for endeca what you typically get is that box in the middle what solar and elasticsearch give you is extremely fast search and both of them inherently have usual seen underneath it right . solar is just a wrapper for producing and elasticsearch is another version of how the wrapper around the scene really works so we've actually gone into the scene and we have there are about 30 or 35 committers routine commuters in the world two of them work for us and this is where we tackle theme and then we've built all the blue boxes around this particular component to make it better search solutions so if you look at the top right corner which is ecommerce context awareness. this is where we build our semantic relevance engine the context of our engine those are spell check our own synonym corpus for a lot of aspects you index the world catalog where we have scanned almost a hundred thousand ecommerce sites index almost 200 million products in our own catalogue to build our own synonym corpus then on top of that we all you automatically get the autocomplete someone like i showed out of the box on the left top left you get yourself learning algorithm this is where you get user behavior we've learned this is machine learning components where we start to figure out what products are performing better and then on top of that we also have our personalization component where we start to percolate product that you have bought in the past right. and then and then you have the infrastructure at the bottom bottom left where all of this analysis is done in real time you know there is a huge component of machines that are being spent in real time every minute to try to do a real-time data analysis and it's obviously scales depending on whether you have peak season not peak season the system will automatically scale on the back end and then the right bottom corner is again your merchandise ultimate the business still need control over how the algorithms work because the algorithm can work great but the business ultimately wants control to make sure that they can influence the algorithm for what the business needs.
rep,because we might be showing the the land o'lakes butter all the time because that's the best performing butter let's say but the business is actually let's say gary your team has actually done some agreements with some brands where you want to show a particular brand up top. maybe a new kind of butter has come algorithm not completely you don't have to completely override it but you can control each individual product block and make sure that you start showing specific set of product specific set of brands in specific positions of the result set and you can do this both for search and for category pages by the way.
rep,and then we can create promotional pages landing pages sorry a long-winded answer for your question go ahead.
prospect,all the blue boxes where is hosted is it a sas solution or on premise implimentation.
rep,it is a sas solution it is a sas solution we are hosted on aws as a primary and as your as backup so we are on three locations of amazon in the us and then the fourth location for redundant we gonna geo microphone.
rep,and i thinki also besides the autocomplete you have the relevancy of the spellcheck i think i mentioned that with endeca to resolve spell check you have to do a lot of synonym creation right all of that is sold out of the box but you do still get the ability to create synonyms if you want to .
rep,redirect landing pages ui components dynamic filtering startle variants we have zero results if for any reason you don't carry a particular product we have a unique way of handling zero results by showing recommendations on mobile we have a unique way of showing the auto suggests which is optimized for mobile and even the sort of from a guidance perspective how we guide the customers to a specific set of products filters that are optimized for mobile etc.
rep,are your site is your site mobile optimized within our responsive or adaptive.
prospect,its adaptive.
rep,adaptive got it yep so you can have different experiences both for just up and mobile depending on how you have to find it and these are all the different components in terms of how you can use a merchandise dashboard one last piece get this we i wanted to show you before you leave and you gotta go five minutes but i'll show you our it's a quick video of our merchandising dashboard and this is specifically for the category pages and this is something endeca cannot do today and gary this is this is something we've built with merchants in buying because what we've seen is you spend a lot of time marketing spends a lot of time and effort and money to bring customers from the top of the funnel right you'll do emails till the social media you'll do seo spm a ppc campaigns etc just to bring customers to the site you also have your flyers and customers use your flyers to look online but when they come online the experience is for every single customer is exactly the same no matter where they came from so what we've built is let's say you have a particular category page let's say you have shampoo and for shampoo you want to run a campaign for this week or for two weeks so you can have a start date time and date time and then you can decide how you want to run this shampoo campaign. you can define a particular segment of customers to say i'm gonna send an email promoting say the png shampoo or the pantene one or the garnier one and specifically for customers were coming from email or this geography i want to show a particular experience for the page shampoo page and you can define that segment and control that and will also give you on the right-hand side a forecast of the number of customers you're going to influence based on the historical data. sometimes we might have competing ideas say you you your merchants are making a deal with p&g pantene and garnier and you want to make sure that you're able to shoot both of them you can split the traffic you can create a version a of the merchandising and of course be split traffic 50/50 or 30 30 and then 40 percent is the base algorithm . and you can see how and who the winner is in terms of performance and then for specifically for the merchandising component you have the ability to boost products to slot products to pin products filter out products etc.
prospect,how do you create segments monal like what are the inputs to segment creation.
rep,sure so let's say let's go back a little bit there we go so the way the segments are is here we are showing four segments but you can create custom segments also so the first segment is user type i can have a new user or so repeat visitor then device i can have desktop tablet mobile based on a device based on geography our geography segment can be down to the city level and then the next is the channel you can have it through email channel seo ppc direct organic social media etc so you can have it by channel also and there is a technique that we have also introduced where you can have custom channels let's say you have figured some dma data or you have your loyalty customers and you want to talk to your loyalty customers to email differently then your non loyalty customers to email. then we give you the ability to create custom campaigns or custom segments as well. okay and that's the go ahead.
prospect,sorry there's nothing on there how do you create a <> how do you create graph can you talk about that a little bit.
rep,how do we create graph.
prospect,yeah the data guys you know based on so i mean.
rep,oh knowledge graph. oh got it okay i can show you a quick example of what our knowledge graph technique looks like i don't have it prepared for atg but i did prepare it for another customer give me one second so here's from a technology perspective is what our knowledge graph works like so there's two components of multiple components to the technology p but i'll get into specifics of how the knowledge graph comes into play so when you talk about e-commerce search there are five components around how you enable search you have the semantic relevance you have the infrastructure of the machine learning the merchandising and the personalization so how do we do the actual relevant piece specifically when you talk about relevance key within the scene you have the technique called tokenization i'm sure it's a to europa where with what's tokenization does and then on top of that how do we apply knowledge graph and then do data enrichment and then do semantic relevancy so let me show you what that looks like so let's say tokenization here i have a very complicated query called boss round hammer drill bit so if that's the query that's what i'm looking for what unbxd does through tokenization and we do a lot of techniques we do spell check we do stemming to figure out you know how do we handle terms and
rep,phases so if i have a dishwasher with space without space bathtub with space without space or drill bit toilet seat right i think about it this way i can simplify an example if i'm searching for doors or doorknob when i'm searching for doorknobs i don't want to show doors how do we do that we need to know that doorknobs is a different product than tools right and same thing that organization helps us do that is that we know that bosch is the product round hammer is the feature and a drill bit is the actual product and that is where the usage of the knowledge graph also comes in. we've built this corpus when when we talk about that world catalog indexing the products almost 200 million products within our catalog we've built this knowledge graph to identify how its in term can be correlated to another term from that perspective. and and these sources are obviously your own catalog but we also so then post-processing of the each toconisation and applying the knowledge that we now understand that bosch is the brand around hammer is the feature drill bit is the actual prototype. and then we do some data enrichment based on this synonym corpus that we've also build is there loop at try to figure out to pay we need to talk about it but there is drill bit or driver bit because we've seen that that's both names are interchangeable sometimes so that becomes the actual query into the scene and then we do the semantic relevancy where if you think about solar for example by default it uses a algorithm called tf idf right now tf idf is is the gold standard in search but it is not the gold standard in search for e-commerce because tf-idf only gives you a priority or popularity it does not give you usefulness. right so we have to do this technique on top of tf idf and we call something a idea called relevance game.
rep,the old system with solar or endeca you can do either or-ing or anding in solar you can only doing and ending endecar you can actually do minimum match when they gonna introduce something called minimum match because they were multi keyword queries coming in and so it's called strict or loose right and i don't know how much do you get into be for the techniques of stuff but what happens is just to give you a side context.
rep,right and i don't know how much do you get into be for the techniques of stuff but what happens is just to give you a side context. let's say i'm searching for a women's by jean and the numbers in the red are the tf-idf score now when i'm searching for genes why is a white top coming up because sometimes it would say that this this white top goes great with gene just because the keywords exist doesn't mean it's a relevant product and that's why the idea score will be higher than other jean so what we come in and apply is a layer called relevant game which then gives you the ability ability to say when i look at white jeans women and idf women will be the highest score then white and then gene but after the relevance game will know that jean is higher than women and then white. and so now what happens is we push more jean up top push that white top towards the bottom. however white top is still in the result set so now we apply an elimination technique this is where because of the word catalog and the ability to understand what a product is and what a product attribute is we know that white top is the top and not a jean the customers looking for jean be going and exclude the white top and we push more jean up top . then comes in the user behaviors this is a machine learning piece that we were talking about where we come in and start looking at the clickstream data to see what is the best performing product and then we start make sure show that product up top automatically.
prospect,in that case lets take same butter example that you give earlier customer comes to buy hundred and forty different butters but if the ten different the users who came in always there clicking on on the search results page clicking on landed on unsalted butter for the <> who comes in to push that to the top how are you capturing that real-time quick stream data.
rep,so we are going to deploy our own analytics on your site as well so we have very similar to your google or omniture.
rep,do you guys use google or amateur what do you guys use today.
prospect,yeah both we use both.
rep,you use both so similar to the amateur google analytics tag we will also deploy our own tags on the site so we we capture the real-time analytics using our own our own analytics tracking and we capture every single track every single click so you have views click add to cart orders etc and that real-time data gets fed back into the system which again starts to calculate in view and that's where the personalization component comes in this is where the personalization component comes in . where while collaborative piece you know ten customers are clicking on that land o lakes which is the 15th in the result set so we'll start to percolate the 15th products to the first position slowly and the 11th customer comes in and starts to click on that 12th product we start to make sure we try to track everything in real time to start showing that product up top also but to on top of that that's the collaborative piece but on top of that we also do personalization where i come in and i'm always buying the some other brand of butter i can just seem to remember which one which are the one but not the land o'lakes i'll start to see that butter up top instead of the land o'lakes specifically for me. and there's a lot of techniques on personalization yes we there's we you be very priority algorithm we look at what customers are clicking on is there a few keep affinity to a brand affinity to category affinity to in terms of pricing so there's a lot of techniques that we used but in grocery there's so much repeatability that there's very strong signals that when they buy something one time there's high probability to buy that again unless it was a very seasonal item so those times those types of classifications is something that we do to understand which products were actually consider for personalization and which ones to not. right and then we also do you know and then these personalizations are by the way attract not just as an individual level but also as a collaborative levels by geo it's not just entire sites for everybody if we can we do and can group them within geo locations as well and then we also do.
prospect,how do you get that geo location monal.
rep,using the ip address you can get using the ip address.
prospect,so once again to your tag you take collected data from the hammer.
rep,correct exactly you got it yep and for geolocation we can get down to the city level up to the city level.
rep,okay and then some of these techniques diversification etc are very popular for apparel maybe that's what applicable to grocery but i since it is part of our sort of offering what we also do is try to mix in the result set that so you know a lot of times in apparel world showing the same types of product do results in higher get rates so let's say i came to a category called dress i already saw those dresses that i saw up top the first time i came in and in that same session i again come back to the dresses category showing me the same product is not going to help. so we started to diversify the products based on what that customer might have clicked on if there was some brand affinity etc some pricing filtering that they might have applied or color etc we try to create some diversity then there's some new arrival products found variety in terms of style to sara so we do that as well . and then the comes in the freshness piece this is where more heavily trending on the definitely have attending on the apparel because every eight weeks you will get new style so how do we make sure that we start to sprinkle in because otherwise new products will never get to see the light of day right only the best performing products will always be up top so this is where these freshness component also brings in and the ways some of the clicks on the fresh of the new arrival product heavily to give them a little bit better boosting because they don't have as much history behind them . and then the comes in the freshness piece this is where more heavily trending on the definitely have attending on the apparel because every eight weeks you will get new style so how do we make sure that we start to sprinkle in because otherwise new products will never get to see the light well .
rep,so so that's the entire strand of the relevant tips this is how the relevancy solved from our perspective.
prospect,very good monal this has been very helpful to me to turn the  unfortunately i do need to go all the time but you know i will catch up the gary afterwards and we will.
rep,okay perfect and if you have any questions afterwards also see please don't hesitate to reach out to us and we'll be more than happy to answer more questions if you want to see the back and infrastructure how do we build that etc you can get into those details as well like the latency stuff how do we maintain 300 milliseconds or 99 point 99 uptime etc we can get into those conversations as well because i'm sure that's also important for you. less.
prospect,yeah yeah very good thank you so much.
rep,absolutely thank you yes we really appreciate the time yeah so gary i obviously hijacked the entire conversation around product and technology i wanted to take the opportunity and be did we talk about something that you really wanted to drill down into or get into more details but something that we can answer you have a question around.
prospect,no i mean we were impressed with with the products when we saw the detail.
prospect,and we wanted to get just as we engaged in the conversation so that he can see and understand what we had already seen.
rep,gotcha so from that perspective gary.
rep,yeah so we're we're actually a very complex situation we do have you know the main site is on atg but that's relatively a small portion of our business .
prospect,okay. our exponentially growing business right now is our curbside pickup service that's right you you know and and that's how's gonna in another platform .
prospect,are you familiar with the with them.
rep,i have heard of them yep .
prospect,they're out of toronto. so you know i'd be just as interested to understand if it's possible to do any kind of integration
rep,yes. with you know. yeah so from our perspective gary the approach that we take we have different approaches the endeca approach of the atg approaches our back-end approach there's also a front-end approach that we can use which is platform agnostic. and even the back end approach that we talked about and data is also platform agnostic so we have restful api for back-end and we respond in json or xml and any platform can consume something like that but if you don't want to do a back-end you don't want to spend too much time and effort changing the back and you can also do this on the front end i'll show you exactly what i mean.
rep,let's say if you go to the express and if i let this search for a dress.
rep,so as you can see this header all the way up to say express is the logo and then where it says sign and card etc you can create a page with the header and the footer with mt in the middle and through the front end we can we can start showing the results of exactly what the search results should be based on our relevancy and that's exactly what we've done with express here . so starting with the 269 here all the way down to the class result everything gets shown by unbxd. and we can still control the same requirements like the assortment pricing etc based on that score all you have to do is pass in that store number two us and so how you might have already asked the customer to define a store a liquor store etc through that process and then automatically that catalog and that inventory becomes available to the search system. so we have our from our approach we've worked with a lot of different platforms atg ibm hyper <> and i'm sure magento bigcommerce shopify even systems which have no backend access we've been able to integrate with those also the front end.
prospect,okay very interesting.
rep,and what's the time frame gary in terms of what you're looking to i'm sure from your curb side which is growing enormously customers are coming obviously online and you want to get them in and out as quickly as possible online and curbside.
prospect,so so at the same time that that is growing and we're trying our best to keep up with that business we are looking at doing some redevelopment of our atg site. so the conversations were having with you or very timely.
rep,okay can you give me some idea on just a high-level time frame gary is it like you're looking to do this the next two months six months orders of the 2018 project you're doing due diligence right now.
prospect,yeah we intend to have at least at least the major portion of the changes completed in september.
rep,okay got it and are you are you anticipating that we can come in and help as part of that change so you can have something more exciting from a search perspective in september.
prospect,yeah so perhaps right.
rep,<> yeah absolutely that make sense so gary from a merchandising perspective let me ask you do you get into conversations with brands etc where you need to come in and you know as part of your other negotiations that you do at soy in a bone in terms of say look i'm going to put you digitally up top here's what my search query volume looks like and if i let's say for example shampoo i have a hundred thousand people searching for shampoo every month p&g if you give me a better deal on this i better put you in the second and the third position these particular products for a month or something like that do you guys get into those kinds of requirements.
prospect,you know what i would tell you is we probably wouldn't do it as you just explained we we have a philosophy here that kind of takes us away from that but we would use the techniques you described to promote and advocate customer purchase the items that we we want to we want customers to know and to understand.
rep,sure sure sorry go ahead.
prospect,part of our go-to-market strategy is to really you know we're a little bit different kind of retailer we're all about providing whatever our customers want we're gonna have it but we also bend over backwards to create new and unique and distinctive items that you can only get here and so you know we don't want to essentially boost those so we'd use that technique.
rep,yep no that's that makes sense i'll show you how easy it is gary to do something like that and i don't know whether you saw that when you were here let me just try to quickly refresh this page okay let's say and unfortunately on this demo account i have a apparel catalog so i'll just show you in that context but let's say i want to create a new campaign i want to say a test and i want to start today at the end tomorrow and you can define different sorts of stuff on different devices and the other segments by the way. so gary from your perspective that's an important distinction if you're making this unique item what is the consumption of these unique items in desktop versus mobile because if you are doing your curbside pickup or your regular business as well our customers are typically looking at it in the mobile and immobile you want to make sure that you know some of the products that you want them to discover our within the first five or ten products right the customers don't like to scroll that much on those sorry . so you can you have that kind of that level of control as to what you want to show and this by the way applies both to search and to the category pages not just search and then i can either start merchandising because i actually have some results when i search for a dress or as a category dress or i can create a custom landing page. so here let's say i start merchandising and let's i want to slot so slotting is the technique that we're talking about so let's say in position three and four i want a particular type of product i'm just going to say title contains let me see what's available here ah ralph laurel. so in instantly on the preview right here on the right hand side you'll see that position three and four is showing your floral products so now you can come in and say for a category called that's a dinner item help me out here gary what kind of unique products do you guys create some category .
prospect,so let's say we had a flag just a flag that said our distinctive items so we were .
prospect,so we could so it would be distinctive contains yes.
rep,there you go you got it and can exactly you're absolutely correct so in three and four it will automatically bring those distinctive items. now let's say those two top items within the distinctive flag yes we're not a stock for whatever reason use the over sold etc so automatically it will replace in these two positions with the next two distinctive item there are in line and automatically remove the other one you can also pin them so if let's say i wanted to pin a particular products that i want to pin something in the fifth position and i want that to pick this bright red one so pick 5 it pin and right there you can see that particular product will go into that position so and then if this product goes out of stock and if you have a rule to say don't show out of that product it'll automatically remove it from that position .
prospect,okay very good.
rep,yep and then you can create an entire experience around it also where you can add a banner i'll show you next you can add html banner image banner etc and what we're also coming out with is a layout so you can define a particular kind of layout for that page and how you want the customer experience to look like sometimes you have very few products you want to show you don't want filters on the left hand side some times we want to show a content and filters and products together so it depends on how you want it we are coming up with the techniques and the features that will allow you to control different types of layouts as well. and then you hit publish and it's like you can go live instantly or you can schedule it to go live at a particular date and time and this is how you will show you you can create multiple campaigns around just to query interests you can stop the campaign you can delete duplicate we're also coming up with showing you right here in the box a trend as to how is it doing is it actually going up compared to the previous day going down so you can constantly monitor in one skill to what this particular campaign is doing . now if you wanted to create custom campaigns you can create that too let's say you wanted to do april clearance. i'm just making this up let's say april clearance i'm going to say test clearance start today it ends tomorrow i'll pick everything again test. now april clearance is a unique keyword nothing matches in the catalog called april clearance so you won't see any results so you can click here on the left saying create a landing page when you do that you automatically get the entire catalog available for you to curate now. if you can curate based on whatever rules you want to create if that particular products based on that rule is not available at that store it will automatically not show and if it is available it will automatically start to show based on that rule set so you don't have to create rule for every single store you just create your rules and things will fall into place according to whether they are available at that store or not.
rep,and then same technique available here you can filter you can boost sort slash pin etc and then you can publish that page and now you can take the url with a april clearance and put it in your email campaign social media campaigns seo ppc etc this is how.
rep,yeah we're five minutes five to ten minutes would it take typically depending on how many rules you want to create they can get something up and running and that's quickly.
prospect,yeah so i'm gonna get with y'all office visit a little bit later today and we'll kind of talk through what the next steps are i think it would be valuable to have you come down .
rep,okay absolutely.
prospect,just roughly what is your what is your business model you know.
rep,to make money.
prospect,there is this is a service that we that we you know pay for one time instead of monthly fee done yeah.
rep,right so it is a monthly fee we are a sas that's sas  models it's a subscription model and it is a monthly fee so there's two types of fees one there's a small set up fee and then there's a monthly fee the set up fees calculated typically as 2x or 3x of the monthly fee depending on what kind of customization we need to do on our end to help you set it up but more importantly gary we come up with a poc model because i can show you fanciest presentations i can talk really fancy stuff and show you amazing slide it means nothing unless you actually try it. so what we usually talk about is do a quick poc it typically takes four to six weeks to get up and running with our solutions with the front end approach and we try for 60 days or 90 days however much a long time you want to try. to see that this is actually working for you and not only you should see an uptick in conversion you should see an uptick in average order values also but what we do is we guarantee that you will see an uptick in conversion.
rep,if you don't see an uptick in conversion you have the option to walk away if you do see and we typically price ourselves where we will create at least a 10 x or a 20x roi of our solution to what our cost is the say we are making charging you fifty four five thousand dollars a month you will at least see fifty two hundred thousand dollars in incremental revenue and they are a minimum you could see a lot more too but i know grocery business is very very thin thin margin so we try to price ourselves and to make sure that they're at least making you money and you're only paying.
rep,and we can send you some a bunch of questions gary if you can answer them and they can sign an nda if that's what's required and we can give you an roi sheet where you can see that this is what our current performance looks like if we were to include unbxd let's say they only increase conversion by five percent what is that roi going to look like you think we did by ten percent what is it roi looks like. and our fees are pretty flat regardless how much money we make you.
rep,so either me or justin we're going to bother you you tell us how much time you need and when should we start bothering you again.
prospect,so we're gonna need at least a week.
rep,okay can i in the mean time gary send you those questions and if you if you want us to find an nda we can do that as well in the mean time you can share some of those numbers to us we can provide an roi sheet and i can come up with the entire gambit of the presentation come out there we can pick a time when everybody's available on your end present the entire front to back end maybe maybe 60 to 90 minutes time if you can allocate and we can present everything in one shot and then you guys can take a call.
prospect,yeah notice let's have a conversation before we before we take that step.
rep,sure sure absolutely what i'll do is i'll i'll send you the questions if you guys decide to move forward and whatever the next steps are noticeable this that's our to get us those numbers if nda is required not required i'll let you i'll leave it up to you.
prospect,okay that sounds very good.
rep,okay perfect and then if you don't hear from you before then we'll try to bother you sometime next week like say tuesday or wednesday.
prospect,yeah it needs to be after tuesday there's a major.
rep,after major.
prospect,yes happening on tuesday so.
rep,absolutely we'll see but make it wednesday not a problem at all .
prospect,yeah okay very good thank you guys for your time i have to run i've got a meeting but i appreciate you walking us to this .
rep,absolutely gary thank you for the opportunity thank you for remembering after such a long time from etail west so we really really appreciate you giving us a chance to talk again today and we look forward to hearing from you again.
prospect,thank you so much okay.
rep,absolutely you're welcome thank you.
rep,good morning julie how are you.
prospect,good morning. well ashish is here as well.
rep,this is ashish with unbxd are you waiting for anyone else.
prospect,i don't think so no are we here. no i don't think so either.
rep,okay okay awesome great just to introduce myself i'm part of the smb sales team at unbxd family work out of our sunnywale office and i'm here to walk you through a report that we did on your site primarily on the part of discovery side of it and i'll quickly share my screen so that you'll be able to see. that but before i get started. yes go ahead.
prospect,i just had a quick question what was the impetus to this i mean did we ask you or is this like a gratis type of review that you're doing for different organizations or what prompted this report .
rep,sure absolutely i think this came as a follow up to niva right niva what we typically do we need a lot of i would say ecommerce retailers at various the different events so today our theam is that shop tops happening in vegas otherwise we also attend etail west etail east and then we meet a lot of people that say niva using niva merchant today. and we do a quick study on their site in terms of things which are working which are not working things that you might want to improve to eventually increase the conversions on the site and primarily from a product discovery perspective right from in terms of how people search the products how easily they can basically find the products and hence convert right so most of our findings are around those areas so one of my colleagueabhishek was probably trying to reach you and your team to see if you are at niva we could do this in person there but looks like that did not work out and then and that's where does i think the phone today.
prospect,i think the phone was site search today i'm interested to see what your findings were how about you anna. same here.
rep,sure i will i will quickly share my screen i would want to show you some visuals so i hope you will have you will be able to see the screen i allow you to go to meeting if any was to share my screen.
rep,so this is an extended version of the of the study that i'm going to walk you through but what i'm also going to send you after the call is a much more i would say a compact version of this with some real-time feedback in various i would say crisp feedback from the users which you can also circulate internally within a team but to walk you through this complete report which is i'll walk you through this.
rep,so also before i get started i was just curious is it was there something in specific that caught your interest when abhishek was trying to follow up are you looking to improve anything on the site search side of it anything that's on top your head so that i can focus more on those areas for the discussion.
prospect,i actually you know i'm not speaking for ana but my primary right now is we are going through a redesign for a new wholesaler and i although i do some work i'm wondering if and in ana this is something that i'm just thinking about this is something that maybe rachel would get some value from too since she manages yes i can i can send her a quick meeting we recently just for your information it we recently kind of reorged and we realigned our entire marketing division and so we now have different types of ownership for the brands that are under our parent company plasto ad and although anna and i both do an you know we do support ids done. company plasto ad and although anna and i both do an you know we do support idzone. we do have a primary contact or brand ambassador for the ideas own brand and i'm wondering if this might be really helpful for her too i can give she i can see really quickly as you continue with your presentation if she is available.
rep,so absolutely that really make them also so curious how many more websites do you have i know heidi hold id wholesaler and idzone but any other websites that you own today.
prospect,yep southeast id dot com and badge express calm and plasco id dot com.
rep,okay so in total five sites.
rep,and your idzon site is today for niva marchant and you are using searchspring are the other four sites also pretty much same infrastructure or is it kind different.
rep,heard me.
rep,so on id zone i notice that it's running on niva merchant and searchspring for your site search so is it the same infrastructure on other sites as well or is it different.
prospect,it's same on other site as well.
rep,so from agenta perspective what i have was very high level three things that i wanted to do on this call today a talk a little about us would not take more than couple of minutes then primally walk you through a few examples from your site there in we believe right you can immediately improve the product discovery some of the key elements on site search and recommendations that you should you might want to look at and then lastly i can discuss any next steps it is something that interests you you are looking to change i we can talk a little more details about how we can take it to the next steps.
rep,but talk about us you're a six years old company at what are at mountain view work with offices in chicago and a back end engineering office in bangalore india as well we work with over 1200 sites globally 120 plus customer brands right here in the us we serve over 1.
rep,5 billion search interactions of month larger than the top three etailor put together in the us from any customer base perspective you work with all sizes of customers across verticals.
rep,work with some of the top fashion brands like express rue21  hardware and b2b id supply us auto parts parts warehouse from the large online parts retailers usauto parts actually as a 100 million product catalog size because they are the largest auto parts retailer out there in the us from electronics hhgreg fresh direct a large grocery retailer in the northeastern part of the country ashley furniture home store one of the largest online furniture store in the us.
rep,from platform perspective we're fit all platforms like the way a solution has been built is its platform agnostic you can integrate into niva we do have a plugin for nia which also makes the implimentation very smooth and very easy but irrespective even in future if you plan to change the the e-commerce platform it does not restrict you from using unbxd. i'm sure you understand the importance of search but one of the most important things that i want you to highlight on this slide here is that one of the research from chiquitos is 80% of our visitors will leave your site after having a poor search experience and the reason being they're so habitual of searching on google or amazon and getting the most relevant results that they believe every site right every e-commerce sites also work in the same way it will also show the results similar to what google or amazon does. and if you do not show it probably will not carry those products and hence they would move back to google amazon or maybe any other competitor site. here is a quick quote i wanted to put and highlight some of our achievements by putting this quote here by david the ceo at express he quoted us 90 days after the we went live during his queue to call earnings call at wall street and the reason was the impact in conversion that we can bring him within the first 90 days of going live life. here are some very high-level statistics of various different customers in terms of what's the impact conversion rate and the revenue we could bring in they didn't say 90 days of going live furniture home decor is ashley furniture home store one of the largest in the country and and the conversion rate includes that could deliver for them or 60% and revenue was a approximately 30% .
rep,one of the new york customer on searchspring uptick of 11% on conversion rate 22% in revenue. and the reason we were able to do this right is here is an example from from express blue jeans before and unbxd and after unbxd they used to show a lot of blue products products maybe ever made of jeans but not blue jeans by itself. because of unbxd and then there are three pieces of the technology machine learning personalization and contextual search what we could deliver was 60% uptick in revenues within the 90 days. and so there was a quick overview about us and now i will jump on to your site but before that just wanted to pause on and see if there are any questions.
prospect,no not at this time.
rep,look what i've looked at on your site today was primarily these six areas auto suggest the error tolerance on the site
rep,the contextual relevancy research merchandising and the infrastructure and and these are a few elements that i'll show you with examples on the site today that we might want to look at working on and which can drastically improve the conversions on the site. so the first thing and and these examples are not to criticize anyone's work at you are and it's primarily our findings where we believe there is an area of opportunity. so hope that's okay. so.
prospect,ashish i just want to let you know i wait rachel our brand ambassador and she's going to try to hop on the call as well.
prospect,she might be very interesting so.
rep,sure do you want me to wait for her do you want us to continue.
prospect,no i can no that's okay i can catch her up we've discussed oh just there she is.
rep,is she singed.
prospect,yes it's rachel.
rep,i see her coming online.
prospect,you can continue if you like.
rep,okay so the first thing that i looked at on your site was auto suggest right and why autosuggest because this is the first interaction that the customer is making on the site it's very important that we start guiding them to the right set of products that expose the right set of products that they would be more like able to buy and this can be done in various ways we start exposing the most-searched queries we start exposing the most popular products some of the most popular brands or categories given what's important on in a particular product catalog or on an e-commerce site. what i see here is a very traditional cookiecutter solution you have for search queries you have four products right and if i'm not wrong these products that are also coming up are random right i'm sure you're someone looking for id right and i could have completed that as id car id printers or say id card software's but these products might not be your most popular products right. respective of what the customer would have you know completed this as a query starting with id similarly with say id id badge molar or id badge or id card slot punch might not be the most popular search terms at times right. same thing with the printer it's a printer print as a customer i'm not sure if this would actually clicking on any of these would actually make or add value to my search on this site right and  let me not bore you with these rights let me show you actually a few examples that will give you an understanding in terms of how this can be approved i'm just moving my screen so give me like ten seconds and i'll show you some of the examples here from various different vertices. do you see parts warehouse screen.
rep,so this is parts warehouse they sell vacuum cleaner parts and other home appliance parts online.
rep,this is how their site search used to look like earlier right there two different search boxes one was to search by part and the other one was to search by model because there are two kinds of visitors on this site one would search by part in one would search my model how we came in and said you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so they're now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box and what did they choose the wrong search box altogether right. so we not only built the the product finder for them but what we also did is combined both the search bars and build something like this right . the moment i start typing in bissel on the left hand side i start seeing all the bissell parts on the right hand side or on the models for the bissel and some of the top searches for bissel.
rep,us patriot tactical as a as a company they are doing thirty five million dollars in revenue today.
rep,they are based out of texas they sell military of ariel to the citizens now for them some of the brands and their categories were important and i see even in your case maybe some of the brands and then within them some of the categories might be important you carry your various various different brands and their individual printers or maybe parts for these printers could be the ribbons could be the cleaning kit and. so what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in ni shows me nike the most popular brand on the side start showing me some of the most popular categories within nike that i might be more like able to buy night vision nine line apparel some of the other brands that i would have probably not looked at make similar products like nike some of the top queries starting with ni and then on the right hand side we start showing mean nike boots these feel boots are the most popular products on the site today. not just that say if this week the fourth black boot became more popular and the fourth black boot would go on top and others would come down the order.
rep,express for express as a brand some of the categories and popular products.
rep,within the these categories was more most important right and hence what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in jeans start showing the jeans in various different categories my jeans for men women slim blue legging right not just that maybe say this week gray jeans this is very popular start showing up up gray jeans jean women jeans some of the other jean related categories or queries that would be trending on the site for this particular week or the month or of this particular season we can say and we can tune some of these these elements. and the last one i want to show you and again right i know this is this is not from your your vertical but i wanted to show the breadth of the solution in terms of how customize the autosuggest would be based on each business.
rep,big basket dot  com they're the second largest grcery retailer in apac for them there were two problems.
rep,one they have the repeat visitors and each of these repeat visitor used to buy similar products every grocery run they would buy 15 to 20 same products which you should take 60 to 80 clicks for them to go find the product go to the product page add to cart and then check out. so for them what we built is something like this the moment i start typing in chicken it's not showing me all the options for chicken it's me the quantity the price ability to are say see the delivery options and increase quantity and add to cart right here from such box right. and right hand side starts showing me some of the commonly searched terms some of the popular brands some of the category is for chicken and also allows you to put a banner for this particular category because someone's searching for chicken you can start promoting in your chicken products right here. not just that we added personalization to this meaning if i was buying chicken skinless more often on this site i would start seeing chicken skinless on top if you as a buyer on the site for looking buy chicken full leg more often then you would start seeing chicken leg on top of the search box. so here you will see all these customers are various different verticals right there the customer behavior is different on each site some of the attributes the product catalog attributes that are important for each site are different you understand the user behavior on the site how people buy on the site and then customize this particular piece for each of our e-commerce retailer.
rep,and primally and this is the most and this is the only piece which is highly customized because this is the first interaction that the customer is making on the side and becomes very important to start guiding them right set of or  subsets of your product catalog any any questions if i go ahead.
prospect,no no richel do you have any questions. nothing from for me.
rep,okay cool then level looked at was error tolerance right on the site and why error tolerances important and i wanted to put some statistics here so one of the research says that 25% of all search queries are misspelled on shop by shoppers on ecommerce sites is a very common behavior and there could be various reason people type fast people type or come from smaller screens like mobile phones or tablets right and on the right hand side use what what you'll notice is the half data that it we pull up from express this is a real time data 216 different ways in which jumpsuit was misspelled on their site or 223 different ways that body suit was actually misspelled on their site within a month right. and then for the million ways how alphabet letter can be misspelled on any site but this is something that's that's real data that we were able to pull out from a customer. and it's some of the with some of the traditional search solutions that are out there in the market they the the merchandisers are expected to go look at these reports on a weekly monthly basis and start fixing them. a it's a it's a lot of manual labor to sit and fix these kind of i would say equations of any misspelled queries especially with large catalog sizes and two every time someone makes a mistake and a new mistake spelling mistake the experience at that point in time is lost right the that particular customer was not able to find the product easy looks here are some examples from your site i try to misspelled say printers without a r miska ribbons i interchanged c&s to see what what results i would get again zero results then i tried lanyard i typed u instead of y u being an alphabet right next to y and i on on the keyboard i quickly first u instead of y and to see  if it was to autocorrect at start showing me the results but then again zero results page. for that what we have done is built a technology and algorithm that can automatically correct a search query of up to six words the three alphabets misspelled in each word black leather jacket on express all three words are misspelled with one alphabet missing we not only connected but we also start showing results in real time right here you will see maybe printers what was they were the system was trying to auto correctly to print and not printers but then again it did not show me any products for it right in the other two cases it didn't even autocorrected.
rep,then the next thing i looked at on the side was stemming could be singular plural words could be same words with spaces in between a print head versus print head with a space the intent of the customer does not change they're probably looking for the same product but the experience delivered is is different the number of products that they are seeing 698 versus 455 the number of products are different the order of these products is again totally different. i looked at eddi square printers having eddi square is one of the brand that you have on the site try to look for eddi sqaure with space and without space again with space was a zero result page delivered without the spaces it's really worked well.
prospect,can i ask you a question ashish so so as far as the stemming related issues i know that with our search spring algorithm we do have the capability to go in and add misspellings themselves but if it doesn't recognize a person's search keyword or longtail keywords from the from the current search spring algorithm we can physically and manually add those things to the algorithm does the one does this one are the one that you're proposing have the capabilities to add those misspellings or is it just assumed or is that functionality editable .
rep,so with us that we do that automatically i know search spring expects to do this from the back end we don't expect merchandisers to do this from the back end.
rep,then we do give you the capability to add synonyms at the back end those synonyms are only for very industry specific jargons or words right so to give you an example in the weightlifting world shoes are called lifters right now there is no way that we would know shoes are called lifters in a particular industry for a particular website and it will not make sense for us to add that into our universal corpus because lifters might been something else in a different industry altogether so in those corner cases we'll give you the ability to create synonyms right but not for these kind of commonly known errors right and say print head versus drill head and this thing which is automated printers right some of the spellcheck issues that i showed you these are all automated and this is automated up to say two alphabets misspelled in each word right and up to six words so we can handle 85 to 90% of your queries without you having to do.
prospect,okay and so your solution there is this automate automatic feature and then they end the user in our case you'll also be able to edit and add if we see something missing or something that they don't need right okay.
rep,yes you will have the capability but then that is something that you might want to use very occasionally and some of the corner cases. so one example i will give you right say eddi square pin printers is very popular in your in your industry and there is another abc printer brand that you do not carry today which competes with eddi sqaure right now someone comes and look for an abc printer on the site obviously your sight is not going to show them anything because you do not have that that product correct that brand in that case you might want to go back and then create a synonym and say abc printers anyone searching for abc printers is equal to eddie seccure printers secure sorry eddie secure printers and they will automatically start showing eddi seccure printers right. those are the kind of cases then you might want to go and create synonyms but not for the spelling mistakes are commonly known in english dictionary words right words like say game gaming taken care of center central taken care of plurals could be say knife knives right those kind of complicated plurals all that is automated that complete experience is something that that we take care of. may be this this example right cleanup kit versus cleaning kit again something which is a stemmed word it intend this the same irrespective of how the customer searching and this is something that's automated you don't have to do anything here any any questions hope i was able to answer your questions.
rep,so here is the example from express right t-shirt.
rep,in how many various different ways t-shirt can be i would say searched for t-shirt without the hyphen without the s t-shirts with the hyphen with the s t-shirts without the hyphen or even a commonly known slang right for t-shirts would be tees and then something that we can the system can automatically understand and start delivering same experience irrespective of how the customers search for t-shirts.
rep,and the reason we we are able to this is to write machine learning within the site machine learning on the web right first we do a lot of machine learning on the web and on a day to day basis we crawl the web to understand the kind of synonymous words out there the root words are stemmed words colors if you if you sell a lot of color variances we're also able to understand the color variances red versus a crimson versus garnet versus ruby right you understand that all of them belong to the red color family so that is that is a knowledge that we get from the web. now the second is within the site what what is it that people click on when they when they use certain words what is it that they start looking at on the site and they and the algorithms are able to understand them automatically right that that's the that's where the machine learning comes into picture in terms of understanding user behavior on a particular website and start incorporating that for future uses right every time we see say five clicks made in a particular pattern by users on the site the algorithm will products for right set of results. then what i looked at was the existing site search these page load speeds right so the responses seemed to be much lower than the industry standard the industry standard is somewhere around lesser than 300 milliseconds because google says anything less than 300 300 milliseconds is usually not observed by human eye. on your site across all the four regions in the country the response time was between 900 to 1000 milliseconds which is 300 to 350 percent slower then what in an ideal case it should be. here is an example or a snapshot that we were able to pull up from express on a black friday one of the most busiest day in the year on the site and you'll see across four regions if you were able to deliver searches within the sub 300 milliseconds response time.
prospect,when you.
rep,pardon.
prospect,oh go ahead i'm sorry go ahead.
rep,no you had a question.
prospect,no i'll wait til we end to ask.
rep,okay then the next important thing is the most important piece is the relevancy and before i get into i would want to kind of quickly walk you through the twelve different types of queries so before these started unbxd both the founders spent quite some time doing research on two things one they looked at large catalogs available out there and they crawl the web to see how these catalogs were configuered and. b how people are searching today be it on google be it on an e-commerce site what's the typical behavior we identified these are the only twelve different types or ways that someone can search on an e-commerce site. to give you an example for exact search when i know the exact sku number exact part number that i'm looking for. feature search could be a red dress where red becomes a feature of the product dress thematic search which could be a party dress the party becomes the theme of the product dress slangs or abbreviations could be say on an electronic side i go in the 55 inch led tv right and the instead of inch someone can go and put double quotes out there. natural language query christmas gifts for toddlers now if i was to search this on google you immediately start suggesting am the right set of products right. and that's what the users believe every e-commerce site do and that's where it becomes very important to understand all these twelve different types of queries.
rep,i have taken a few examples not from all 12 different types but i picked up the top four or five from your industry ins and i show you a few examples from those starting with the exact search but before i go and do that i wanted to walk you through something it will help you understand why does does this happen on the site today and how it can be improved.
rep,on any traditional system like searchspring what happens today is a typical text pattern match it's someone looking for saying for an example nike black field boots the system starts looking at the product catalog field the description various different attributes searching for the word nike black field and boots and start showing all the products ultimately maybe they will also start showing nike black field jackets right or maybe say reebok black field boots right now with us what we have built is a contextual search meaning we break this query in a way that system is now able to understand that field boots is a product type black is a color attribute and nike is a brand attribute.
rep,based on each catalogue we give the right to weightages to each of these product catalog attributes right to make then searchable or non searchable and then based on that we are now able to deliver the right set of products which are all nike black field boots not just that you see there are 300 boots right available within the same same search query how do we ensure we show the most converting products on top right so that's again something that's automated with our machine learning with our popularity algorithms that kick in to understand which products are most popular. could be based on the clicks add to carts or even check outs and push the products which are converting the most on top not just that but this can also be the popularity can also be tuned at a geolocation level meaning say there's a particular black field boot which is more popular in new york versus another product which is more popular in la we are able to identify where the user is coming from and which product is more popular in that particular location to we can drill down to their zip code level and basically start showing the products which are more popular in their region this you are of more trending in their location any any questions.
prospect,how do you identify products that are more popular changer do you incorporate the purchasing history from the site or do you look at the competitors would basically are your criteria.
rep,so the we would common implements our analytics on a site right just like google analytics and we will start capturing data at all levels right starting from so per out of data right how many times it is being searched how many times do people click on it add to cart and then check out.
prospect,so that's what it's just basically just your your internal analytics tool right you don't integrate with anything else.
prospect,no okay thanks.
rep,no. but if you if you are using any other any other solutions within this site we can look at integrating into them. so given examples or reviews i know there are third-party tools that that might integrate internal aver and you might be capturing reviews and we can then integrate the reviews piece also within the algorithm to make or to i would say push the products on top based on their reviews right whichever product has more views those go on top. so here a few examples on the site right and this is purely from our understanding in terms of how people would search on on your site look at say polaroid mono ribbons i'm here on the left hand side of the search results looks to mean that we are i would say a lot irrelevant on the right hand side when i navigate this is what i get and i go to a polaroid mono ribbons right and ideally you would want to deliver similar experience someone searching for the same products.
rep,same thing look for data card id printer ribbons again left hand side it actually shows id card printer on the right hand side it understand a with navigation i am able to go and find results. product type query i looked at my fare hid smart cards here you see the first one is actually hid but not from my fare it's from i class it's not even the same brand but it shows up on top. price slot one of the functionality that is at times not not typically i would say look that or consider very seriously and and i'll show you this and this is common with various different sites. looked at photo id i mean camera i get the relevant results in the first fold but i get hundred and seventy-three items you probably do not carry so many cameras now as a as a customer i might be interested to look at the the cheapest photo id camera available on the site and hence i would go and sort it by price low to high the moment i do that i start seeing a lot of products related to cameras sometimes maybe not related to cameras right but not the actual cameras right and this shows that the relevancy is pretty hard coded today what what way it has been set today on the site is that first fold has the relevant results but post the first first fold these products are not relevant . i and hence it will work for certain popular queries but as as soon as someone comes and does a unique query on the site the relevancy will completely break.
rep,here are some examples express blue straight-leg slim fit jeans such a long complicated query  we were able to quickly i would say automatically solve it and start showing the relevant results brown loveseat with cupholder specific very specific query someone looking for a loveseat with the cup holder brown in color able to understand start showing those products. then i looked at feature search on the site i went to pvc cards as a category on the right hand side you see my navigation page i went to the piste cards the category selected the filter 30ml and i got 42 products all of all of the products that probably i was looking for as a customer. now the moment i start searching for the same thing 13 ml pvc cards i get 9 items which may be for the first two are relevant but after that you start seeing irrelevant  the customer is not even exposed to all the pvc cards with 30ml thickness and that you actually carry today on the site. have some examples again from expression that reason i have these examples from expresses because the maximum number of variations in terms of how products can be served is in apparel and hence is the best way for us to show our solution. full sleeve office wear for women and we are able to solve that start showing the relevant results black v-neck for women we are able to understand something looking for women dresses which are black in color v-neck in style start showing those products in the right order. do that non product searches some of these are i would say are optimized probably someone some of these were manually optimized like shipping policy difference policy does work but then the moment i start looking for something else this a payment options you have a dedicated page for that on the site today and i have a snapshot off it on the right-hand side if i was to search for payment options gives me takes me directly to a product page and not the payment options page that you have on the site.
rep,so we can also make your non product content searchable on the site which could be such pages all which could be any other content that you have could be blogs could be articles write any any references that you have on the site we can also make that searchable. there again examples from express returns right various different returns could be the us could be the canada like people that someone you know some of the pages that people might be interested to look at when they are searching for the returns. compatibility search for site like your sometimes this becomes important product a compatible with products b so on the right hand side you see when i go to this particular product idp the long sleeve cleaning cards within the specification it clearly says that this works with the following card printers smart 30s and smart 30 d and hence i wanted to search something by that so thinking that i already have a smart 30s printer i look for cleany cards for smart 30 s starts giving me some of the printers but not i'm the actual product it returned only two products these are the two products that have returned did not show me any cleaning cards. again number from express tops for jeans again we were able to understand someone's looking for tops and not the jeans as a product and start showing those products. theme based search against a winter jackets are expensive suits people for most i would say high-priced suits we start boosting the high price boots on top. natural language query it is very important to understand that these are the queries which will convert at a 60% higher rate than any other queries on the site.
rep,though the volume of these queries can be lower this might stand within single digits any website would have around say 8 to 9 percent of their queries as natural language queries but here the infant of the customer is very clear they are at times also copying this from google or from a competitor site and placing it on your on your on your site and trying to search for a product. in your case look for something like it was a single side printer under dollar 1000 and what i got was totally irrelevant results these were not printers these were not evol is also like random 1775 products that were shown probably you might have one or twoevole single side printers which are less $1000. again an example from express blue dress on sale you were able to understand and start showing blue dresses which are on sale head query search again any any questions i just wanted to pause and see if there are any questions and hope i'm not going too fast. oh so i noticed you had a category page first software and on the
rep,right right hand side i have the snapshot of that that page i click on software i get various different classifications various different software's that i could be interested in and i you also have classification by brand when i search for software the experience is not same that two ways to handle it one is obviously you can always take the users someone looking for something exactly on your category page you can take them to the category page or here is an example . on an electronic side say i was looking for mobile i'm not my intent is not yet clear and i'm looking for mobile mobile headphones cases and covers we the technology that can identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity. not just that but you also immediately starts showing products for the most popular category that being mobiles here you immediately start showing mobile's. but then the customer can still choose between mobile headphones cases headsets right and not only that but say if mobile cases and covers was more popular than headphones then cases and covers would come on position 2 and headphones go on position 3. same thing for outnet we built this as a demo if i was to look for alexander wang who's a designer and in your case it could be a brand light the intent is not clear alexander wang makes a lot of different products could be todes shoulder bags shoes we can start showing these products by alexander wang neatly bucketed into each category on a single page i'm giving the customer and ability to browse through these products horizontally or vertically. facets of filters it's it's good to see that you have various different facets on the field on the site today on your i would say search results  page but one of the things that i notice well they're pretty static right in nature irrespective of what i'm searching for printers or id cards i get a category on top subcategory then maybe printing have the capability printing technology right lamination capable.
rep,very similar order of of these facets right now here are a few examples in terms of how customized the facets layout can be but not only that from a technology perspective we can also make them very dynamic. and i'll explain you this with an example so say on an apparel site shoes versus shirts right they'll have different set of filters on shoes you would want size ankle height width casual shoe type fastening right various different attributes which might not be applicable to shirts. with us we can define that for shoes these are the filters that should show now in respect of how someone searches for shoes could be men's casual shoes shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even look for shoes they might come and say men's nike men's adidas as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category that being showed here the shoes filters would automatically kick in . on the same side if someone was looking for shirts the shirts filters would automatically click in right. that's one level of dynamicness. s now the second one is that within these filters say width became more popular this week people are clicking more often on width as a filter you would want width filter to be on top and that happens again automatically right whatever is your popular filter automatically starts coming on top and me the reason is say for printers the category filter might be very important but for id card maybe the material of maybe the thickness might be more popular or maybe the price might be a more important filter.
rep,and that is that is a filter that you might want to show on top right so you can configure this manually or this can also be automated for the popular filters to come on top. and the last thing is the zero results page every site is going to have zero stage irrespective of how great the search solution is and there could be various reasons for it maybe you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or maybe the search queries so butchers really difficult to understand the intent of the customers. right we believe that the onus is on us to start guiding the customer whenever they encounter a zero results page  and here is an example right on this site you see what we have done is place two different widgets recently viewed and recommendations now recently viewed other other products that that that that particular customer would have looked at in that particular session or in the prior session on the side this gives them the ability to go back in their crawler discovery journey now. based on their affinities towards a brand towards a color towards a price point towards a style we start recommending some of the products that they would be more like able to buy right. and this gives them the ability to move ahead in their products product discovery a journey without maybe returning to the search box or to your navigation menu so that's the search solution any any questions do you like it not like it was this something worth your time.
prospect,question about the basically the slides you're on right now the recommendations that is something that the team you'll need to manually set up correct or do you have other maybe automated solution that you could choose.
rep,so we also have a product recommendation solution which is again automated right which is again on machine learning popularity primarily on four things popularity wisdom of crowd on turn based personalized it's a 10 widget strategy right so with the search what we do is we implement these two widgets just for your zero results pages but if you're interested in a recommendation solution we can also implement 10 different widgets across the site starting from homepage your category pages search results pages add to carts check out at your pdp pages and to primarily upsell or cross-sell products. to primarily upsell or cross-sell products. and this is again something which is automated this is not a hard-coded solution we do give you some controls at the back end so you might want to come in and say for anyone looking for a product from category a i want to start showing them products from category b right but which products will be shown is again something that's automated which is based on the analytics in terms of what people usually buy together what what people usually view together right within the site and and based on that we'd start recommending the products on the site i can show you some examples and then again the ui will be very in sync with your site but then the idea is hand pick just for you maybe we were able to gather information this is a repeat customer we know what they looked at in the past on the home page itself we can start showing some of the products very similar to what amazon does today on their home page. popular items these products could have been popular this today or maybe for the week for the month we can tune the duration the idea is to start showing popular products on the site for first-time visitors on the side who don't know what what they should probably looking at on the site what are the kind of products they should they should probably buy on the on the site right. they start showing some of the popular products pdp page someone looking at this bracelet $65 this particular style color we are able to start recommending the products which are in the same styling which are probably the same color same designers could be at this at some times right you give you some new controls in this could be say someone looking at a $65 obviously you would not want to start recommending products which are $200 and which are say 5 or $10 which is a huge difference but you can come in and define that start showing products which are plus or minus of 10% in price or plus or minus of 20% in the price point. this way you you start showing them products which are maybe within the price range but from a styling perspective and then from a category perspective pretty much is something that's that's automated you will not have to do anything you can you nearly start showing some of the similar products on pdp page.
rep,you would have the algorithm would have understood that 5 out of 10 people buying you'd find also buy filters together we immediately start showing filters as accessories again to primarily upsell or cross-sell for a particular category. another example 5 out of 10 people buying a nail colour might have also might also buy lip color so we immediately start recommending lip colors trying to upsell into a customer who's on the cart page. so this is the recommendation piece of the solution it's separate then the search right the search would have few recommendation widgets like this right  on the zero results pages but then this is totally a different solution all the matter.
prospect,and so the personalized recommendation solution do we need to have the you and the xp search implement to use the personalized recommendation solutions or are they completely independent from each other and can be installed separately we decided not to go with the search.
rep,typically they are completely independent right what the solutions are completely independent but one of um as as a as a company we believe the bottom line right the bottom line is at how much impact you were able to make in terms of the increase in conversions and revenues right and we have seen from our experience in the past when search and recommendations both are implemented together we can come in and guarantee a minimum increase of 10% increase in the conversions within the first 90 days. that typically does not happen only with recommendations with recommendations numbers could be lower but when both turned together the impact is much higher.
prospect,mm-hmm okay sounds great make sense thanks .
rep,yeah so that's the solution beyond this there's there is one more thing that we i know we have another seven or eight minutes but what what we do have is we back end much is a merchandising dashboard right . yeah so that's the solution beyond this there's there is one more thing that we i know we have another seven or eight minutes but what what we do have is we back end much is a merchandising dashboard right . we believe we can deliver 90% experience on the site search and product recommendation side of it automated. but then the remaining 10% control is something we would give back with you many of merchandisers because you know your business does right what other what are the brands that you want to promote what other campaigns you want to run what kind of products you want to boost so those are the kind of controls that we give you back through a merchandising dashboard and and let me quickly show you an example of this just moment you see if i can show you our new dashboard looks like i'm having challenges let me show you one of our new dash board so this is there is a new dashboard that we have we have launched recently and we are moving all our old customers to the new dashboard and all our new customers will also get the new dashboard. but i'll kind of give you a feel in terms of what you can grow from the backend system you see my screen.
rep,okay awesome so this is the this is the dashboard you'll have access to once you are done with the implementation you can manage multiple domains multiple sites right you have five multiple sites if you want to keep single dashboard you can also choose to do that if you have the same merchandising team across these sites.
rep,you'll get a high level understanding what how many products you have was the feed size like and was it last index here are your feeds or product catelog of attributes which we make searchable non-searchable this is for unbxd internally using this tool again have visibility in terms of how the system is configured . here you can set global filters i'll show you how you can set these for each category but these filters are across the site very simple to set filters price and you can come in and say here price the for price create a facet. synonyms again very easy way to create synonyms and this is only four corner cases like the example i gave you lifters i want a bidirectional synonym  or a unidirectional synonym so say shoes create synonym and you're done . now every time someone looking for lifters will automatically start seeing shoes on the site then let me show quickly show you the merchandising merchandising search let me delete some of the old ones the global rules that you see right if other rules that you would want to set which are applicable across site so say always promote a particular brand right across queries do not show out of inventory product or demote out of inventory product any any such rule which is applicable to all your search queries can be set here but let me take an example and show you how you can actually create rules so dress merchandise and this is the demo site actually for which i'm doing showing you the dashboard me show you what do we see today the dress right so we see a blue flower dress red black and another flower dress right some of the top products on the on the website. and i go back onto the dashboard i start seeing the replica of the site and this is a 90 percent experience these are all dresses these are all relevant results based on popularity to your location set but your merchandisers might want to override the technology and they can start doing that by applying various rules starting with filters they can filter the rules based on any particular category right maybe brand anything else that you feel is important for your business you can run promotions you can start sorting boosting slotting. let me show you an example say boost i want to boost a particular brand contains eliza you see all the eliza products are now on top now even within this say i might want this particular product on top.
rep,maybe this is the new product or this is a product which is going out of fashion so i want to push it to the right to the customers so these are the product level placements. and what you can also do is you can start slotting which is a larger set of products you can place at a particular positions so you can say a position 5 to 7 i always want brand contains five six seven now you have the most popular ralph lauren dresses even if this dress goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next popular ralph lauren dress here. popular ralph lauren dresses even if this dress goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next popular ralph lauren dress here. in our new dashboard what capability you have is to set a time line for this one if you can come in and say i want to run this so there we call these as campaigns you can say i want to run this campaign only for next two weeks i want to see how it performs right. dresses a query i will merchandise it in a way and see how how the performance is for next two weeks and what you can also do is you can differentiate between the devices you can create a different page for or rule for people coming from mobile versus people coming from desktop all right so that's an added capability on the new dashboard that we have launched. and then you can have banners so you can insert an image url landing page url or an html here so every time someone searches for dress they also start seeing that banner.
rep,now all of these changes occur on the site in real time you won't have to wait for it next thing these are the eliza dresses there's the other two dresses that we had pin five six seven you see the the ralph lauren dresses that we are slotted any questions.
rep,i also want to show you how you can create landing pages right so say clearance 2017 today we don't have anything on the site under clearance go back clearance 2017 yet rule merchandise we don't see anything because there's nothing on in the catalog right now convert to landing primary run same set of rules plan contains eliza oops something went wrong mankind is elijah you can similarly drag and drop in slot you can add banner to this landing page also right. and now if i was to go back on the site and look for clearance 2017 i start seeing the same set of results as under merchandising dash board. you can now take this url and start using it for any of your email campaigns marketing campaigns seo campaigns right you'll get a much clearer url for your marketing this is just a demo site so kind of matured but you'll get a clear link. so that's the merchandising for search and now category quickly for the category rules so say for sneakers as category in merchandise you can add banner once you add this banner it was figure of how someone searches for sneakers these banners would automatically kick in and these filters would also kick in. so for sneakers you can come and say i want the size filter on top drag and drop i want the color filter on position two i want to hide the cat filter i want to hide the test filter irrespective of how some one searches for sneakers could be just coming in and say nikey as far as 75 products or 75% or more products are from sneakers as a category these filters would starts showing.
prospect,richelie run out of time we appreciate your time i need to hop off i don't know and i rachel if you wanted to stay on or not.
rep,i'm pretty much.
prospect,i think i think i will stay until it ends so julie if you need to hop off go ahead.
rep,but i wont take more than maybe say five minutes and then i can i can see what questions you might have and if you have any next steps the only last piece that i want to
prospect,okay alright thank you.
rep,show here is the reporting. do you use google analytics today for your reporting.
rep,okay cool so with some of the traditional sources like like google analytics right there's a limitation to search reporting and the way google analytics reports search session is that say if i come onto your site search for something first i am not able to find it then i navigate and eventually buy google will still tell you that it was a search conversion and not a navigation conversion because my session started with search so we overcome some of those traditional i would say site search analytics issues with the reporting that we have drilled and what we give you is three levels of reporting one is a very high level reporting in terms of what's your search traffic is what your browse traffic is executive reporting to come and look into how your site such as performing top search query top  products added to cart top click products top zero result queries.
rep,and this is something based on time and you can look at last one month one week one year reports and also download them csv or in excel format from right here with the new dashboard there is a little more detailed reporting in terms of what your per search revenue is what's your total search of anyways what's a total site revenues and some of the more i would say revenue driven statistics. then the next is the query level reporting here you have all the search queries on the site during a particular time frame shows you hits views click-through ctrs conversions and orders for each of your search queries and i click on this query stop up showing the trendline how the query has been performing over a period of time right with regards to the sales how this query is converting with regards to sales and you will also have list of products and that are converting for this particular query what other products which are performing which are not not performing you can come in see it. on the flip side say if you have category managers who come and look at your products or product performance on the database is they can come here look at each of your product on the site today how this product is performing with regard to views in that regard and if i click on it again shows me a trend line the sales trend line for this particular product and the queries for which this particular product shows up and performs for and how it performs for each of these searchs. and again all of these reports can be downloaded into excel and csv formats. so that's the solution.
prospect,okay so one i think maybe last question you mentioned that search is separate from their personalized recommendations and then what about merchandising is it another separate solution or is it part of either one there's a lot both of them .
rep,thats the part of search thats the part of search and for recommendation we will also have the controls for recommendations as a part of them.
prospect,okay sounds good.
rep,so i'm curious to know next steps do you think that could be a possibility for us to do a 90 day poc the wavy engages do a 90 day poc you can run an ab test if you want against our spring if not you can define a baseline how your conversions are today and within those 90 days the idea is for us to show you at least at least 10% increase in conversions right and if we are not able to do that you can walk out at any one point in time and that post 90 days basically you make a decision if it is a solution which you want to use longer term or not.
prospect,how do you run ab searcher.
rep,the a/b test.
prospect,mm-hmm sorry
rep,ab test would typically need to happen at your end if you use any ab testing tools internally i think omiture there are various other testing tools are available out there that customers typically use.
prospect,so basically on our end have to tes the so we do have optimized way that.
rep,optimizes use right so with in optimizing what you can you can do is you can divert an x percentage of traffic to one was and your remaining traffic on search spring today and then start seeing the performance which performs better which and once more right some of our larger customers the way they do is they would put maybe say five percent of their traffic they would not want to risk it at a larger scale during the poc phase until they're confident that some of our smaller and medium customers but the way we do it is we do 50/50 right fifty percent on the competitive side the fifty percent of the traffic coming to unbxd and then we start showing you the conversions. this way you will also have right you'll also have your own metrics will show you conversions based on our analytics and google analytics as well right on both the bases you will be able to see which ones converting better .
prospect,mm-hmm so can you if right now i'm not prepared to say that if you reveal around this test or not i need to think about it process the information so we can follow up on this later but i would really appreciate it if you could send me information in terms of maybe some steps in terms of how this tests are normally implemented my assumption is they don't need to implement the pixel or what do we need to do before we can run this test so if you could send some additional information in terms of complexity how to implement the test and then if there is pricing associated with us if we need to bait people to run this test i'd need to know that as well .
rep,right so it for us to be able to run the test what what we'll have to do is ultimately we'll have to implement the solution so we'll have to implement the solution on your staging site you test it internally first in terms of how these search results are coming up right and then if you want to put the live traffic on unbxd that's when they'll have to start looking at using optimize basically you need to split the traffic that's the idea of using optimizing . but prior to that unbxd has to undergo the complete implementation of site search on the site and so i can send you a quick guide in terms of how how easy our implementation is and then we do the complete implementation work right i would say 90% of the work is done by our team ten percent of the work done it at your end . mostly with regards to testing and some of the accesses like a nivo merchant access and some of the business decisions in terms of designing those auto suggest pieces and stuff. so that's where you would need the help of your team but then complete development work is done at our end designing work is done at our and then we implement the solution on your staging environment and when we are ready to take it to live that's when we would run that through an a/b testing platform something like optimizing then you can decide how much traffic you want to push on on unbxd. and i can send you some more details or an email as well.
rep,so typically what you will have is an implementation fee right during this 90 days that's the only fee that would be i would say monthly fee as well.
rep,this cost would vary so i'm curious if you were to do an a/b test would it be first on idzone or is there any other site that's on top of it that you would want to test it on.
prospect,okay so yes and . my immediate thinking and again i need to think through the information a little more but my immediate thinking is that if we do run the test it probably will be on another site so probably not an idzone but again need to think.
rep,okay because the pricing would also change in terms of how bigger the traffic is right so i'll send you as a an excel right that some of the site metrics that we would require kind of  what the pricing for the poc will it be possible for you to share some of the data and these are very high level data in terms of your catalog size your monthly average monthly visits average monthly search sessions average order value and say conversion rates and we can sign an nda required for you to share that.
prospect,so if you could send me as part of the follow-up in the email though list of everything you would like to get they'll take a look and you'll see what we can send normally and i'm new with the company so i don't know the processes here but from my private previous experience i normally prefer not to send the order level information traffic is mine the order and revenue usually i don't not anything like this but the height of things you'd like.
rep,i completely understand that and i'll tell you the reason that i asked asked you for that and i think that's rachel right you join the column later before i could i could have shown the slide to you because none of us are unique proposition is the increasing conversion in terms of what is the increase in conversion that people we could bring in on the site and here are some of the high-level stats in terms of how we have impacted the conversion rates and the revenue within the first 90 days and some of these we can also at times contractually guarantee you can come in and say when a 90 say 90 days this is the kind of increase that you will see if you don't see you don't pay us and for that at times this data kind of becomes important for us. but it's not sorry i'm okay you share me the other day at all so i can send you the prices.
prospect,okay sounds great so yes tell
rep,sure awesome richard i don't have your email address so.
prospect,anastasia ana and stasia .
rep,i've been talking ana.
prospect,yes and that's
rep,i have yours that's okay i have yours.
prospect,fine .
rep,okay i got that .
prospect,okay great so yes if you could send it to me that would be great and then after i received the email i'll take a look and we can follow up .
prospect,end of this week will be hectic so definitely not end of this week we can maybe touch base quickly early next week i don't guarantee there will be any there's definitely do not be any decision made by end then though.
rep,sure no issues i never.
prospect,ended up go ahead know if it was of right now i'll just i'll take a look at the email they'll basically and you'll go from there.
rep,sure ana where you located at where is the team located primly.
prospect,we are located in minneapolis twin cities area.
rep,okay so if even if you feel as a next step you want we need to present this to a larger group just feel free to let us know i can have myself are going to say my team the available at your office do this in person in a room address everyone out there who should be looking at at the solution like this before before moving ahead so more than happy to do that as well.
prospect,sound good and by the way the a/b testing the a/b test is it possible to run the test for the personalization solution or not really.
rep,for the recommendations you mean.
rep,personilized recommendations so with personalized recommendation i don't think you're doing that with search spring today right.
prospect,yes. sorry can you repeat the question.
rep,ab test what would you want to test it against do you want to test it because i.
prospect,yes right now we don't have it and so i just wanted to basically get an roi not having it right now versus what we have versus having this solution.
rep,okay let me let me see if we can do just recommendations and i'll get back to you on that.
rep,sounds good great thank you and feel free to shoot me an email call me if you have any questions and more than happy to answer.
prospect,thank you
prospect,no problem i have another colleague shannon will be joining us soon.
rep,okay alright alright fantastic he should be joining as as another person on the call or so just wherever you guys are.
prospect,i'll put him on the call will put him to the webex.
rep,gotcha awesome so we'll give it a few minutes and then we'll go from there i heard a beep.
prospect,this is shannon from kirkland.
rep,hi shannon how are you.
prospect,good how are y'all.
rep,i'm doing okay hi my name is monal patel and i'll be the the host today i suppose.
rep,we also have michael on the calls by the way is it michael mike what's the right way to address you.
prospect,i'm easy either way.
rep,whatever you prefer i just want to make sure i say what you want to say.
prospect,go ahead with mike.
rep,mike okay alright awesome alright give me one second mike i just i just set up my account here and i'll just sorry about that. i was telling michael i was just getting off a call and i think they beat me to it i don't know it's chance to totally set okay okay can you guys see my screen.
rep,okay awesome you should be able to see the curtains up kirklands homepage.
prospect,perfect alright.
rep,well mike and shannon first of all thank you so much for giving us the opportunity here really appreciate the chance to talk about talk about our solution and maybe even exchange ideas in terms of what the opportunity might be if there is one. so just to introduce myself my name is monal patel i manage the north america business for unbxd and i also have another gentleman on the call he is our sales person for the for the north america as well. i know michael i like try to look you up online and i see that you are a site search specialist shannon and i didn't know you were joining a call so if you guys can just do a quick intro background for me for my sake i'll really appreciate that.
prospect,sure yeah the point specialist we actually wish that slightly different things that we that we effects on yeah.
rep,so just as a just out of curiosity i know that we had talked to i believe erika couple years ago and you guys were on adobe search and promote if i'm not mistaken at that time is that what you guys still use today. i just was trying to set the context so that i know what platform you guys are on and you know as soon as we get into the conversation i have a little bit more context around it.
prospect,correct yeah we're on  adobe search and promote.
rep,got it perfect and from a sites are specialists i just want to understand do you guys manage adobe search and promote or do you create custom landing pages do you fix any issues that come up with relevancy you know or do guys do more on the seo side of things you know create specific taxonomy pages etc.
prospect,shannon. as far as our search we don't really spend a lot of time like fine-tuning or top keywords or anything like that ever seen come through kind of we don't have the bandwidth at the moment but it's definitely something that you know we always want to continue to optimize and look into so.
rep,got it got it okay no absolutely that makes sense what we wanted to do was i'll give you a little bit of background on who we are i don't know if you had a chance to do any kind of research on us or not but.
prospect,yeah erika actually had passed along i think you guys did a little research for us in the past i just looked at that this week actually but yeah whatever you guys can tell us and help us out with if you have any ideas tell us more about yourself.
rep,yeah absolutely that's fantastic so just to give you a background on who we are we are a product discovery company what we mean by that is that we help ecommerce retailers manage their product discovery on the website. if you think about product discovery from an e-commerce perspective a customer can only discover products on the site in three different ways either through the taxonomy of navigation so if i were to let's say either through your taxonomy and navigation either i use the search box or through product recommendations right. and so unbxd has built a product and a solution for each one for all three of them and we started out seven years ago we started out with site search four years ago we started into product recommendations and two years ago we started to get into the whole navigation and category pages solution as well. and i'll show you different elements of what our philosophy and how we think about it and what is it that we're really trying to solve and where the opportunity might be. okay here's some of our customers we work with almost 1200 site web sites globally are roughly hundred twenty customers and brands right here in the us and we manage tremendous amounts of scale in in where we serve almost hundred and 1 point 5 billion interactions per month.
rep,here's some of our large customers in fashion apparel hardware electronics grocery on improvement so we have a lot of expertise across different verticals within e-commerce and we also work with a lot of different platforms.
rep,actually we are platform agnostic so even if you have a custom platform our solution can work on a custom platform as well.
rep,by the way i wasn't able to find out or do my research to try to see what kind of platform are you guys on is it a custom homegrown or are you guys using one of the other vendor platforms.
prospect,<oh fine it's shout cms a yeah - same>.
rep,in the same for why is that what you said. got it okay got it okay and and you know we have differentiated ourselves in four different ways we have created a technology and a platform solution that provides a foundation of scale because we've solved a lot of problems and i'll walk you through what some of those problems are.
rep,we don't necessarily just give you the solution we understand your business and how customers interact with your business and we try to customize the solution for your business we have tremendous amount of infrastructure scale like i said we serve almost 1 point 5 billion interactions but every single interaction is backed by a sub 300 millisecond sla. and we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery because we know we have a very differentiated product so let me get into what is it that we were able to find in few instances. and i want to get the conversation so started so you guys can tell me where the challenges might be so excuse me the most the biggest challenge that i first found obviously is one of our most mature products is with site search. so let's say if i started to search for say accent chair or accent table okay what i found is if you can see here the autosuggest. which is the or you might call it auto complete auto fill type ahead i don't know how many different ways we could just come back every year somebody else comes up with a new way to call it so we call it auto suggest and but or the type-ahead. and the that is the first interaction a customer has with your website site search experience right and you can see here i starting to search for even let's say your accent chair or table.
rep,you can see these suggestions that are being provided one is accent i don't know what that means so now as a customer i have to choose between to say chair or chairs and here we're in the trouble is is the customer going to look at it and say well should i pick chair or chairs. am i gonna get one chair or i'm gonna get accent chairs am i gonna get one table or tables let's say if it was not accident it was bar accessories you can see bar accessories or accessory. and this is a big challenge to begin with because what a type ahead should do is make it easy for the customer to choose where they really want to go if they already had a specific product in mind make suggestions to those products so they don't have to type the whole thing out. and because you have so many different categories and subcategories think about me walking into a physical store at kirklands physical store now i know the footprints of some of the kirklands stores are small. but if you do still have a lot of these categories and i had a specific idea in mind the first thing i want to do is go to that aisle or that section where those types of products are being sold or are on display. so how do we expose to them categories how do we expose to them exactly even subcategories depending on what they're searching for provide some keyword suggestions to what we might be looking for.
rep,because they might be coming back to search for the same thing to quickly get to that level but also give them some visual interaction and feedback to say you are so on the right path tell us a little bit more of what you're really looking for.
rep,and i think that's where the big opportunity today it looks like from a type-ahead perspective any thoughts on that mike and shannon.
prospect,okay sounds like <>.
rep,okay do you guys hear that could get that feedback from your executive team from customers you know a lot of times we've heard retailers the ceo is gonna come in and say i was searching for wine glasses and suddenly you know they couldn't find wine glasses. and the whole team is now running behind trying to figure out how to figure out why you can't find wine glasses what what seems to be and if you guys have gotten that kind of feedback internally or externally.
prospect,i think more of our feedback has come from our customers having trouble with our search like yeah you <>.
rep,got it is there anything in particular decision or like like you know that okay this is one of my challenges that i've heard from customers a lot they are trying to do this and they can't.
prospect,i think relevancy and just our number one issue that we have maybe we're searching for a table lamp and then we'll show you lamp first and than anything else that has table or lamp is gonna pop up.
rep,got it yep and so how do you if you allow get let's say you do here and said hey table lamps isn't working what do you guys normally do as a process to solve for that.
prospect,that's a great question and myself like like i said earlier you don't have a a person that's really focusing on our search and recommendation right now or really the bandwidth kind of helped us get there.
rep,gotcha so so you do hear this feedback but unfortunately there's other higher priority tasks where somebody cannot just focus on individual queries and try to say how can you start it. got it okay that's fantastic so it is more of an automated piece that you might be more interested in to see is there something more automated that we can have access to that would solve.
prospect,yeah. right what our top queries and power for conversions on those queries and how can we tackle making them better.
rep,perfect alright alright and i think i had found some similar examples i was i think i was looking for pink kids pillows and i know the first we look like kids pillows but then i used i started to get all these types of things where i would get storage and headboard you know. it's like i understand the relevancy perspective that's i think i was looking for dining chairs and i think i accidentally misspelled because i thought maybe in the beginning i was looking for dinner or something and i started looking for dining chairs. and i think i started to get sofas and in accent chairs a lot more accent chairs and here's was an interesting one. this is something so my mom she's obviously getting old not that i tell her that but she just moved in with us and she loves to read on this shiny new ipad she's gotten so she likes to read it in the corner of her family room. and we were just looking for a recliner sofa for her and i was just trying to search for something reading recliner and unfortunately this is the solution this is a results that i get. so i i was trying to go i was gonna ask you guys to say is relevancy going to be a challenge but i'm glad shannon you mention that so what about spellcheck because i think i looked at dining chairs and i misspelled dining obviously is spellcheck also something that you guys see is common not just relevancy in combination.
prospect,honestly i don't pay or i don't monitor like our queries that closely but i would never guess yes if there's an issue like <>.
rep,gotcha got it okay all right make sense alright so let me let me get into the specifics of what we have as a solution now and i'll give you a different set of ideas in terms of what we have how we can make it easy and rather than focusing on fixing a particular problem how we can help you focus on maybe enhancing the business rather than just fixing a solution.
rep,so and i'll also introduce a little bit of the product recommendations although i do see that you guys use something for product recommendations is that is that a correct assumption. because i think i went to one of the pdp pages and i think i saw viewed also viewed bought also bought so i don't know if this is homegrown or you use some sort of an algorithm or a technology or vendor to do that.
prospect,yeah we use adobe.
rep,oh you use you are on adobe shop like yeah nothing wrong with it okay alright so let me get into the specifics of this okay so let me talk about what are the differences and i'll start with site search. and i also want to give you guys a little bit of an idea and maybe you guys can help me understand what you guys do for the category pages possibly because i know that based on the the breadth of the catalogue that you have in terms of a number of categories. a lot of this percentage of the traffic is probably on the category pages while search is smaller percentage the roi and the conversion metrics on search are probably much much higher but still category just does get a lot of your traffic. and we have a very unique way and i want to hear your feedback also when i when i share some ideas with you as to what you guys think so so what is the unbxd big difference that we bring to the table from a site search perspective. so number one is the technology we have solved a lot site search problems that were not solved before i'll show you what those are that helps us create the foundation for scale second is the business we don't just give you a solution and say good luck and you know we're better but good luck and use this you'll have fun with it. we actually come in understand your business try to figure out how customers buy from you why is it important to show certain things why it maybe important to not show certain things that's may be more important and and we will customize the entire solution for your business.
rep,and last is the framework so we don't just necessarily come in and say oh we'll help you in the beginning and then walk away let's say here from now you decide to start selling a brand new category let's i don't think i saw this on your site. but let's say you start selling coffee but maybe you do sell coffee today but maybe you don't sell coffee today and you start selling coffee well how do you structure your site search experience to sell coffee how do we optimize it. so we both strategically and tactically we come up with a playbook we've done this with 1200 customs or 1200 websites in the past and we have a playbook not that we know how to solve every challenge mind you you don't claim to do that at all. but collaboratively we'll be able to figure that out and set you up and configure the experience for that category to be successful from day one okay so let me get into this specifics of each one of them let's start with the technology piece now. i'll walk you through as to why some of the elements of what you're seeing with the search and promote tool why are why is that relevancy not necessarily as optimized as you were expected to be. so let's take a step back in terms of what unbxd does so there's four components that you need to think about for every single query.
rep,one is the semantic relevance and i'll go into detail for each one of them second is the exclusions third is user behavior and boosting and which is what we call is merchandising. so let's say we get into the the semantic relevance piece let's say i'll take a simple example women's white jeans. or if you take the example that we found on kirklands where we saw pink kids pillow right so what is happening with pink kids pillow is you have three options typically. if either it will do pink or kids or pillow to search into the system into the catalogue or it will do pink and kid and pillows. sometimes you'll also have a technique called minimum match called so it will say pink pillows or pink kids or kids pillows etc. and but in even in that instance the challenge is exactly what you see i believe that today a kirklands is probably configuring it to do an and so it must find all the key words in the beginning and then does an or to get more subsequent products.
rep,and that is not necessarily the right way that is more of an outdated technique that used to happen five six seven years ago where queries were much simpler. and the reason for that is all search systems out there today use a algorithm called tf-idf term frequency and inverse document frequency that was developed in the 1970s but is not and it was applicable for documents not necessarily for e-commerce. so to demonstrate the limitation of that by the way i will show you what we mean by this so let me just put this you guys can still see my screen yes.
rep,so let's assume that i search for women's white jeans and i got three jeans and one white top and sometimes the white top will show up because it might say women's white top goes great with jeans okay. and just because those three words exist a tf-idf system will think that this is a good product to actually show in the search results and in the in red are the tf-idf scores for these products. now why does a white top have a higher score than a white jeans is because sorry it's because tf-idf only looks at either the popularity or the rarity score. it does not give you usefulness score so what unbxd is done is to overcome that tf-idf limitation we've built another layer on top of that call relevance gain. so what relevance gain actually does is it creates a context in e-commerce to understand that jeans is the more important keyword then women's and then white okay. so when that happens we will give more weightage and relevance to to jeans okay now this is the first piece so semantically we try to understand and see that these are the products that actually need to be shown and given better weightage.
rep,however that white top will still be in the search results because it still has the word jeans in it even though it may not be contextually relevant to a human to a machine it's still a relevant search result. so what we did was a second component that we apply is called the search results exclusion we trained our algorithm through a product catalog of almost 200 million products to start to understand that jeans is the product white is the colour attribute and women's is the gender attribute okay. because of this it now understood that a white top is not white jeans so we were able to exclude the white top and maybe even push on other jeans that might be below that white top in terms of the ranking. the third thing that we did was understand the user behaviour so we deploy analytics on say kirklands dot com and we track every single click the customer makes on the site whether they're searching or not searching. and based on that we create a user behaviour score now this user behaviour score is actually tracked per query so women's white jeans will have its own score white jeans will have its own score women's jeans will have its own score jeans will have its own score. so every single query will have its own score and we will find what is your best performing product for that query and we'll reorder the results by showing the best performing product up top.
rep,and this is ever changing it's not just one time and done it is constantly doing applying the machine learning techniques to understand how the buying behaviour from customers might change. because you might actually reduce the price on this or you might have a newer product that that is starting to show some trends we want to make sure that we start to show the best performing products in that moment up top. however the fourth component is also important the algorithm may take care of a lot of things from that perspective but sometimes the business also needs a certain certain output that the business may have an expectation to say i have a particular product. very high in inventory i just want to get rid of it and either you put it on sale or clearance but based on the algorithm it might not show up top because it's not the best profile product which is why it's still so much left in inventory. so you have the opportunity to merchandise and boost some of these products so you can boost a product but in typically with say searching promoters from other tools you might in the paths of considered say endeca or some other traditional solutions. the boosting has a big limitation you'll boost a product in a particular you boost a particular product to solve one query what will happen is we don't you don't you won't know you know how much boosting you need to give to make sure that that product shows up top.
rep,so sometimes you end up giving it too much boost for other unrelated query where it's loosely relevant that product will start to show up on top because it is given so much boosting. so we have also solved that side of the problem where you can't you boosting in a particular query or category that product is limited to that particular query or category and not apply to everywhere else. and here's from a very high-level perspective what differences you can find you might have also your i don't know if your it team might have also suggested maybe let's look at solr or elastic search every other single solution has that same limitation. where what you get is that middle box out of the box from them but you don't necessarily get the e-commerce context awareness you don't get the self learning algorithms you don't get the in-scale of infrastructure. because you need to be able to do some real-time data analysis to try to figure out what is it that we need to show to that customer in that real-time. some tools have merchandising capabilities but they are not that easy to use and requires a lot of it intervention as well and we have built very very easy to use merchandising that actually can influence in real time i'll show you some examples of that as well.
rep,any questions so far i know i i sort of ran through that really really quickly.
prospect,i'm good. yeah i'm good also.
rep,any does that make sense in terms of those are the types of components that you guys are looking for an automation to solve the relevancy machine learning to actually help show the better performing products but also want that control to override for any business requirements.
rep,okay got it alright okay so let's get into these specific business components i want to show you let's start with the what it from a business perspective what a customer experience would really look like okay. so let's start with the type-ahead i'm gonna show you some different examples of what this would look like <> and what i want to show you is the versatility of our solution by showing you very different verticals and how the experience has been changed and modified to accommodate such a different business.
rep,so part warehouse they they sell parts for appliances before unbxd they used to have two search boxes because they have two types of customers one who knows what part to buy another who has no idea what part to buy but they know the appliance model or the model of the the equipment that they have. they thought having two search boxes will solve that problem but the challenge was number one you're putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box number two what if they pick the wrong search box and three you can only optimize one search box at a time. so what we did was let's say i'll take this first example to bissel what we did is that we combined both experiences into a singular search box where we said when i show you parts on the left models on the right and some top searches based on what the machine learning will pick up. next is an apparel world express so in this world it's very important to make sure that we visually engage the customer and i think even for the home-decor perspective that's very very important. it's a very visual thing and from a visual merchandising perspective you want to engage the customer right away so here let's say i start to search for say jeans. you can start to see here how we start making suggestions on the different aspects of what jeans would be and when i hover over each one of them i can actually see how the suggestions will change there's two components to this.
rep,one is i'm giving the customer options to very quickly get to where they might want to go because even when express a lot of categories not as many as kirklands. but you want to get them not just to that high level aisle you want them to get to that very narrow category that they will commit to look for give them some free vidual feedback by showing them products popular products for that specific category or subcategory. but also give them some very specific search suggestions in case they have something like that in mind and that's based more on the popularity aspect or some keyword suggestions based on the products that you have. and you can see here one of the important things is how contextually we change the <origin so> for jeans there's win women's jeans and men's jeans and we'll show both right here. now let's say i actually changed this to a dress you can see here for dress there's there are no men's dresses so we're only showing for women it's not a it's not a pre-built fixed format in which we do this. this is the whole component here is completely dynamic now let's see if i start to search for say a dress shirts if i now search for dress shirts against the only men shows up right.
rep,and that's the idea behind creating such an experience that's visually engaging any questions so far mike shannon.
prospect,no not at the moment.
rep,perfect thank you i think you're gonna you guys are gonna love this one even more hopefully so here let me take this out okay so let's say fresh this sorry this is asia-pac website so it's a little bit slower for the us traffic make sure there we go <> okay perfect. so the idea behind grocery was if you look at your past grocery run you buy a tremendous amount of products in a single transaction same thing was true for this customer as well and the challenge was for to buy almost sixteen to twenty products in a single transaction it used to take them sixty clicks. and it should take than sixty to sorry about the messaging here it used to take them sixty clicks. and what we wanted to come in and show was we wanted to figure out a way how how is it that we can not show them not make them go through the experience of where you have to constantly search click and go through each product experience at a single time. so for i'll show you an example what we did was let's say i searched for bread we realized that customers were searching for bread going to the pdp checking the way checking the price changing the quantity and then adding to cart. so we thought to do this forty or sixty times is just insane because you have to take sixty clicks to do this we just brought all four pieces right here in the autocomplete.
rep,so and another layer that we brought to the table was if let's say i buy garlic bread all the time i will show garlic bread up top for me when i search for bread and if let's say mike buys of mike buys dinner rolls all the time when he searches for bread he'll see dinner rolls up top. for also we wanted to make sure that customers don't actually always buy the same products that they normally buy for say events like thanksgiving etc or somebody's coming to dinner we also show some commonly searched terms some popular brands and categories.
rep,and you can see here under popular brands for example we don't necessarily just show brands or categories that match the text that i'm searching for it may be a product within that brand or category and we show that also. it's not just a text pattern match that we're really trying to do here alright any questions so far.
prospect,we are good.
rep,okay alright awesome next is the a user experience base so this is more a combination of technology and user experience what we we're trying to do here i'm searching for say mobile and mobile could mean a lot of things that could mean smart phones headphones cases covers etc. in this customer's case what we wanted to do was guide a customer because it's it's not a race to show products to a customer right it's a race to guide the customer to the right set of products the faster you do that the better that funnel for transaction and conversions would look like. so when you say customer searches for mobile and i think you guys do that too and i don't know whether you guys do that manually or is it dynamic and if it has any machine learning to it but i at least wanted to demonstrate this to you. so i search for mobile and i know that mobile could mean smart phones headphones etc the technology will find these subcategories and show them in the order of popularity. we know that smart phones are most popular and then headphones that's how that's the order it will start to show up in and if mobile screens start to become more popular over time it will start automatically percolate up top as well. another example we have it slightly different ui is here i search for alexander wang and alexander wang makes dresses tote bags etc i want to make sure and maybe i will we start this ui.
rep,let's say alexander wang makes different categories of products tote bags dresses sandals pants etc i want to show all the products but i still want to guide the customer so i'll show tote bags you scroll horizontally you can see all tote bags you scroll vertically and you start seeing all shoulder bags. and this is another way to really combine the technology in the ui to make sure we are guiding the customer right because someone could come in and say i am looking for bedroom furniture now within bedroom you have so many different categories subcategories. how do you just throw everything in front of the customer you actually wants them to be picking out and say oh maybe i want accent furniture maybe i want beds or i want lamps etc right. next is spellcheck and so before i get into spellcheck i know shannon you mentioned that today and you don't actually have the time to look at if customers are making spelling mistakes or not.
rep,but let's say you do find out or let's say if the ceo comes in and said hey i search for wine glasses but i didn't find any results ultimately you found out that it's he misspells glasses with only one s and what would you do what's the activity that you do today to solve that if it does come across your desk.
prospect,sorry we would probably take a look at like our dictionary but yeah like i said we don't spend a lot of time doing that.
rep,got it so when you take a look dictionary you might come in and say oh this glasses with misspelled doesn't exist in here so you add it i'm assuming that's like a synonym library that you might create. got it perfect and i think this is unfortunately the typical limitation of some of those traditional products because unless until you create a synonym for every single permutation and combination of how a word is misspelled if that combination shows up you will not see the right set of results right.
rep,you will see a no results search page and what unboxes done is we have approached this completely from a different perspective we have built three algorithms it combines three distinct algorithms. like learning algorithm that looks as transposing of letters another algorithm that looks at dropping off of letters and a third one that actually looks at neural networks to remember how the suggestions worked out and how how did it play out. we have solved we have tried to solve i won't say we have solved you have tried to solve the spelling check into automatically without having a synonym library so what we do is let's say i search for black leather jacket. first of all will auto correct all three of them without you having to create any kind of library or a dictionary on the back end we it's not like we've created this ginormous permutation combination structure and we automatically just solve that we have actually solved it through an algorithm. and we do three things will auto correct it to say black leather jacket will show all the different options let's say a black leather jacket had two options or three options of alternatives will show option 1 comma 2 comma 3. and the third thing we'll do is if let's say customers the most common one is option 1 we start showing results for option 1 automatically we don't wait for the customer to choose one but if customers over time start to choose option 2 a lot more will automatically switch option 2 to option 1 and start with showing results for that.
rep,so 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box you do not have to create any kind of dictionary entry synonym entry library none of that has to be created 85 90 percent of the time out of the box it will get solved. same thing with stemming wine glass versus wine glasses you again have to create a solve for that you again have to create a synonym library on the back end to say glass and glasses are the same thing. you do not have to do that with unbxd also you do not have to same like spell check no need to create a synonym library on the back end 90 in stemming cases almost 95% of stemmed words are automatically solved out of the box by unbxd hence the word company name became unbxd it's like how much can we do out of the box. okay the third thing is automatic redirection a lot of times what we've noticed is that say customers came to the site and they searched exactly for candles now if i search for candles today it takes me to an actual search results page. but sometimes you might have created a very compelling layout and experience for candles because it's candle season let's say for example and you want customers to actually go to that candle category page. there's two ways to solve that one is if it is a one-off case we do give you the ability to create redirects but if you always wanted to redirect the customer where the search term matches the taxonomy we automatically do that too you do not have to create those rules on the back end will automatically take care of it.
rep,customer map the search term matches the taxonomy you'll get redirected to that category page category or subcategory the next thing i noticed in a lot of cases was no matter what i searched for so let's say i searched here for pillows. here i searched for candles i think i might have searched for some chairs here if you can see the filters on the left are always the same it's categories availability other options price categories availability other options price categories availability other options price. but you also know shannon and mike that customers do use different facets for different categories of products for candles maybe color is extremely important to me maybe price is more important to me maybe the type of candle is more important. maybe the fragrance right totally forgot the fragrance a fragrance is probably the most important thing so what we have built now it's very easy to do that by the way mind you on if i go to where our candles lighting candles if i go to and i'll just open it in a new window. ah look at that type in the first one so on the category pages you if you have the ability to say look we can structurally facet in the order of importance because this is how customers buy and you know that you are only showing candles here. but on search results page i can search for candles a thousand different ways right i could search for flame-less candles i can search for <> candles citrus smell candles whatever right and so thousand different ways so how do you actually figure out.
rep,you cannot manually go in and order the facets for every single query that's manually impossible to do so this is what unbxd has also solved what we have done is we give you the ability to ways one even through data or one if you as a merchant know exactly what you want. to come in and say for example let's the shoes i have shoes for shoes as a category i want to show size first then ankle height then width then shoe type you said at at once it doesn't matter how i search for shoes shoes casual shoes men's shoes men's casual shoes. these filters in that order will automatically show up it doesn't even have to have the word shoes in it it could say men's adidas men's nike and these filters will automatically show up. if you have completely different category called say shirts completely different sets of filters and a different order set it up once it will automatically start showing those filters in that order whenever you search whenever the customer searches for shirts no matter how they search for shirts.
rep,have you guys come across this particular requirement before i just want to do it check to see if this is even important to you guys mike shannon.
prospect,we've taken a look at like filters on our categories because as you were seeing like on tables but taking a look on our search results is definitely i think something that we should probably look into and doing it dynamically would take a lot of work absolutely.
rep,oh absolutely i don't think shannon and i say this it sound a little bit cocky by saying this but it is not possible to do it manually because you know if you even look at just a single category and how many different ways the customer searches for that category.
rep,if you were to set it up manually it would take years before even it won't get done and by the time you'll have new categories to sell so and we've seen that we've seen that even as small a catalogue as express they have only 60000 products.
rep,but with the enough categories that they have they've not been able to do that and they have a very limited set of categories like curved lines so it unfortunately which is what forced us to even come up with the solution. but again it's not important for a lot of them a lot of the week sellers i just wanted to make sure that this is something that really helps you guys okay the next one is variances. and i also wanted to check if this is a challenge or not so let's say today i search for red dress or i might search for red chair etc and you might have that same product in multiple colours i don't know if you guys have a lot of variances or not i don't think i saw a lot of them. i mean you have a lot of products with a lot of colours but i don't know if it's the same product in five different colours i think they're everywhere everything is much unique so i'm not sure if this is applicable or not. but the idea behind this was if i search for a red dress all of these products have a red dress but i'm not seeing the red dress so unbxd solved that problem also by automatically picking out the red image of that dress and to show that instead of any primary image that might have been assigned to that particular product. same thing we've done we've built a library of colour synonyms on the back end we we've created so let's say for example i search for crimson something just because i want to make sure everything matches.
rep,i don't have crimson on my in my catalogue but i have read will automatically start showing red you if you have crimson will show crimson first and then red but if you don't have crimson will automatically show red any questions so far mike shannon.
rep,either i'm doing an amazing job or you guys i've lost you guys somehow somewhere but please don't hesitate to stop me guys okay if you have questions i know and i'm making guys drink from a fire hose but please stop me if you have questions.
rep,okay next is the mobile experiences i'm assuming you your mobile traffic is increasing everyday compared to the previous day every year compared to the previous year that's it that's what we've seen across the industry i'm assuming it's the true for you guys as well.
prospect,yeah sure.
rep,are you this do you guys have a mobile app by any chance.
prospect,kind of.
rep,kind of okay please elaborate mike i just want to understand if there is an opportunity there or not.
prospect,we we don't have an app as such we have spending which is motifs for getting coupons.
rep,ah gotcha so most of the mobile transactions happen on mobile website got it okay and on mobile it becomes even more important and more as from an experience perspective very different to help customers. and especially on mobile let me tell you if i had to figure out to click on new or click on outdoor and then click on outdoor furniture and then click on something customers don't navigate on mobile customers search on mobile. however customers search very differently on mobile than on desktop because i don't have the patience or the capacity to type in three word queries sometimes they might copy/paste certain things. which is why you might see them but a lot of times customs are technically looking to get to that subcategory or to that specific segment that they really want to get to so usually the queries are one words or two words. and they're really trying to get to that specific narrowed focus of scope that's what they might be looking to discover and what we found is that three different things that you want to do. one is even before you start searching you want to start giving you scope suggestions for example you might have specific categories that customers usually do come in and look on mobile more.
rep,so and what's really popular and trending will start to show up that up top if you have some history in terms of what you might have searched for if you before you start typing you move and show you recent searches. so the autocomplete this design is slightly different than what a desktop design would really look like next is from a ui perspective how do we guide and do category refinements within search this is some sort of a ui component. like i search for shoes i now we have shoes in men's women's boy's girl's how do i show those specific blocks but also show products so that i am not forcing the customer down a particular path if they don't want to go down that path. filters again the whole dynamic filter aspect of it completely translates to mobile and we have a mobile specific experience also i mean this is just an example it it can easily look like what your mobile experience looks like. it's just that we enable multi-select with an apply button to optimize for a mobile experience next is zero results page so today you might have a zero results page. and let's say i'll just force that so today what happens is i don't get any search results obviously and but you do show me some recently viewed products right which is fantastic what we believe that you do want to do two things.
rep,when a zero results page happens you know the customer has to restart it so they can't move forward or to go back don't either hit the back button or go back to the category page or something like that. so only helping the customer figure out how to go back by showing them some solutions and reviewed products which is something we also do. but we would also suggest to provide some recommendations so that if they wanted to actually move forward and these recommendations should be based on that their real time behaviour on that site in that session. and so by doing both you give the option to go back or to go forward another element in terms of a user experience piece is let's say i'm looking at these shoes and i really love these shoes what if i wanted to see more of these shoes without creating that pogo effect right. i'm sure you the pogo sick effect where you see customer's going to pdp page come back go into the second one come back we want to make sure that we give them a quick way to identify not just more details about that product but also alternatives. so you guys already have today the adobe recommendations you could easily create an experience and say i'm looking at these shoes can i show some alternatives to that particular shoe next experience same thing on mobile.
rep,especially on mobile you want to show a lot of variety to customers within the first two or three fold if you don't show a lot of variety it becomes a hardship for the customer to actually scroll to a lot of pages just to find variety. and when you show variety if a customer wants to see similarity they can click on about network says more like this opens up in a modal window show alternatives if they like them click them they don't they close it and move on. so that's the that's the product from a site search perspective any questions.
prospect,<great man that is a lot of benefit>.
rep,well thank you i know i'm going over the time a little bit here but i have two more things i will quickly show you and just just save on time i'll show you a just make sure so this is the backend dashboard that currently we have today that you get access to in terms of merchandising. and you would have capability to do a lot of things using the backend dashboard now as you can see i've just opened up all the different screens to just give you an idea of what's possible and what's not but you know you at a high level you get an executive summary. how many queries product use add to cart events products are sold you get your revenue revenue total revenue to revenue by search visit revenue by search query. so this gives you a really good idea of how your search is doing and where you're heading from a trend perspective are you going down are you going up etc next you also get the ability to look at merchandising. and i'll quickly show you a video it's just for sake of time and how how that merchandising would work so here from a merchandising perspective and and this is something where i want to introduce the whole category pages concept also.
rep,and shannon just a quick question i know you said you spend some optimization and time on category pages do you also use adobe for that or is there something else that you guys use for that.
prospect,adobe.
rep,adobe for that as well got it and so what we wanted to introduce from that perspective is a concept of campaigns right. so when you are talking about looking at it from a from a customer perspective or from a campaign perspective you can define a campaign for either category page or a query you can define start date time end date time and then what we believe is something very unique to unbxd. where you can start in getting enter segments so there's two components there's a lot of conversation about personalization and one-to-one personalization now when you look at the true data of one-to-one personalization. no matter how much you try to figure that out the number of customers that's going to impact at a max it is going to be about 15 percent you cannot personalize 100% of the customers experience one-to-one personalized 100% of the customers experience. you can only do that for up to 50 percent of the customers for that remaining 50 to 60 percent your bottom 30 percent are never gonna buy from you we all know that but that's true for any e-commerce site. but then middle 50% there's an opportunity to move the needle but we don't know enough about them to actually do a one-to-one personalization so we believe the concept of segmenting and targeting becomes extremely important.
rep,and what we've introduced is it is a idea where a capability where you can now segment by user type so you can say i have new versus repeat users i have i can do it by device type i can do it by geography. because the customers who buy say outdoor furniture maybe customers in the northern belt of america buy very differently than the southern belt and maybe the products actually are going to be slightly different for different weather conditions. and i can also do it by a particular channel so i can define and say customers who are coming from the email channel or social media or your ppc campaigns may have a very different buying behaviour. and you can define a segment and an experience for that particular customers and another layer on top of that usually what we have found is that a lot of merchants and marketing team have multiple ideas. for sale category so let's say if you have the outdoor furniture category which you will guys will now start to sort of promote a lot you might want to promote you might have two different ideas promote that you can easily create an a/b testing within this segment within the tool. and say 30 percent of the traffic will go to send idea a 30% to idea b and then let 40 percent be done through the algorithm and let's see who really creates a better conversion or whatever the winning conversation decision may be either you by just by the click rates and conversion rates etc right.
rep,and then you get into the whole merchandising components you get the ability to do boosting and you can boost by any attribute that you send us in the catalogue margins titles attributes availability etc inventory doesn't matter how you want to boost your own products price for example. you can also do slotting and <> so slotting is a concept where you might come in and say you know what my best category page is outdoor furniture and let me just open that up real quick so let's say i have outdoor furniture seating let's outdoor seating is your one of the most new categories. so now between the first fold you want to make sure and show maybe two bestsellers maybe one product that is high in inventory maybe to new arrivals and maybe one which has very high margin or something unique that you want to you want to showcase. and you are able to now define those so now let's say you defined and said let two bestsellers the algorithm will figure that out now for this particular blog i want to show high inventory product. now let's say the rule is show me a product that is in inventory higher than 50% for example as soon as that inventory goes below 50% the system will automatically find another product within this category that has higher than 50% inventory and start to show that here. if let's say you have some high margin products in position five four and five and those products go out of inventory the next two products which have higher margin will start to show up automatically.
rep,so you can create continue to create that experience and not have to worry about if products change inventories change etc you can also do pinning you can do specific products find a specific product and say i have this particular product i want to show up in a regular position. you can do that as well i'll just quickly skip over there we go so if you go to pinning you can either find this and find the particular product by anything saying by item id by sku by description whatever and you can define and say this i want this particular product in this position. and you can pin that particular product drag and drop easily and show that and then you basically publish it and as soon as you publish it based on the day time either it becomes available in a real time or it will be scheduled for the day and time that you wanted to actually go live. and this is available both for search and category pages and or i should say any questions alright.
prospect,<apache yeah yeah no thank you> very much for your time thank you.
rep,absolutely is there i can certainly send that to you and we can do a much deeper analysis of the website also for your <>.
rep,and i really quickly share my screen i have a presentation that i actually put up for this call and before i do that charles you know quickly wanted to understand a little more about rc hobby. more about your business and if there is anything in specific that you're looking to solve today around site search so that i can focus more on those areas which you believe would be important for you today.
prospect,okay sure have you taken a moment to look at our website.
rep,yes i did i've done some research i have taken out some examples as well and i'll walk you through that.
prospect,okay great so yeah basically i mean well you get so we're an online retailer we've been in business in houston for over 25 years and we're looking at improving the site search functionality.
rep,okay and charles are you are you one of the owners of the company.
rep,okay awesome great and i see that your site is on big commerce today curious what do you use for search is that the inbuilt functionality of big commerce or something that he built in the house.
prospect,it's what exists now is is out of the box big big commerce package.
rep,big commerce okay got that and also curious what what how big is a broad catalogue today is it say five thousand products ten thousand products an approximate number in terms of how big is the catalogue.
prospect,we have 21000 products and we have probably another thirty thousand products coming in.
rep,okay awesome so we're looking at around say 50000 products.
rep,okay and is your site new or how long have you been doing online business.
prospect,it's new it's one month old.
rep,i thought so okay it makes sense now because i i when i was doing research i could make out that you you do have a huge catalogue up there. and lot of products that you carry today but somehow your alexa rank seemed to be very low which was kind of surprising and you know difficult to understand the relation out there.
prospect,yeah we did we just put we just put thirteen thousand products up this week so like i told the website we just started this project a month ago five weeks ago.
rep,okay awesome so let me <>.
prospect,what is the alexa rank dear.
rep,so the alexa rank is typically gives its i would say a ranking for the popularity of the site right so i would say google or amazon would be number one on alexa right it depends on in terms of what what kind of traffic you have what kind of unique visitors based on that they start ranking the site.
rep,so it it primarily gives you the popularity of the site and how popular the site is.
prospect,and then and in that fall based on what data.
rep,so alexa looks at a lot of data rates starting from from your traffic to your visitors unique visitors from which country they are coming what kind of visitors are they and based on that they have the ranking system.
rep,so alexa is a third party but is a very reliable company in terms of looking at ranking right there are a lot of other companies also who rank sites popularity but then i would say the standards are mostly on on alexa.
rep,quickly i'll show you that so the way i would look at site would be say <>  r c hobby dot com can you see my screen. okay so there's a small plug in right and it shows me 3 point 3 million alexa rank which means it's a very high alexa rank it should actually be low so say if i was to look at amazon dot com ranking would be say number nine.
prospect,yeah. oh wow okay.
rep,and the traffic rank in us is actually four.
prospect,overlooked by traffic  typically by traffic.
rep,typically by traffic so we typically evaluate sites right on very high level while trying to understand what kind of traffic they would have and looking at your catalogue we you know having such a huge catalogue. this number was somehow you know i was on it not ready to digest i was like no not something that's possible and now it completely makes sense giving your site is just very new this is something that will surely change drastically.
prospect,okay okay great.
rep,so yeah i have a presentation that i put up and i have a very very you know quick agenda for today.
rep,i want to talk a little talking who we are and the search issues that we solve today i did some research on the site tried to find a few areas of opportunities where we can come in and start helping you. in terms of improving the product discovery overall on the site and after that we can discuss any other i would say any other questions you might have could be the next steps you know the pricing implementation process or any other questions you might have.
rep,does that sound good.
prospect,alright great.
rep,cool so to quickly talk about us we are around 6 years old company headquartered at mountain view california we have offices back in chicago and in india as well. we work with over 1200 sites globally 120 plus customers right here in the us we serve or 1 point 5 billion interactions a month and these are the search interactions. and to give you a reference 1 point 5 billion is larger than the top three e-commerce retailers put together in the us. from a from a customers and and i would say from a vertical perspective you'll see we have customer starting from startups to i'll say midsize organization and enterprises that we work with today.
rep,from fashion say express rue21 some of the large names out there hardware or b2b ib supply is a huge hardware b2b supplier they are based out of milwaukee. us auto parts has one of the largest auto parts catalog they have over 100 million products because they're one of the largest online auto part retailer in the us. hh gregg freshdirect again large grocery retailer on the north eastern side of the country. ashley furniture home store one of the largest furniture home store in the country and a very complex catalogue they have different products for different geo-location with different kind of pricing right.
rep,so we'll see that also today from a platform perspective you are on big commerce we have quite a few customers are on big commerce but irrespective of that right our solution can integrate into any e-commerce platform. even in future if you plan to change your e-commerce platform you don't have to change unbxd because we can fit into say big commerce magento atg hybris or even a homegrown e-commerce platform. there is no limitation to what kind of e-commerce platform we can integrate with.
rep,i'm sure you understand the importance of search but one of the most important thing that i want to highlight here is that 80% of your visitors will leave the site after having a poor search experience. they are not able to find or search for what they are looking for they believes that you do not carry it right these these retailers are so habitual of searching for things or products today on google and amazon and getting the most relevant reserves that they believe that that if your site is not showing them the right set of results you do not carry. they might not go and browse and navigate it on the site and that's where the relevant search experience becomes very important.
rep,like i said the  quick quote from from david the ceo at express this was right three months after we went live.
rep,with them he actually quoted us during the q2 earnings call because of the impact in conversion that that we could bring in within the 90 days of of going live.
rep,and that's that's one of our usp right we actually guarantee an increase in conversion which in your case giving you a guarantee could be a little difficult. because we do not have a baseline we do not know what your actual search conversions today are right but say if your site was one year old two years old and you had spent enough time on search we could have a baseline right.
rep,you might come and say we have 5% search search conversions right and that's where we can we contractually guarantee customers saying that we will take it up by say 10% or by 15% right. and here are some numbers from from our customers these are typically within the first 90 to 120 days in terms of what kind of increase they've seen in conversions right.
rep,furniture and home decor this is this is actually ashley furniture home store right 60% increase in their conversion rate 30% increase in their.
prospect,revenue.
rep,big-commerce this is i'll show you this site the fashion site i this is something on big commerce they are called us patriot tactical. again 13% increase in conversion to 10% increase in revenue.
rep,so anywhere average if i was to look at the averages typically i would say 24% 26% is what we deliver across board. but then there are customers who have very poor search the numbers can be really higher customers who have a very good search platform already there the numbers are on the lower side of say 10-12-14 percent.
rep,and that's what we minimally we give the minimum guarantee for them right.
rep,here is the experience that we were able to deliver for express before unbxd after unbxd a simple query like blue jeans you see a lot of products which have blue in colour made of jeans but not blue jeans actually.
rep,and and the three elements of our solution are machine learning personalization and contextual search that help us deliver. not only the relevant results but also start showing products which are more probable to convert and i'll talk about all three elements.
prospect,yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but i want ask you so you know activities buzzwords machine learning anything but from what i've seen so far it looks like all of this all of these type of products the search functionality products require a lot of a lot of database work. a lot of work in the in the with custom fields does this require a lot of back end custom field work as well or does this pick it up and do it itself and suggest custom fields.
rep,so this is how we look at it right the way we've build the system it can read so a lot of our our retailers what happens is they don't have a structured catalogue and if they don't have the right attributes for all of their products.
prospect,yeah that's where we have a problem but we have a lot of products.
rep,right so what we do is we start making the the description readable right and they are able to read description and i would say start using that information intelligence right. if you if you do attribution right it only i would say helps you improve the relevancy to a further extent but that's still not a limitation for us. we can make the description readable searchable right and we can also start searching based on that and improve your current relevancy.
rep,right so if you have attributes it's good right but not a must-have.
rep,so i will now quickly walk you through a few search cases and what i went what i've done is i have taken some examples from your site to relate it you know i would say more to your business in terms of what are the challenges that we see on your site and how we can come in and and help you there. and this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end but just for us to kind of create a baseline and the areas that i like that were auto suggest error tolerance contextual relevancy search ui the back end merchandising which i can talk about and the overall infrastructure. so the first thing that i looked at was auto suggests that so your search box is the first place where the customer starts interacting with your site right and it's important that we start guiding them to the right set of products to the right set of categories that they would be more like able to buy. in your case i noticed that there is no auto suggest today right there is not even a text autosuggest but it should not be only text-based but it should also be a visual.
rep,and i'll show you few examples actually i'll not bore you with these slides and let me show you a few of our customer examples so you'll get a good i will say context on what i'm talking about.
rep,let me show this old site of parts warehouse so parts warehouse they actually sell i would say home appliance parts right and the kind of users they that visit this site they search in two ways. one either by the part number or by the model name or the model number of the appliance that they have and then they start looking for the parts right. and before we came in they used to actually have two different search boxes for these two different kind of visitors on the site. one to search by the part number and one by the model number we came in and this i could <> this is how it used to look like search by part and this was search by model and this is an old version of on their site.
prospect,okay. okay i see.
rep,and this is how it looks today now the moment i start typing in this cell you see on the left hand side it starts showing all the parts for this cell on the right hand side it starts showing all the models for this cell and some of the top searches for the cell. us patriot tactical this is a thirty five million dollar company they sell military apparel to the citizens out there and for them some other brands and some of the categories within these brands was was very important.
rep,and for them what we designed is something like this the moment i start typing in say ni start showing me nike the most popular brand on the site and some of the popular categories within nike. nite ize night vision apparel some of the other brands that i would have probably not looked at and some of the other categories within these each brand some of the top queries starting with ni. and then on the right-hand side it starts showing me some of the popular products typically nike being more popular start showing me nike boots again nike boots are the most popular products on their site. also this is something which is very dynamic in nature right so say this week the fourth black boot became more popular then you will start seeing this black boot on top and the others will come down the order.
prospect,so that all that all the ranking is customer driven.
rep,yes this is this is driven by the way we tune it is we give weightages to clicks add to carts and obviously checkouts right based on that we'll start defining the the popularity of the products.
rep,then another example is express the moment i start typing in jeans start showing me jeans in various different categories and when i hold my mouse over these categories it also start showing some of the popular products within each of these categories. again say gray jeans is more popular today or this week maybe next week blue jeans becomes more popular or red jeans becomes more popular that start showing up here. some of the other jeans related categories or queries that are popular on their site for express as a brand for them some of the categories and the popular products within these categories is what is more important.
rep,and actually <>.
prospect,and those images so when this populate is where are those images stored is it on is it on my server or is this an ajax application that runs from your server.
rep,this is an ajax application that we are running.
rep,and all our complete implementation is typically based on in page ajax we can do a an api based integration also but we do that typically after three or six months of usage. because we do a 90 to 120 days of poc with most of our customers and post to the poc if they really want to continue with us if they see value then we invest our time and customer's time in doing a back-end api based implementation.
rep,but today if you are looking at express even today they are on in page ajax they have yet not moved to an api based integration it's been almost closed to a year.
rep,and because the efficiency is very high on ajax and they're they're completely fine but we have the ability to implement via api also and then the last example <>.
prospect,<> faster being on ajax there's an increased speed at time the api close it down or <>.
rep,no the only advantage i wouldn't even say actually the advantage but what happens is at times some of these large enterprises they have multiple teams working on the site and they want more control control internally right on some of these elements.
rep,that's where they would come in and ask for an api integration no extra <> we we started it couple of months ago but then it's a lot more effort from their team to start doing an api implementation than from our side right. so it's a much longer process so in the meantime they'll continue to use us on an in page ajax from from a response time perspective we have an sla on the contract we maintain a sub 300 milliseconds sla or response time sla.
rep,yeah so the last example i want to show big basket dot com i know not from your vertical but again wanted to show the the breadth of the solution right. basket dot comm is a is the second largest grocery retailer in apac now with them they had two challenges one that had repeat visitors and two these repeat visitors were buying 15 to 20 products in each transaction. which means it would take 60 to 80 clicks for them to buy these 15 products to go and search go to the product page add to cart and then checkout and hence what we built for them is something like this. the moment i start typing in say chicken start showing me all the chicken items gives me the quantity the price shows me the delivery options i have the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from the search box.
rep,on the right hand side start showing you some of the commonly searched terms for chickens some of the popular brands and other categories.
prospect,so this is all customizable as far as what kind of actions i want to put into the search results we can customize all of these.
rep,absolutely. because see add to cart is something which is important for big basket dot com but might not be important for express right.
rep,express no one is going to add to cart a jeans right here from the search box right they would want to explore more products so in apparel that might not work but then b2b businesses and grocery retailers and this is something that really helps people know exactly what they want.
rep,and that's where it adds value so we understand every retailer's business we understand how customers buying on your site and then we customize this particular piece right. we have the technology but with regards to the ui with regards to what elements we should put here is something which is always very specific to each customer.
rep,not just add on big basket dot com what we have also done is added personalization to it meaning if i am buying chicken drumsticks more often on this site i start seeing chicken drumsticks on top but if you are buying chickens skinless more often on the site you would start seeing chicken skinless on top right.
rep,so here the popularity weightage is less right it's not important if say chicken boneless breasts is more popular this week what is important it is you as a buyer or as a as a as a customer on the site you always buy chicken drumsticks. so we should start showing you chicken drumsticks on top and not chicken boneless breasts right.
prospect,and that's based on what the cookie <>.
rep,yeah that's based on cookie if the sites have log in then we can also do <>.
prospect,can you hear me.
rep,yeah i can hear you know i think i lost you for few seconds.
prospect,okay yeah i can hear you.
rep,yeah okay awesome let me go back to my screen this is just the first piece of the solution right and and the importance of this is that the first interaction customer is making <us> you start guiding the customer. you take start taking them to the right set of products right set of categories right something they would be more like to buy then the next important thing is the error tolerance on the site. and i want to put this data here to kind of explain you the importance of this today the retailer's today tend to make mistakes when they type or when they search. and there could be various reasons they are typing fast they are typing or using a smaller screen coming from mobile phones coming from tablets.
rep,and here what you're seeing is say 25% of all search queries today on e-commerce sites are misspelled and this is the actual data across our customer sites.
rep,on the right-hand side we've pulled up is from express this is the real data from express jumpsuit was misspelled in 216 ways it's an it's a nine alphabet or eight alphabet word and it is misspelled 216 times. and similarly say bodysuit is actually misspelled in 223 ways different ways on express right.
rep,and most of the traditional search solution expect you to look at this data and start fixing this manually so now think of say 50000 products on your site each product has say 10 i would say important attributes or important words in their description or in the title right. if you are expected to fix these it's a never-ending job correct and also even if you fix that it is this going to happen after a particular customer had a bad experience on the on the site and did not convert. what i looked at on your sites yeah i try to make a few mistakes again cameras without the e hoodie without an o all batteries i interchange i and e to see how how the site was reacting or what kind of results were being shown in all these cases i got a zero results page.
rep,here is an example from express black leather jacket all three words were misspelled they have one alphabet missing and we were able to not only solve it but we immediately also start showing results in real-time.
rep,the algorithm that we have built is able to automatically correct 85 to 90% of your misspelled queries right and a search query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word can be auto corrected right without you having to do anything.
rep,similarly stemming battery versus batteries you see the experience is totally different right the intent of the customer does not change whether they type battery or the type batteries right singular plural. i saw one of the product on your site fuel tubing versus fuel tube you call it as fuel tubing as a customer i might come and call it as fuel tube again the intent of the customer is not changing. but the experience is different the search results are not relevant so again all of these words typically the singular plural words like game gaming center central.
rep,even in plurals some of the complex plural say knife versus knives we automatically handle this you do not have to do anything we have a universal corpus that we maintain across our customers so this way the customers do not have to do say redirects or create synonyms at the back end for these words.
rep,here's an example from express tshirt tshirts t-shirts with the - without the - or even a slang for t-shirts which is tees very commonly used in a on apparel site.
rep,we were able to solve and start showing the same set of results irrespective of how the customer searching for t-shirt and the way we and the way we this is so one of the examples where we start using machine learning. the machine learning happens at two levels one is within your site right so say the first time just for an example say the first time the system is not able to understand tees right. it is able to understand that every time someone is looking for tees they actually starts looking for t-shirts right and say in different cases like it can be from starting from two clicks to ten clicks. we start gathering data for various different elements but say we we see a behaviour that every three three times when someone look for tees they start buying t-shirts.
rep,it is automatically able to understand then the fourth time that these actually mean t-shirts and start showing t-shirts or start showing starts boosting up t-shirts on the search results page right. that's the first level of machine learning that happens within your site and then the second thing is we you know regularly update our algorithms and our universal corpus basically by crawling the web right. in terms of what's trending out there what people are searching for what other kind kind of stop words what are the kind of stem or root words what are the kind of colours right we also have an inbuilt colour synonyms. if it is important to you we are automatically able to understand any variance of of colours right say you have a red colour canopy but i come and look for a crimson colour canopy.
rep,the system is able to understand the crimson is from the red color family much more closer to to read and immediately starts showing red color products and not blue or black when someone is looking for crimson.
rep,then the infrastructure i i noticed that it's some parts of of the contrary the search response pages are pretty slow typically on the west coast around 846 milliseconds. this is supposedly on these these standards the industry standards are 300 milliseconds this comes from google wherein they say that anything lesser than 300 milliseconds it's usually not observed by human eyes right. and that's why this whole industry standard of 300 milliseconds so we also contractually guarantee our search responses to be delivered in sub 300 milliseconds.
rep,this is a snapshot from express one of the most busiest day that was black friday and you will see across the country we were able to deliver the search results pages within 300 milliseconds.
rep,now the next thing that i want to show you is the relevancy piece right the twelve different types of queries what we have spoken so far is officer there's stemming synonyms right.
rep,now the most important piece to product discovery is the relevancy and we start understanding the intent of the customer and the way a customer can search on your site are typically 12 different types. and and there can't be a search query outside of these twelve train types of queries to give you an example an exact search when i act up when i know the exact part numbers sku number or the model name of the product that i'm looking for. a feature search could be red dresses where red becomes a feature of the product dresses thematic search could be party dresses where party becomes the theme of the product dresses. slang or abbreviations wherein on an on an electronics site i start looking for a 55 inch tv and instead of i n ch i put double quotes out there or say natural language queries christmas gifts for toddlers.
rep,now there is no product that has been specified in this query but if we if we type this on google or amazon they will immediately start showing the relevant products which are which can be gifted to toddlers on christmas right. and this is the exact behaviour that the e-commerce buyers today have and they believe that every site search would work in a similar way and that's where it becomes very important to understand the intent of the customer. now the the way the traditional systems do search today is a typical text pattern match so say if  i was looking for a brown leather jacket on an apparel site. the traditional sites what they will do is they will go in search for the word brown the word leather and the word jacket and they will start or-ing it or and-ing it in terms of or-ing they will start showing all the products that has either black.
rep,sorry either brown or leather or jacket in the product catalogue attribute eventually showing brown leather shoes are brown leather belts as well.
rep,as <solar> we also get a lot of irrelevant results sometimes they start doing and-ing then they will say brown and leather and jacket so if you have all three words they will show the product. if you do not have all three words they will not show any product right they will not show a black leather jacket when you do not have a brown leather jacket now this again limits the number of set up a number of products on the site and not the best way to do search. now with us what we do is a more of a contextual search what we do is we break every search query alright so say to give you an example nike black field boots. so we break this into in a in a way that the system is now able to understand that nike is a brand black is a colour attribute and field boots is the product type right.
rep,and then based on your catalogue what we do is we start giving weightages to each of these attributes. on some site say brand would be more more important whereas for some other site brand might not be as important right. so right weightages are given to each of these words and then we start showing the search results pane in a way that it will only start showing a nike black field boots and not say a nike black belt just for an example. now we take it to the next level by our popularity right so say you might have there are say 300 boots on the site which are which fall under the nike field boots category.
rep,how how do you ensure what you want to show in the first fold because typically again more than i would say sixty percent of your visitors will not go across the the first fold on a search results page right. whatever they see on the first fold is the most important set of results or more likeable to buy. so now here these set these i would say products are again based on popularity if this week this boot is more popular they start showing on top right sometimes you can override it through our merchandising dashboard and you can say that the first two products should always be my new products right. we can tune the system and we will give you the control the back end control also to do this and i'll i can maybe walk you through today or maybe on our next discussion through our back-end dashboard as well.
rep,but then again in simple words the system will take care of it and we'll i will say arrange the products the based on popularity obviously these are relevant products but then again based on popularity. primarily to show the products on top which would be more likeable to convert right now i try to do some some relevancy examples on your site tried to say search for some of the exact queries like traxxas batteries. i know you have traxxas as a brand on the site and i wanted to look for say batteries for traxxas by traxxas brand see some of these are not even batteries right. they might be like accessories or parts for batteries but not actual batteries i think only this is a battery this is a battery you do have a few more traxxas batteries on the site.
rep,but on the first fold you'll see a lot of a lot of these products are not relevant then i look for quadcopters i could i could see a lot of quadcopters i think you had one category multirotors or somewhere i was able to see a lot of quadcopters. but when i do this i again get a lot of non relevant results here this is important the first two images are broken right you would not want to show products without images on the first fold. then i look for rc boat one of the categories that you have on the site when i go to that category page of rc boats i find really nice looking rc boats out there but when i search for it again gives you a lot of you know various different products which are surely not relevant.
rep,again servos what was important here was the servos still gave me some some sort of you know i would say partially relevant results.
rep,but as a customer what i wanted to do was maybe say find the cheapest servos on the site and that's why i wanted to sort by prices and on the right hand side you have a price sort filter out there. so i wanted to do that and start sorting the results to find the cheapest servo now if you have 800 results and if i was to sort this and these products are not servos not relevant. and as a customer it becomes very difficult for me to find the cheapest or the most expensive product in that particular search results right and that's where this particular element on the site starts losing its importance right or its usability.
rep,when you do not have relevant set of results here this kind of is of no use to have on a search results page.
prospect,yeah you are right this is all very good to have.
rep,okay i know we have like  10 minutes do we have a hard stop or would you have say 10 or 15 minutes over the scheduled time.
prospect,how much longer we are looking at.
rep,i would say no go ahead.
prospect,no no like what i am saying is i would like to continue how much longer do you think this presentation will be.
rep,it would take another say 20 minutes.
prospect,ok can we can we take a little three minute break and i'll put you on hold for one second i'll be right back.
prospect,ok give me one moment.
prospect,but but i do want to end i would like to see how the backend functions as well at the end.
rep,i can surely do that.
prospect,i'll be right back.
rep,sure charles let me know once you're back.
prospect,okay you there.
rep,yes charles.
rep,awesome you can still see my screen right.
rep,okay fine great so here are some examples of how we were able to solve the exact or product type search queries on express and on ashley furniture stores say brown loveseat with cupholder right.
rep,the complex query like that we were able to again solve and start showing the results feature type search and i look for 2 channel receiver i assumed that 2ch on the this product actually means 2channel products receiver because you had a 2channel receiver 6channel receivers. so i tried to find 2channel receiver again got a lot of irrelevant results not the right product that i was probably looking at again a feature search could be say something like a metal header from the car. the first two are not even headers they are again some parts for headers.
rep,so again <> you start prioritizing headers on top if it is important for your business to start showing some of these parts you you can show them in down the order. and there are various different ways it can be approached and i'll show you that as well when we are not basically when the when the intent of the customer is not clear how do you handle those kind of queries and i'll i'll show that.
rep,here again examples from express black v-neck for women and the reason i have express examples here is because apparel has the most complex relevancy in terms of <> various different ways that people can search for products right.
prospect,yeah i know that fact.
rep,and that's why we always typically use examples from the apparel so full sleeve office wear for women again we were able to solve it or say black v-neck for women v-neck would be say the style of the of the top or of the dress and then black is the colour and for women which are showing the right results right. non-products search is i'm not sure if you have these pages on the site or not but say if you have non product search pages like return policies exchange policies delivery policy or the the options. at times people also have a lot of contents on the site if you have blogs or you have articles on the site we can also make that searchable as part of this single search experience.
rep,here again an example from express in terms of returns say how we were able to show various different options that customers might be interested in when they are looking for returns or a return policy on the site.
rep,same way we can solve various different other kinds of types of queries as well as say compatibly search product a compatible with product b right say tops for jeans we can solve those kind of queries theme-based winter jackets expensive suits for men right. i would say i would say fun rc's would be some sort of theme out there or racing rc's we can again start understanding intent of the customer and start showing that. expensive suits for men we know that someone is looking for products which have a higher in price we start boosting the products which are which are more expensive on the site on top.
prospect,this type of functionality it gets better over time based on how does how does the back end build these relationships.
rep,so that's where machine learning comes into picture right machine learning only gets better it's not something that we come in where the 90 days will show you an impact on increasing conversion and we'll stop there it's an ongoing process. month-on-month quarter-on-quarter you'll see increase the more time that that we spend on your site the algorithms only get better because of the data that we have gathered we gather data per product per click per search query per user right. so that's the kind of data that we are collecting right and for some of the enterprises we collect tbs and tbs of data because of the traffic on the site and the kind of catalogue they have. because the more data that we have now we can smartly use it to start showing more relevant results right and start showing products which again convert faster.
rep,so the machine learning will always keep improve.
rep,blue dress on sale again natural language queries typically people will say you don't have many people searching or are say typing long tail query right the percentage of of these queries a single digit. must be on the higher side say 7 8 percent 9 percent of your search queries would be long tail or natural language but these queries especially the long tail queries convert almost 60% more are higher than the usual queries because here the intent of the customer is very clear. sometimes they are even copying these queries from google from amazon or some other website and pasting them on your site right.
rep,and hence showing relevant results again becomes important from a volume perspective it is low from a business perspective this might bring in a significant amount of business on any site. here head head query search right again so here is an example when the intent of the customer is not clear i come onto your site and i look for die cast models i'm not yet sure what i want to buy right.
rep,and it starts showing me various different die cast model cars they are over five thousand four hundred and forty six results even if all the relevant right. and even if partially relevant 2500 relevant products you have and it's it's highly impossible for someone to look at all your products but in your navigation today when i click on die cast models you start guiding me to the right model cars that that i might be more interested in right. and that's what you might want to also replicate for your search result pages and here is an example right i go on to an electronic site and look for mobile the intent is not clear whether i'm looking for mobile mobile headphones cases and covers bluetooth headsets. but we have the technology that can identify the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance not just that but we immediately start showing results for the most important category that is mobile's here right.
rep,so customer if the customers is not looking for mobile they can come here and click on mobile headphones and start seeing headphones instead of mobiles. also over a period of time if say mobile case and covers became more popular than headphones then cases and covers will come on position two and headphones will go on position three. here's another example typically for apparel but again wanted to show this alexander wang is a designer who makes a lot of different products.
rep,shoes totes say shoulder bags dresses now if someone searches for alexander wang we can start showing all the products by alexander wang on a single page neatly but getting into each categories. giving customer the ability to browse through each of these products horizontally or vertically on a single page filters when i go through your site you do have some filters on your navigation or your category pages but i did not find any of any filters on your search results page. we give you the ability to have filters on search results page not just plain simple filters but also these filters are dynamic dynamic in nature in two ways. here is an example of filters but let me explain you how these filters are dynamic.
prospect,this <> that we have do we have to create the filters the facet for each one of the items or does this learn it itself.
rep,okay so i can know so in terms of which filters you would want you would want to create those and we create that as part of the implementation right so and this is based on not on an item but on the category. so to give you an example then this will give you a better feel of it so say for shoes as a category as part of the implementation are even after implementation so you would want to go and set it and very easily you can set it from our dashboard. so for shoes as a category you would want size ankle height width casual shoe type very specific filters for shoes right you can go into the dashboard and say for shoes as a category these are the filters that i need right. now every time someone searches for shoes and they might search as man men's casual shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes.
rep,and come in and look for men's nike men's adidas as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category that being shoes here the shoes filters will automatically kick in. so you do not have to set filters for each and every query you have to do it on a category base and then we start picking up those filters for the search results pages that's one. number two on day one you might have felt that size is a more important filter for shoes and that's why you have size on position one ankle height on position two width on position three.
prospect,so all of the different sizes that doesn't have to be created it's the system automatically picks them.
rep,yes so this is something that would picked up from the product catalogue feed.
prospect,okay but was that a custom size a custom field or was it merely an attribute of the description.
rep,that is something that i'll have to check we'll have to look at a product catalogue in terms of how it is being how we can make it readable right so once we looked at a catalogue then we'll be able to say that how we can use that data. if this information is somewhere captured on big-commerce if not within the description if there is a particular field or a particular way that that this particular information is being presented we can start picking it up from there.
rep,so that's the kind of tuning that we do during the implementation each and every catalogue for us is unique. so we need to start seeing and understanding in terms of where we can pick up the relevant information and what information would be relevant for a particular catalogue we we start feeling that in an unbxd readable format to the unbxd algorithms to make them readable and then starts making them searchable or maybe say start showing the filters or any other fields. so yeah i was saying one is someone who looks for shoes anyhow shoes filters would kick in.
rep,also over a period of time say if system is able to see a behaviour that width or say price as a filter is more often used than size then the price filter would automatically come on top and others would go down the order. and then lastly from a search perspective the last thing is the zero results page irrespective of how good search solution you have but search will have zero results and there could be various reasons.
rep,maybe you do not carry a product you do not carry a brand or the search queries so butcher that it's really difficult for the technology to understand the intent of the customer. and in that case we believe that the onus is on us to start guiding the customer and we do this in real time highly personalized for each user by placing two different widgets here recently viewed and recommendations. recently viewed are the products that the customer would have looked at during that session or the prior session on the site and now based on their affinity towards the brand towards the price point towards the colour based on that and attributes of the products. we now start recommending some of the products that they would be more like able to buy now this gives them the ability to either go back or go forward in their product discovery journey on on the site.
rep,so we make these pages also dynamic right zero results pages would not be static beyond this i'll skip this for today. but but a very high-level understanding i know we have lesser time and you are interested in seeing the back end dashboard so i'll quickly jump on to the dashboard. but for you to know with search we also club recommendations as a solution which is a 10 widgeter strategy and we give you ten different widgets to be placed on the sites to basically upsell and cross-sell products. which work on based on popularity wisdom of crowd content that is available for the products and also personalized per user.
rep,here are a few examples say homepage recommendations right top handpick just for you people who might have say visited your site earlier and they would have some inclination around the colour the price point or some sort of products on the site we can start showing them<>.
prospect,what if they were visiting what if they were visiting a competitor's website would would this pick up the cookies from that to recommend the products to be more particular.
rep,no we would not we would not do that so not from your competitor site but what we do is on your site we would see the behaviour <> coming onto the site from same geo-location during the same time of the day or same time of the week or year right to basically understand the seasonality and popularity of the products. and we start showing the products again the popular products based on that and two the moment they make two clicks on the site right we start gathering information about that particular individual's inclination on products. and we in real times start using that information to start making better recommendations for them. again some of the examples popular items right on the homepage these products were probably more popular this week and hence on on the homepage on pdp page right someone looking at a $65 bracelet.
rep,now we know that the price inclination is around $65 we know the style the colour that they are more inclined to and we start showing them the products pretty much in the same price range. you would not want to show a 200 dollar product to someone looking at a $65 product and that's why and this is a <> we also have you can go and feed this information into the system and i would want to start recommending plus or minus 5% 10% 20% in price point for this particular widget on a pdp page. but again the idea is to start recommending products which are similar to what there are already looking at and this is all dynamic right you do not have to go and i would say put in or say hard code these things theses are all dynamic content.
rep,if you would have noticed that say five out of ten people buying filters also or say 5 out of 10 people buying humidifiers also buy filters so something to upsell or say cross sell and start showing them accessories together with the product. again same thing someone buying a nail colour you might want to start recommending lip colours that might go well or be in the same category same style same shimmer and start showing those products to them as well.
rep,and different widgets which can be placed starting from your homepage to category pages to product pages search results pages and your add to cart and check out pages as well. i'll quickly jump onto my back-end dashboard we see if i can pull up my our new dashboard actually is up the the one that i'm showing is an older dashboard this is something that we recently launched.
rep,and we are moving all our customers to this new dashboard now.
prospect,is it you came out with a new dashboard.
rep,yes we did we just came up with a new dashboard i do have some screenshots and maybe i can walk you through that it looks like i've got the wrong password but i'll tell you in clear. in terms of what kind of differences high-level differences are available on the new dashboard which is just an extension to the older one so if you are seeing my screen right this is the dashboard and we have <>.
prospect,i don't see anything right now.
rep,oops my bad.
prospect,here we go.
rep,okay cool so once we have so this is i was actually trying to log in to our new dashboard but looks like i've got the wrong password here.
prospect,okay no problem are you showing the old one here.
rep,so yeah i'm showing you the old one and i'll show you some screenshots of the new one so here once we have the implementation done we will have all the information available about your your site. high level how many products you have what's the feed size like when was it last indexed and we can also manage multiple sites say you have a testing site a staging site or if you have multiple sites we can start managing them from a single dashboard login here. these are all your product catalogue fields or attribute we make them searchable non searchable completely for unbxd usage but you will still have complete visibility into it. these are your facets or filters so we can say add facet facet name price and the <>.
prospect,okay that is the part i have more questions about the facets is it something has to be manually entered or is this something that can be picked up through the back-end.
rep,no this is as part of implementation we would set this up.
prospect,okay so i have to do that for every products.
rep,no not for every product no these are the global filters these are the filters which can be made available across the site.
prospect,okay so you have site there right.
rep,sorry charles i missed that.
prospect,okay so you have site there and that means they did they create a site facet for every single product and gave that product a numeric site value and create that in a custom field and then the in the csv file or do i just create sites and then the machine learning picks up the sites of every product.
rep,so the ideal way is the first way that you said that if it's available in csv right that's the best way to do the facets but if that is not there<>.
prospect,<> this is martin so i've looked at <> unbxd is the second solution i got that and what's the solution for adding facets when i have this many product and i don't already have them.
rep,i will tell you that so if i was to open a product description correct so if now say if i'm looking at this particular product.
prospect,right like let's look at this one you have in 1400 milliamp mah. now like i would want to create i would want a facet for power and having say 1400 <> 5000 all day how did that get created <>.
rep,yes. charles so if all your products right have it in the same way right just like this one so if all your batteries have 14 have their capacity as number one right and their voltage in position two and then how many cells in position three we can use the machine learning to make these as facets right. so we can come in and say now these values are actually the capacity of the of the battery right and it automatically becomes a filter. now the challenge would be in this product you have it here but in say the other product it is it the center or it's towards the end then that would need some sort of data cleansing.
rep,but if it is this way we can still make it readable.
rep,right so over a longer i would say over over a longer period right the best practice is to have attributes because the more the where the better defined attributes you have the better would be the relevancy and how you can use some of this these pieces of information right.
rep,but that does not restrict you from having a good search solution it can obviously get better but yeah you can you can still learn and use it if the information that you have got.
prospect,okay <>.
rep,look at your product catalogue feed also and that's the part of our engagement right what we do is a 90-days poc right within the first 90 days we would come in and start implementing the solution. because some of these things these limitations might not be known right so this is something simple i can still answer as a sales guy some of the complex ones maybe the tech team can come in and answer. but every catalogue being so unique during those 90 days of implementation and taking the site live right we understand your catalogue better right how we can use that information we implement it. we take the site live you use it for four to six weeks and then if you like the solution you continue and if you do not like if you're not satisfied with what you see after end of those 90 days you can just walk out that no further commit towards unbxd.
prospect,okay let's go let's go  look at your <>.
rep,sure if you've got a few more minutes would you want to see the dashboard.
rep,yeah okay facets these are the global facets synonyms again we handle synonymous words automatically. but any industry jargon say in weightlifting world lifters are called shoes we would not know that. this is something which is a synonymous one right in that case you can come in and create a synonym if you already have a list of synonymous words we can do this as a part of our implementation or even you can raise a support ticket and our engineers can can come in and do this here. but it's very simple add a synonym lifters is equal to shoes bi-directional and create synonym and that's done.
rep,then comes our merchandising and i'll show you start from category rules merchandising for a category rule sneakers and this is where you can set filters for each category right. so now say sneakers as a category merchandise i can add banners now every time someone searches for sneakers however they search if 75% or more products are sneakers these banners will immediately start showing up. and these filters will automatically start showing you right and here you can come in and say i want price filter on top i want the colour filter on the second position the brand on three. i don't want to show the size filter and hide them the test filter i can hide it right now every time someone searches for sneakers these filters will automatically kick in.
prospect,and it will further emit before the search result page.
rep,yes the center filters for categories but it is applicable to the search results page.
rep,and now the the most important is the merchandising for search here you can merchandise the global rules meaning say you want to say always promote a particular brand or a home brand. do not show out of inventory products always promote my high marching products across the site those can be done within the global i would say rule sets. but i let me take a particular query and show you how you can create rule search sets so say for dress create rule and this is the demo site that we are looking the dashboard for. if i do dress on the site today you will see the first blue dress flower dress then the red then the black and then the another flower dress right and you will see the replica of this site on the back end dashboard also right.
rep,so it's a very i would say very ui based dashboard doesn't require a technical person to look into this typically a non technical merchandiser can also do merchandising by using this. and these are all relevant products based on popularity right based on the unbxd algorithm but based on your business you might want to run few rules. you might want to come and filter these products based on any of the attributes or you might want to say run promotions. so i will might want to say boost a particular brand that contains eliza now the eliza products are all on top even within that say i want this particular dress on position one i can drag and drop and pin product.
rep,i want this blue dress on position two i can drag and drop and pin products alright so per product placement for a particular query and if i do it they do it on site now in real time you see that results have been changed.
rep,similarly you can also slot meaning i can come in and say from position six to position eight show a product which is high in margin show a product which is new newly added to the catalogue right anything of that sort. and then the six to eight number of products it will start showing there and similarly you can now also start adding banners here and under new dashboard. what you can do is you can define a time period so i can say this particular rule right forever we have set maybe with promotions with banners and the filters for the query dress should last only from today for next two weeks right. say from today till end of march so you can also make it time based from when to when do you want to do it also you can you can differentiate it you can say this rule is only for visitors coming from desktop right.
rep,not for someone coming from mobile for mobile you can again create a different campaign we call them campaign there instead of rules right. so you can say this campaign is for mobile visitors this campaign is for desktop visitors or <> any device so device based and then time based rules you can say. and you can similarly also create landing pages say you're running clearances right clearance 2016 you can do that i don't see anything here. alright i can create a rule create rule merchandise convert to landing page click ok you have the complete catalogue available for you to curate you can again to run filters promotions banners.
rep,you can drag and drop you can pin products you can slot products right and then when i do clearance on the site i now start seeing the same products here. and i can now take this link and start using them for my marketing campaigns seo campaigns or any other marketing campaigns for that matter so that's the merchandising dashboard. few more rules which are available on the new dashboard as well but then on very high level we give you complete control to override the technology based on your business need reporting three levels of reporting.
rep,very high level executive reporting to understand what your top search queries are top products added to cart top search results queries and top clicked products. then we have a detailed query level reporting all your queries on the site you can define the time frame from when to when you want to see this data earlier right. and in terms of how they are converting and performing and i click on a particular query shows me is the sales trend trend line how the query has been performing and what are the products that are converting for this particular query. on the flip side what we also have is a product level reporting if you have category managers they can come here they can look at each and every individual product which product is performing better in terms of views and add to cart.
rep,when i click on a particular product again gives me the sales trend line and the i would say the queries where these products show up.
rep,so that's the dashboard with reporting now i know you had a so this is our new dashboard it looks much more cooler there are few more elements in terms of how and what you can do. you can also upload csv files instead of doing pinning manually you can also use your product catalogue feed to upload a csv file in terms of what position what product you want to show.
rep,so and these are the does the new dashboard it also gives a little more data in terms of your search revenue your revenue per search over total revenue revenue per search revenue per visit so a little more detail representation of the data i would say.
rep,so this is the solution now from a pricing perspective our pricing typically depends on the traffic do you have any estimate in terms of the what kind of traffic that you're going to see on the site. i know it's new not sure what kind of traffic you are already seeing on the site but then any any i would say expectations that you have for next one year and that this is the kind of traffic that you would see on your site. i mean i have no idea where anywhere from a hundred thousand to a million views a month. a hundred thousand to a million viewers a month okay.
rep,<a hundred thousand to a million viewers a month>. yeah and that's 10x right so what we can do is right i can i can give you a more of a bucketed pricing but then for you to start right. for you to do a poc with us the first three months would be at say a flat i would say around five thousand dollars for the first three right. wherein we do complete implementation right which will take around say six weeks for us to implement the solution and we'll give you approximately six weeks of go live period for you to start testing or start seeing the results on the live site.
rep,now the post ninety days right what we can start at at this point in time you say at hundred thousand visitors right and for that you would have i would say anywhere around twenty percent of your traffic must be looking at at search. then twenty thousand search sessions is what we are estimating so after ninety days i can say at 100000 sessions or at around twenty sessions the solution would be priced at $1000 a month. that would include the site search and product recommendations and then i can give you the range as your your traffic grows how the price would increase but if your traffic does not grow beyond this and you are not committed to pay anything extra but then yeah <>.
prospect,and what if and what if the traffic is significantly lower <>.
rep,yes so our minimum pricing is a thousand dollars charles that's the minimum package we have to any customers.
prospect,<> thousand dollars for twenty thousand search sessions per month for three months.
rep,yes that would be no no so but what we will do a minimum commitment of twelve months after the first three months.
rep,the first three months is at five thousand dollars flat fee which will include implementation and which will also include these six weeks of go live for you right.
rep,irrespective of what the traffic is and it can be higher it can be lower now beyond 90 days we will start at minimum thousand dollars if your traffic is very low. but if your traffic is higher than that then i can give you a price range also i can include that in the contract so you do not have to even worry when your price when your traffic grows how your price gonna be. and it will not typically double right so if double the traffic the price will not double it might be say 50 or 60 percent higher.
rep,as you grow right your per search session cost will start coming down.
rep,as you grow the traffic your price per session per search session will start coming down does that make sense.
prospect,okay perfect so is there anything else that you want to show me <or you think you need to say before i go and discuss with my team and make a decision>.
rep,no this is this is all from my end i would have loved to show you the roi but because we do not have the site statistics i'm not in a position to show you the roi. otherwise we take an roi approach wherein i can take your search sessions and order value conversions and tell you that by spending so much with unbxd we can guarantee you this much amount of increase on the in the revenue. but then we don't have that baseline number yet so unfortunately that's not something i can share but i can surely tell <>.
prospect,yeah what happened what i'm sorry to realize and it seems like there's going to be have to be a significant amount of work on our end for preparing the database with the faceted categories because that's where the value is going to come i believe yeah go ahead.
rep,no i agree the faceted navigation that is surely one of the key elements on the site but then when you do that right relevancy is also important or you start showing relevant results. starting from your spell check to even autosuggest to ultimately showing relevant results for search results page right and all of these elements together is what builds an overall product discovery or a great experience right.
prospect,<> no this is great and i got to cut the meeting off now i gotta take off for another meeting but i'm gonna go talk with partners.
prospect,and then what and what do we do with that.
prospect,excellent alright thank you so much for your time and i really appreciate it.
rep,thank you charles just last thing i don't have your email address i have mike's email address if i'm not wrong but not not your's.
prospect,yeah mine is it charles@rchobbyshop dot com.
rep,okay awesome <>.
prospect,or those on intro@rchobbyshop dot com and we all we get that as well.
prospect,perfect i appreciate it.
rep,okay awesome great charles thank you.
prospect,thank you have a great night.
rep,you too have a good day bye.
rep,welcome to zoom. enter your participant. you are in the zoom meeting now. there are one participants in the meeting.
prospect,goodbye
rep,guil so do you need to do you need to take care of that taken care of.
prospect,its been  it's underway.
prospect,purchase our issues around shipping address we're getting it fixed but i was having it nevada that's all.
rep,i see got it got it perfect so pat i know we've exchanged enough emails and we've had a lot of conversations around different things so we wanted to sort of do a status check to see where you are with with the process what can we do to help you get to a decision or a timeline and what are the next steps in your opinion that we should be taking care of to get started.
rep,we are excited about the opportunity but we just wanted to make sure that we stay in line with what your expectations are and continue to help you champion us to internally.
prospect,yeah i'm just gonna check here i believe i sent a note to order dynamics last week actually let me let me just check here that's the case oh yeah an email on friday.
prospect,i haven't got i haven't got anything back from them yet but i get i get forward them the document that you provided unbxd search and implementation steps.
prospect,which explains the and then i explained to them that we want to go with approach b which is the rest api.
prospect,and so i think that for me that the next step would be to make sure that we can you know that we can actually i'm sure it can happen but i just want to spit the double check before we actually sign anything so to make sure that that you guys can you know vice versa can integrate with order dynamics and find so on or what's required to do so you know.
rep,got it so absolutely sure so what i'll do is two things pat one if i can't if you can request i'm assuming you need at all with order dynamics or them to come in to confirm that this is doable.
prospect,yeah yeah so let me tell you my steps our first step i asked if we could have a call they said listen send me whatever you have which is which is this document i mean if you have additional details that you think are necessary i can pour those but so far i sent that and then they said they would look at it and then afterwards we can you know then we could set up a call right.
prospect,once once there kind of understand maybe questions that they need to ask and so on.
rep,got it got it no totally make sense so so we'll we'll work with you on scheduling that caller they have questions or if it's hopefully very self-explanatory.
prospect,is this the only document i should send them or is there more information you think they need.
rep,that's the only document i don't think there's anything else beyond that but it was me and.
prospect,i can tell you as well concurrently i spoke with jeff the vp and he's on board he's the high-level discussion with the cfo she's on board as well except i think that they both want to feel comfortable just to know that obviously we can integrate with order dynamics right so for us as soon as.
prospect,i get we're going to pass that and we know exactly you know what you guys need to do in order by versa then i think that we're pretty good right.
rep,got it so in the meantime what would you pad then is i know you think you the pricing and stuff where you've not sent you a sort of a formal agreement so i'll get that to you at least so you can start reviewing that and if there's any legal review that you need to get done we can go through that process in parallel so both are ready to go at the same time whenever we are ready to execute so from that does that make sense hopefully.
rep,and you can.
prospect,and just like you know the sort of we've made a provision in our budget to accommodate you know the cost that you noted in that last email i got from you guys the the maximum was four grand bottom was 20 to 50 a month.
prospect,we we've budgeted for that and so that we're we we have money set aside for the rest of our fiscal which runs on till october.
prospect,so the only the other thing that that maybe you know at some point i mean this can happen probably ask her but i'm sure you noted i don't know if you know deloitte at all we we we work for the company has actually just recently purchased by deloitte they are the consultants and they help us with our search and with our google analytics tracking.
prospect,when i say search i mean seo i should have done.
rep,i see.
prospect,and what were what i'm interested in getting them to do and i don't know if you guys have used this before we want to turn on enhanced e-commerce in google analytics.
prospect,you guys have an experience with that.
rep,my team does that i personally gone.
rep,i know that in some instances we have worked with enhanced google analytics and supported retailer in doing certain things.
prospect,yeah and just let you know the reason we interested in doing that is inside i mean i know that you guys will be providing you guys showed me that there will be a platform and admin a portal there where i can log in and we can see how things are converting and so on but because everything is running through google analytics we'd also like it to go through there and if the search is configured in a certain way then enhanced e-commerce inside google analytics can actually track the search and see what's converting there as well and they can help us track kind of overall you know conversions and so on.
prospect,so that's what that email was about i sent you last week i believe it was asking you and i'm it i was asking you the questions that the lord was providing me.
rep,i see got it.
rep,do you know the company was it data set up so on by any chance.
prospect,sorry me.
rep,was it was data consulting is that what the company design.
prospect,yeah they're called cornerstone.
rep,cornerstone okay.
prospect,they're a toronto-based company as far as i know.
rep,got it okay got it no problem.
rep,so yeah from our perspective pak the the idea is since you're doing an api our approach the onus on unboxd is much less however there are certain things that we can do in how we make the responses available.
rep,that you know that makes it makes where what pillared wants to track and in google analytics all of that stuff can be done including the auto suggest or especially i should say the auto suggest.
rep,for that perspective there are a few things we can we can bring to the table so that's not a problem.
rep,that we can locate and figure out what their name yep.
prospect,one of the things i'm really interested in i'm sure that you guys have this sort of baked in but we didn't discuss it specifically is the algorithm that so when someone searches what level of you know that of customization do we have on our end to modify the algorithm so we sort of give you an example sony has just released a new mirror-less camera so it would be our want here for example that if someone were to search mirror-less that we probably have that camera show up one of the first if not the first.
rep,so that's the whole merchandising console that we have shown you you have the capability to your marketing merchandising team or buying team will have the capability to make those of those types of decisions and changes to how the search perform.
prospect,okay perfect exactly well that's the kind of thing we're we're looking to do.
rep,yep and i think that that's that's a very straightforward one.
prospect,okay perfect .
rep,part of our implementation walk to you do a training program as well to walk everybody through what that would look like.
prospect,sure and can you just remind me i think you had said that but i can't remember now i think you had said that there will be an account manager assigned to our account and that we will have a regular call with that person.
rep,that is correct so the account manager would be what because we call them as the customer success managers.
rep,and that is correct so you will get a dedicated customer success manager on your account they're the ones we're going to walk you through the implementation they are going to coordinate everything to do with search configuration training any kind of design they're the ones who can work with of order dynamics if need be and if engineering needs to come in they'll they'll coordinate everything they need to but there are times when if they're not available you'll also have support team so we'll have the 24/7 support team also available in case in a 2 am in the morning and everybody's sleeping we have a support team that's also available in cases of emergencies and stuff .
prospect,make sense ok all right awesome i just i thought you have said that i just a firefighter.
rep,no absolutely and that's our sort of standard ml so that's exactly how we operate.
prospect,ok perfect sounds great.
rep,all right all right so it's next step that will obviously be bothering you to figure out what the next steps are on order dynamics in the meantime we'll send you the agreement just let us know if there's any changes any feedback on that if not we can make the agreement in such a way that you have if you want if you order that everything takes takes a little bit longer we can have a clause in there to say you know validations for motor dynamics and you know before sell any reason it doesn't work out you have an option to cancel the contract so let me know if that's what's required at the end of the day we can figure out those details those as well.
prospect,sure sure oh wait if you send over the first one i mean i i'm hoping that we can all actually resend this to them now and hopefully i mean we've been dealing with them on a number of different launch issues like post launch issues.
prospect,so yeah those are pretty critical to us like for example we're gonna have to which we didn't expect like so quickly after launch we have to re-plan out our whole checkout process which is good news and bad news for you guys i mean it's bad news in a sense that's getting in front of the search but it's good news in the sense that it'll be more effective conversion.
prospect,hey monal are you still with us.
rep,okay josh i'm sorry i was speaking maybe the voice in cut i was saying that that's actually pretty good because you know when we are doing the search component all of the other so the things have been worked out so there's a smoother poc and then you have a more effective poc also so you know the new baseline that's been established based on all the changes .
prospect,yeah yeah exactly.
rep,yep so that's that's fantastic all right.
prospect,okay perfect thanks very much.
rep,absolutely thanks pat really appreciate your help and thank you so much for your continued support.
prospect,all right have a great day guys.
rep,you too pak thank you.
rep,so owen just a quick introduction my name is sharath and i'm __ from ___ what i essentially wanted to do today is give you a quick background about who we are the kind of customers we work with with across the country and then i my team essentially went through a quick review of your search capabilities today on the website and we essentially found areas where we could actually have an input so i'll take you through the review that we've done and i'll share that worksheet with you as well and post that i can take you through some of the real life examples of the implementations we've done and then we can obviously discuss more details depending upon how you want to take this forward.
rep,does that work for you?.
prospect,yeah sounds good.
rep,i direct do a quick look at your website you use magento today and you use  nextopia for search is that correct.
prospect,sorry what was the question.
rep,you use magento as a platform today and you use nextopia for search.
rep,okay okay just wanted to confirm that. awesome.
rep,so as a company we are headquarters here in mountain view been around for about 7 years now worked with about a 120 enterprises brands across the country about 1200 global websites all in all and in terms of pr scale we do open xs of ___ this is essentially talking about the overall number of api calls we do across all our customer base.
rep,and when we started site search was our primary core product but as we matured as company today we have solutions for site search category basis we also do product recommendations and the last 6 months we came up with complete personalization and segment and target solution as well.
rep,so today we have a product suite that covers the entire product discovery experience into that right.
rep,and when we started out as a company initially site search and personalizations because a lot of relevancy in the fashion and the retail space so express rue21 these were our some of our first customers who came on board in the home improvement space we worked with ashley bed bath and beyond hsn ___ to name a few but in the same time we also started onboarding a bunch of b2b and customers in retailers in in the hardware b2b space. we worked with ib supply milwaukee primarily worked with the garment worked with parts warehouse __ container npx tools to name a few so a bunch of experienced hardware suppliers.
rep,so  this is a quick background about us.
rep,and in terms of a product since you're already using nextopia you'd like to know that we're also a __ solution its completely hosted on amazon web services and we're co-looking for a ad sense across 5 different regions across the globe 3 in the us 1 in germany and 1 in singapore so that even if you choose to go global at some point in time we could still support your global aspirations.
rep,so now i just wanted to quickly take you through the customer experience report we had prepared.
rep,what we tried doing here was to try and mimic the customer behavior as to what he or she would go through when they try and discover product on your site and we've taken the entire journey  right from the search interaction to the search box like you start showing up suggestions is it visual is it guided does it really help in making the impact on the customer in their search interactions and then we look at the error provisions in the site in terms of how do you manage the spellings how do you manage the synonyms and then finally we look at core elements of relevancy right here we do we've taken 3 4  different snapshots just to give you a perspective where we think the opportunity is and just to set some context one of the key things why unboxing __ so far is a lot of customers a lot of search partners whom i've interacted with talk a lot about machine learning but in that technically become a fat word today but what we essentially do is we do something called as contextual relevance where most of the search systems have been built on the principles of a document search engine we've tried to build a very very pure plate product high product search where our system today our ai platform actually understands product and the context in which those products are searched for which is why while i take you through some live examples you'll see that even for long tail queries queries with more than 2  to 3 words partial sku searches you will still find the most relevant results with which we've built on these systems.
rep,okay awesome first i'll take you through some of the examples so i first look at certain relevancy examples and i compare the what i found on your browse pages and what i find on your search pages right.
rep,i looked at __ filters you always have those products and these are essential with products that are available in the browsed pages when i search for it i dont find exactly the same products that initially need to be shown right.
rep,then i looked at ozone systems ozone generators you have them but again i found a niche background of search for it right.
rep,then i looked at commercial stainless steel housing we have all these housings available and we didn't find it so one of the few observationsfirst when i used one word generally the search results were accurate as i start going to the 2nd word 3rd word where i add context to my search is where i see differences between how products show up on your browsed pages to how products show up on search and generally a long tail has a lot of irrelevant queries like it'll still show me one or two results which are accurate but it also shows me a lot of results that are actually not accurate.
rep,and then i looked at a very specific query this is and generally what we've observed is a lot of our customers usually when the number of keyword search exceed beyond 2 or 3 words the intent of the user is usually much higher because these are users who are probably exactly know what they want to buy and that is why with most of the customers who use our product have seen that the conversions on site search is generally 3 times more than the conversions on the site overall the percentage on the search traffic would be just 10 or 20 % but the revenue impact is much higher because search converts 2 or 3x better than your browse search which is why across the retails landscape today search is being taken as one of the number top 3 priorities with every retail right.
rep,so this was the issue i first saw with very very exact name search right.
rep,then i looked at your experience to how experience that you show that to your users when they interact with the search box right.
rep,you do show some popular search is good but i did not see any visual elements i did not see any top keywords or popular products in a visual fashion which is one thing that we recommend that you add because you have nice visuals of your products available in the browse pages why not show that in the search box when people start looking for products because we generally see the user engagement increases dramatically when you add pictures within the search experience right.
rep,then i looked at certain synonym and error corrections i misspelt words portable water filter i didnt see all the relevant products here then i looked for lab water test which is laboratory water test i just expanded the words lab to laboratory i dont find consistency in results right again generally what most retailers are forced to do is to manually build a list of synonyms to correct even singular plural words.
rep,and that is something we believe can be completely automated or by an ai system right.
rep,and then i did another misspell its not exactly a misspell to count it off i used a space in between and the results changed between the two different kinds of search.
rep,with me on this so far.
rep,you see that this would be a problem.
rep,and again its very easy to point out mistakes on someones site what i also wanted to take you through is take you through some examples of implementations that we've done some in your vertical some in a different vertical and ill take you through 3 or 4 different verticals so that you'll get the like the depth of implementations that we actually have right and the kind of customisations that we could actually have so i'll starts with a part manufacturer parts warehouse ___ those are 25 30 million dollars online for them if you've seen their site three years ago you actually would've found 2 different search boxes because they had 2 kinds of customers one customer who exactly knew which parts to buy the other kind of customer who did not know the part  ___ who probably come and search for a model name so they though having 2 different search boxes will solve the problem but it ended up amplifying the problem because now you had to optimize for two different search experience and the relevancy got completely skud.
rep,so what we first we built them a parts finder where you can essentially find any part in 3 clicks then we built them a search experience where in we unified it and today if you just take the first example here and you start typing in what you would notice here is one side you see parts one side you see model names and then you see all the top searches that are displayed and there is some visual element too.
rep,this is one of the most basic kind of auto suggest we could see right.
rep,then if you go to a fashion retail space somebody like express large retailer roughly around 150 million dollars just an online business for them there are a lot more personalizations that needs to be done a lot more sleak looking images that needs to be shown because based on the parallel in the fashion space.
rep,so what we did for them is the moment you start looking for jeans the experience we've built is to essentially show if jeans for men jeans for women jeans of specific size and then we also added a segmentation block like because buying behaviors especially in fashion and retail keep changing in every city depending on the city that you are coming in from we'll show you what is the most popular color or style in that city so that it is more relevant for people coming from that city so this is essentially coming in from the city that i've logged in from right.
rep,im in new york today so its definitely showing this.
rep,then it shows me all the top keywords and one things you would notice is as i keep hovering around these images keep changing so that its more visually impacting .
rep,do you agree to this.
rep,no no it is more visually impacting i just wanted to does it make any sense to you .
prospect,oh yeah that's cool.
prospect,that's cool stuff.
rep,and then its not just a plain dumb template if you now change this query to say dress in express catalog there is no dress for men so men as an option is not even showing up right but i change this to dress shirt dress shirt is available to  men so men as an option shows up so it intelligently changes products ui everything dynamically so that for a user who is interacting with your search box the user engagement increases dramatically right.
rep,and then the same thing applies for even auto parts like in auto parts which i will show in this like a you end up having a lot of skus like they're based out of conneticut __ and they have about a million skus in their inventory and so its very important to create and guide the customer because he or she will get lost if they keep going through category pages searching for a million skus.
rep,so what we did for them is a you go and choose a model number and now if you want to look for a mirror the experience will show all the top key words and depending on the ok you want a __ mirror we show you results we show you a sku id we show you price and you can just add product to cart right from the search box so that even if you have to buy more than a product you can quickly add product to cart when you want.
rep,and by doing this we've seen that their conversion rate started increasing dramatically.
rep,and we tried creating something similar in grocery as well because you know in grocery people don't come into a site to buy one product they buy 15 20 30 products in every interaction so what we did for them is this is a customer based in south east asia if i wanna buy milk the way we've created this template is you can actually change quantity add products to cart from the search box depending on the zip code they're coming in from you can actually show up an ad a discount a coupon anything for that location.
rep,and then we show you all the commonly searched terms popular brands and the categories and so on.
rep,so that we make it more  personal more interactive to the user.
rep,okay you think a template like this will make sense for you as well yeah right so this is the first experience which is more to the user experience right the second thing that i found as an opportunity on your site was for like if i do a misspelling right it shows me irrelevant products if i do a singular plural words with synonyms it is not showing you the most interesting results.
rep,you can still correct them by manually building the list of synonyms but ideally you would want to automate it right.
rep,so what we tried doing is like i'll take an example in this apparel site like black leather jacket right i can misspell it as blck lathe jaket im misspelling all the 3 words right what the system is doing is it is a  auto correcting it to black leather jacket and it is showing results in the ___.
rep,even though ive misspelled not just one but all the 3 words and you don't have to do create a rule create a synonym manually.
rep,makes sense.
rep,and the same thing works for synonyms right because in apparel especially there are so many ways to look for the same thing like a simple thing like t-shirts i can look at it as t-shirts while you might say t shirts without space or somebody younger might just come and say tees right if i got 600 products t shirts now i look for tees if i ideally get he same number of products so the intent of the user is not changing we get the same 628 results right so these are things that we do automatically without you having to go through any manual type of a __ right.
rep,and the last thing is the core relevancy itself right as i was pointing it out when i did for one word queries search would behave correctly  but i start increasing the number of words and add some context to it i don't find the right results right .
rep,so like i can show you like i can say dress on sale what the system does it picks up all the dresses and then looks for all the dresses which are actually on sale and displays the result suite .
rep,so its very accurate its and even if it goes __ they're finding all the dresses which are actually on sale right and you can do all your strategy we can show all kinds of overlays if you want to have a message called sale only to left new arrival all these lays can be built in right .
rep,and even within filters ill show you have the color filters that are showing up here right now if i change his to blue dress you will see the color blue is automatically on top.
rep,so all these filters also change dynamically depending on the user and you can create very very unique rules where if there are specific price points which is most popular with your set of users right that price point will automatically move up on top like if you have different price passage like this is a different example like 0-30 30-60 and this you figure 30-60 is the most actively bought price range then 30-60 will automatically move up on top.
rep,and you can do this for a specific geo as well you might wanna say like all people coming into the site from big cities probably buy more expensive water filter but people coming in from a tier 2 city will probably buy a slightly cheaper water filter right.
rep,you can also add those geo segment rules if you want.
rep,so just the system can do a lot of unique things so that user behavior is always right.
rep,and its just not the products you also work for non products where if somebody comes to your site and look for returns like what they're trying to see is your return policy on the site it'll automatically take you to the return policy page.
rep,so it just not works for products it also works for non products as well .
prospect,self learning or you gotta set up.
rep,you don't have to setup anything.
rep,it learns on its own.
prospect,even the return page.
prospect,how does it know.
rep,so because when you when we start integrating with your site one of the first things we do is we ask you for your catalog we look at your site map and we also install analytics unboxed analytics on your site.
rep,so the combination of these two we essentially map out your complete site  your products how people look for products and then by since we've implemented analytics and we do it at the first step of our integration process so if you take 4 weeks to go live in those 4 weeks there's enough learning on how people look for information on your site right.
rep,so the system starts learning by itself and starts showing the most relevant results to people right.
rep,so despite the last 30 minutes that i spoke a lot about machine learning we also understand that we could have a  merchandising marketing team who might want to source specific products  with specific slot within specific sites  for that what we've done is we’ve actually created a dashboard we have a dashboard for all our product like this is the  dashboard i am showing for our site search product similarly we have a dashboard for our product recommendation and we have a dashboard for our for your category page it’ll also manage category page too right.
rep,so this dashboard  and the merchandising capabilities of the dashboard i'll take you through that in sometime gives all the flexibilities for your marketers as well to start creating campaigns to create custom landing pages to create you might want when somebody looks for a specific product you want the new arrival products to always show up in the first slot or you might want to show the highest margin product always in the first slot you can also create a rules within our merchandising tools as well.
rep,and one thing is i can show you the most flashy presentation with lot of good examples but we understand being  this business for the last 7 years that  every retailer is unique the customer you get on your site is also unique and what might work for say a floyn container or an npx tools  might not work for you right  so what we do is we have a pilot process where we come use an inpage ajax model an inpage ajax model is something like you could see in on express right where if i say i'm sorry i'm working out of a hotel today the internet is really slow right if if i say search for jeans if you notice the page you see the header and the footer loading first and then the search results the passage filters are all loading right this is an inpage ajax and implementation where all you’re doing is giving us a header footer and an empty div tag and whenever people search for something we are printing everything right from here  till the footer right.
rep,its an inpage ajax implementation till this section actually right.
rep,so in this methodology all you need to do is give us your catalog feed you install our analytics we will build  all the dev dev work is actually done by our end.
rep,and will put it in a staging environment for you to test it then your team can do all the testing they need then you can do that.
rep,so we can essentially take to live in a 4 week window.
rep,and then we give you 6 to 8 weeks to use the product in those 6 to 8 weeks we guarantee you are 10 percent lift in conversions you don't see your left you walk away no questions asked you see a lift then you come into a 1 year contract with us so that you’re actually testing the solution  you are ensuring that there is sufficient business impact at least a 10x roi with whatever investment you make to that unbox and then you use our solution and we put this on the contract and the reason we do this is because of all the 120 customers we’ve done we've had great success where across the board it could be a furniture retailer or fashion retailer whether a b2b retailer a  mass merchant a catalogue retailer  as a minimum they’ve all seen a 10% lift in conversions it could be 20 30 40 we don’t know but 10% is something that we guarantee the first 60 days you don't see it you walk away. sounds fair.
prospect,sounds impressive.
rep,when do we start then.
rep,so i'll take you through the rack i didn't mean to put you in a spot i am sorry over that.
rep,so i will quickly take you through the implementation stages as well as the dashboard and you could let us know i am not sure how much the holiday season impacts you is it like the is it business as usual  throughout the year do you see some substantial peaks during the november december time frame you can let us know we can do a pilot starting 1st of august like we can take the month of august to do the implementation you can test the product if you’re using nextopia today we can also do an ab test where 50% package goes to nextopia the remaining 50% comes to unbox all through september october and if you’re you’re you’re at least doing  10% or more better than nextopia from 1st november you can cut over to our cost.
prospect,sorry what was that again.
prospect,i was kinda thinking about some other stuff.
rep,sure no problem.
rep,what i was saying was ig you think this is feasible we can use the month of august to the implementation of unbox search i know you use nextopia today we can a av test across september and october where 50% of  your traffic goes to nextopia the remaining 50% comes to unbox and in those 2 months you can compare it on a daily weekly monthly basis and if you feel if unbox is atleast consistently 10% or more better than nextopia then come novemeber you can switch over to unbox.
rep,enter into a contract.
prospect,okay i mean i like that idea it sounds fantastic.
rep,and i can show you and i like i i i am assuming you use google analytics today if you have if you have access to ga you can login to go under ga you have a section called behaviour if you  click on behaviour you’ll have all the site search matrix because basically visits without search if you can tell me how many search sessions you get a month what is your average order value what is your conversion rate i can build an roi sheet and show you that if you have to spend  say $500  $1000  per month on unbox what is the return on investment that you would see for a 10% liftin conversions.
rep,i can like show it to you right now if you have that data available.
prospect,behaviour site search.
prospect,month of june.
prospect,you said a month.
rep,yeah just give me a months data just let me quickly put it out and show it to you.
prospect,ok what numbers you want.
rep,what is your number of sessions per month.
prospect,sessions with search  4202.
rep,ok.
rep,and what is your search conversion rate.
rep,usually when you see with with search it’ll also show i think there’ll be a conversion rate number.
rep,conversion rate and average order value those are the 3 numbers .
prospect,i don’t see those in here.
rep,if you don't have that in the actual overview section of the overall ga you’ll have your overall sessions you’ll have your overall conversion rate again having overall average order value one of the it should be .
prospect,there’s behavioural overview.
prospect,conversions.
prospect,e commerce conversion rate.
rep,yup.
prospect,is 1 point 02%.
rep,and average order value.
prospect,sorry what was that.
rep,average order value.
prospect,260.
rep,and this you’re seeing under behavior right.
prospect,that was under conversions e commerce overview.
prospect,they don’t have any monitory data.
rep,oh okay so what’ll happen is in that conversion rate number that would’ve been the conversion rate on the entire site because if we look at their number of sessions will be more than 4000.
rep,it’ll be closer to 40 50 thousand i guess.
prospect,yeah so for behaviour overview we have.
rep,how many page views.
rep,i got page views.
prospect,page views is 237674.
rep,okay so usually sessions will be half of page views that’s the usual method and i can tell you as an example.
rep,and audience overview for the month of june is 90417 sessions.
rep,okay i can say give you a  more accurate representation.
rep,i am just doing in some ___.
rep,i’m sorry if ___.
rep,so if you look at it 90000 sessions 1% conversion rate roughly $260 you'll probably make about $200000 a month in your site.
rep,is that an accurate number.
prospect,lets see.
prospect,yeah that is a little bit lower than i have but almost right on the money.
rep,okay so and this is an average i'm saying between 1000 and 1500 dollars is that is what it costs for us to power your  search and browse pages right.
rep,even at a 5% improvement we're giving you an 8x roi at a 10% improvement we're giving you a 16x roi anything more than 10% your roi is much higher.
rep,if its 12.
rep,50 its even more higher roughly 20x roi.
prospect,and you guys gaurantee atleast a 10%.
rep,yeah and and this is irrespective owen.
rep,the first three months the first 60 days you see for yourself you don't see this 5 10 15 so don't don't see a substantial increase you can just cancel we have no obligations there is a small one time setup fee of about 1000 to 1500 dollars  depending on the site that we would charge  and we don't charge you a monthly fee like  you pay us $1500  that's what you pay for 3 months we will build it out you test it out for 60 days  you see the 10% lift you continue with the contract all you have to  do is send us a  note that we don’t wish to continue.
rep,that's about it there is no obligations for staying with us for your if you don't see the value (ok) right if you look at about 12.
rep,50 even at a 5% increase you are seeing roughly a 10x conversion rate.
rep,10x roi.
rep,if its 10% you see about 20 if its 15 to 20% you see about 20 times rise.
rep,20 times better.
prospect,that's pretty amazing.
rep,and you see it for yourself before you buy it right probably if you no obligations at all yet if you ask me yeah there will be the smallest amount of risk you would take from an investment standpoint you pay us 1500 dollars for implementation.
rep,that’s the only investment you make for the first 90 days right.
rep,you don’t see it you walk away but if you do see even if you not 10% even if you get a 5% we’re still increasing your revenue by about 15000 dollars if its 10% we increase your revenue by 25000 dollars right.
rep,so this is something minimum that we would see and you have all the access to all the tools i’m happy to give you some reference checks you can talk to a few customers who’ve used that and you can decide for yourself.
rep,there’s a no obligatory 3 months term if you like it then you will have to sign a 1 year essentially you need to commit with us for atleast a year if you see the value in first 90 days.
rep,that’s the only __ we have.
prospect,and the year does is still billed monthly.
rep,yeah so after the first 3 months is when the monthly charges we charge will start.
rep,and we’ll charge you 1250 every month.
prospect,and and how do you figure out how much it is a month.
rep,the fee is consistent so if you tell me that your sessions is about 90000 we generally add a buffer and give you a bucket of about a 125000 sessions where if even if there are months that you might do slightly more you’re still covered and you don’t have to get into __ situatuations.
rep,we give you about a 125000 sessions in total if you exceed beyond the 125000 sessions there’ll be a small overage fee like if you ask me if you do 150000 sessions in a month how much you might have to pay you might probably have to pay 150 dollars extra or 200 dolalrs extra.
rep,its usually 2 cents a session beyond the included number of sessions.
prospect,yeah i’m looking on here back to december and the most we hit was 103000 sessions.
rep,103000 ok.
rep,so if i include a 125000 sessions you even your growth is by 15 20 % you will still be safe.
rep,right and our our intent owen is to prove you the value in the first 90 days and we’re happy to do an ab test with nextopia doing an ab test is extremely simple with more like i’m sure you’ll have google tag manager my team can frame on how to do it.
rep,on google tag manager you can essentially split the traffic 50 50 where 50 percent comes to unbox 50% goes to nextopia.
rep,you can compare it with yourself and then see the value and if you see the value you continue with us.
prospect,and how much it will be the implementation fee.
rep,its 1500.
rep,1500.
rep,yeah  and its a one time fee that you pay.
rep,but also note that in the poc the 6 to 8 weeks usage you do we’ll not charge you for the usage there’s no other fee apart from this 1500 in the first 3 months.
prospect,so 1500 is basically your kinda to make sure you set up and everythings ready for to us to sign the contract.
rep,correct so we essentially take to live in about 4 to 5 weeks and then you have about 6 to 7 weeks to use the services and in those 6 to 7 weeks we wanna prove that we are worth 1250 dollars a month.
rep,if we’re worth it the first 90 days that is 3 months you decide to move ahead with us or you say just cancel it.
rep,and our contract will not be activated.
prospect,okay so alright when do you need the answer by.
rep,i would love to get an answer right now but i can send you all this data its its its completely understand you might wanna see to it ill send you this roi sheet ill just screen it up prepared this for another customer ill also send you we have an implementation guide if you just wanna just run it with any of your developing team or anybody i can just ill just show this to you this is how the implementation document looks like.
rep,we have 3 different approaches we mostly use we recommend the inpage ajax approach because you don’t have to your development does not have to get involved.
rep,we’ll do all the work at our end and that’s what most of our customers prefer.
rep,but after a few months if your team wants greater control they want to do a back end api integration we can always do that .
rep,but this is the approach we recommend and this has step by step instructions on what needs to be done and as you would see most of the work is done by us.
rep,the only thing that we expect you to do is to install our analytics and we essentially give you a javascript to install and its like a 3 4 hour work with one of your developers and thats about it and all the integration is done by unbox.
rep,and ill share this document with you you could review that if you think you’re good to goi can send you the contract and you can review it sign it out and on 1st august we can start our implementation.
prospect,and send to me to me it seems like a no brainer to try it out just the only issue is i gotta get approval for spending 1500 dollar.
rep,no i totally understand that and again the way you should look at it is you’re getting a much better solution than nextopia today enterprises are used by so many retails across the country and and in 90 days you will know the difference because you have a named account team to talk to is there is any issue you have a customer success manager you’ll have that customers __ contact our support is 24/7 365 days a year.
rep,we are a growing company and we work really hard and we love working with retailers and you’ll see that in the first 90 days.
rep,so we’ll make sure that its worth your time and worth your investment and we need that opportunity.
rep,thats all we ask for.
rep,right and this is the dashboard ill just give you like a quick 2 minute tour the dashboard will be a lot more comprehensive than the dashboard you would see with nextopia.
rep,this gives you more of an executive summary of all your business matrix.
rep,you can essentially if somebody new joins the team he or she can just go to our resource centre look at your our tutorials and videos.
rep,and then if something goes wrong with the configuration and if you want to do a root cause analysis we give you all the logs that you could always review at any point in time.
rep,and then we give you extremely comprehensive analytics right.
rep,both for the typerheads the templates that i showed you and also for search right.
rep,at a high level we give you all your top searched queries you top 0 results your top clicked products and your ordered products and then we also give you a very very detailed query reporting as well.
rep,i’m sorry my internet is a little bit slow today.
rep,while this loads ill show you a quick video like this is the report im talking about all the top search queries clicked products zero results and ordered products and then you can drill down to an individual query report like if you want to know there was a specific query like your ozone systems right like it was doing really well last month but suddenly the performance of that query has dropped you can do a quick root cause analysis let me say why is the performance __ right.
rep,it’ll essentially say okay a specific query like coupons has went wrong about 300 hits but no conversions what went wrong.
rep,you can do an individual deep dive on any single query see all the products associated with this query there are no products associated that’s why this query is not doing well.
rep,so you can do that analysis really well.
rep,and then you also have a merchandising tool as well ill show you a quick review of this my internet is bad so like it it’ll give you an option to go and create a campaign all you have to do is click here create a campaign once you create a campaign you can define a  start date and an end date to that campaign right if you don’t define an end date the campaign keeps running infinitely.
rep,and one thing you see with us that you don’t see with anybody else is the ability to actually define an audience to a campaign that you want to.
rep,you can essentially go and say i want to create a campaign for all new visitors coming from desktop coming from a specific state or a specific city and coming in from a specific channel it could be an email campaign that you would’ve done it could be a social campaign it could be a google adword campaign right and as you choose creating these segments you see your own analytics it’ll tell you whats the potential reach of a campaign right.
rep,and once you create a campaign its also important that marketing teams should have 2 different ideas.
rep,they want to do an ab test of which idea is better right.
rep,we give you an option within the dashboard to do an ab test.
rep,right you can create an ab test you can say i wanna decide the winner with the highest number of click to rates to decide that and then you get into the core merchandising section this you might also see on nextopia as well but you don’t see the audience refinement part.
rep,here you can do boosting slotting sorting filling and we have a preview screen where any rules you set the product suite changes.
rep,and you can create any number of custom base you want.
rep,and you can create banners you can reorder passage you can reorder filters you can do any promotions you want.
rep,so there’s a lot more comprehensive merchandising tool as well.
rep,does that make sense owen.
rep,right so as i told you ill send you the implementations doc if you just want to just pass italong ill tell you the roi and ill also send you the report we’ve set for you.
rep,look at it let me know if you want us to reconnect early next week im happy to set up a call on monday or tuesday. if you have the approval i can send you the contract and we can just start from the 1st of august.
prospect,is it possible to send the contract with everything else you send so i can review it and refer it to when i present to them.
prospect,okay yeah no take your time.
rep,right and can we reconnect on monday or you do you have any availability for monday for a quick 15 minute chat.
prospect,yeah monday is good.
rep,so monday i’ll set up something for 10 in the morning.
rep,you’re at you’re in central time or eastern.
prospect,eastern .
rep,eastern right.
rep,okay ill set it up at 10am est and if you feel everything is good till then we can then go ahead and discuss.
rep,okay wonderful talking to you thanks for the opportunity and look forward to hopefully work with you soon.
prospect,yeah hopefully thank you.
rep,thank you have a great weekend ahead.
rep,bye bye .
rep,have a segment and target tool as well for both segmentation and personalization on both sides action so that's the whole gamut we cover.
rep,however this presentation i've primarily prepared for site search most of the machine learning elements would remain the same and apply across all our products but i'm happy to spend time and talk about the other products as well.
rep,just thought i will give you a context.
rep,does that work for you both?
rep,ok.   so this was a quick high-level agenda i had prepared for today i wanted to spend a minute or two just to talk about who we are and what we do. then what i've done is i've done a quick site search audit for digi-key today and i've tried drawing some parallels with similar customers that we work so that you get an apples to apples comparison and then we can talk talk specifics about the technology behind that and the other features on the product and some of the other verticals that we cater to as well right. so that was a high level agenda so it should essentially take me about 45-50 minutes to go through the entire deck but feel free to stop me if you have any questions.
rep,before we get started i just had two quick questions i wanted to know which ecommerce platform you're on today and do you use anybody for site search or is it more built in solr.
rep,okay both are home grown okay good to know.
rep,so this is who we are as i told you we are in the bay area headquartered in mountain view we also have an office in chicago.
rep,and an international operations in bangalore.
rep,a seven-year-old company worked with about 120 retail brands power about 1200 global sites have success in every vertical we work with express rue 21 just started working ann taylor loft hsn the fashion in the marketplaces. worked with ib supply a b2b manufacturer or milwaukee worked with us auto parts warehouse foreign container in the parts in our best base. worked with hh greg in electronics fresh direct in pharmacy ashley bed bath in home improvement so it's kind of demonstrated our solution works pretty well irrespective of whichever vertical that we deal with in retail.
rep,and the solution is completely platform agnostic.
rep,it could be a home grown platform like you have today or even if you have to move to an enterprise platform it could be a atg or websphere or ____ later the solution will have no impact will not get impacted by just changing the platform.
rep,so this is typically who we are.
rep,so the one of the key roles that i play in the company is (a) i talk to a lot of retailers like yourself and i also work very closely with my product team so that we're building the right set of feature set for all our private suite and for us search has always been a core component because probably 24 months ago a lot of retailers had probably between 10 and 20 percent of their overall traffic on site search but today some of some of the retailers we work with have close to 50% or 60% of the traffic on search.
rep,and what we've traditionally observed is a site search as a component is generally the conversions rate are sometimes 2x or even 3x via normal site search site conversions.
rep,so search essentially contributes to 50% of your business in most cases so search is an extremely critical component for every retailer today and our solution and our core relevancy strength privately differentiates us from everybody else out there.
rep,we are a sass platform but we do guarantee five lines of availability we have fronted by a cdn and we guarantee a sub 300 millisecond response time irrespective of where the user is across the country.
rep,because your businesses could be very unique and the behavior of your customers could also be very unique so we have a poc model where we could come in and implement this solution in the four to six weeks and then we let you use the product for the remaining six weeks so that you see actually how the search performs for you and we guarantee you a ten percent lift in conversions within the first 90 days.
rep,you see that lift in conversions you see that business impact you like working with our team and then you could continue with us for a contract or if you don't see the impact you can walk away no questions asked so this way you get to test the product before you actually buy it.
prospect,that does sound fair.
rep,and the confidence primarily comes from stacey david is because we've seen the success across every vertical and every retailer we've work with we see numbers as high as 50-60 % lift if the search was very very bad or even on cases where people have worked immensely on search especially solr instances we've still been able to demonstrate a fairly significant impact right.
rep,what i could do is after this presentation i would also send you a case study that we prepared recently with id supply. they roughly do about a hundred million dollars online based out of milwaukee and some of the numbers there's something that you would talk to refer to and happy to organize a call as to how we made a difference to them.
rep,so this is this is the approach that we take towards implementation right.
rep,so now let me get into some of these use cases and when i worked on these use cases i've tried to mimic your customers behavior in terms of how do he or she actually finds products from your site what is the current experience today and what is that we could do differently so that i could present an opportunity snapshot for you.
rep,and i start with autosuggest which is your first interaction with you search system for any of the customers generally we want the auto suggest to be guided it should be visual it should try and mimic the experience a person might have going in your store if you had a physical store when they go initially they'll want to go to a specific aisle then they want to look at specific options they want to see products which are visual so that is what we try to create with some of our templates.
rep,so today when i look at digikey.com
rep,i do not see an auto suggest option right that is something that i thought was an opportunity for us to look at and i'll take you to some of these live sites so that you get some perspective on what we have built for some of our customers i'll try and stick to closer to your vertical at the same time i'll show you some of the options we have built for other verticals as well so that you get a depth of the customizations we could bring it right. this is one customer parts warehouse again which was based roughly about 30 million dollars in online business they had a two specific behavior instances with their customers one was a customer who exactly knew which part number to buy and another customer was somebody who did not know the part number to buy so before they came on to us they've been with us for the last two years now two and a half years i guess. so they had two search boxes one search box to find a part number and one search box for a modeling search but managing two search instances became complicated the relevancy got skewed so what we did is (a) we built them a part finder where you can essentially find any part in three clicks and from a search experience what we did is today if i pick up the first thing here the cell i start looking for the cell one side you would see parts one side you would see model names and then we see top searches for that specific query this was one of the instances we get. now if you move to an auto manufacturer these guys sell a lot of auto parts based in connecticut and for them if i start looking for say a mirror the way they have built an auto suggest experience is they want to first identify which brand that you want a mirror for and then as you hover around they essentially have products available and you can actually add products to cart right from the search box.
rep,so that's another experience we've built for this retailer.
rep,and if you go to a different vertical say grocery  the reason i thought i'd show this to you is because you might also have instances people might not come to your site just to buy one product they might buy more than one product and in grocery that that is a classic used case.
rep,people generally buy 30- 40 products in a single transaction so to buy a large number of products you end up doing a lot of clicks (a) they wanted a quick add cart option like the auto manufacturer you saw and this is a large retailer they do about two million dollars in online revenue they're the large distance south east asia and for them if i start looking for chicken the way we've built the auto suggest experience for them is essentially you can change products quantity and add products to cart right from the search box we also personalized it where depending on your zip code you can actually show an offer for that zip code and then you can also see all the commonly searched terms your popular brands and categories.
prospect,no not for me.
rep,right and in apparel we can actually up the level of personalization here for somebody like an express the way we've built an experience for them if i start looking for jeans as a product we have (a) a guided navigation of jeans for women jeans for men and as you hover around images change and then we can also have a segmentation block where depending on the location that you're coming from whichever is the most popular color in the application we can also have different styles in that color and then the top keywords as well so it's more visual and guided for the customer.
rep,so these are some of the experiences we've built for some of the customers we work.
rep,ok so the next experience i wanted to talk about was your ability to do error corrections in most instances especially if you've done something on solr or elastic search what you essentially end up doing is try and create a list of synonyms for most of you misspelled words or your stemmed words it could be even simple things like singular and plural.
rep,it works if you have a hundred products or a thousand products to sell but when your skew count becomes fairly large then it becomes a challenge right.
rep,one of the things we have done is since (a) its our machine learning platform the way we have built our machine learning platform is we've actually trained the platform on over 200 million products in the e-commerce space so that it understands the context of what people are looking for and then we've trained it on every vertical so the the machine learning platform knows that when somebody looks for a black leather jacket in an apparel space or an 18-ounce 2% nonfat milk in a grocery space what does the exact context of the search means and it's being trained to auto correct itself up to six words misspelt in a single query like i just dropped a single letter or changed a single letter for a resistor or a capacitor essentially none of the product showed up right.
rep,you could like this is something that we built for ib-supply you misspell nebulizer you misspell filter  (a) it'll autocorrect and it'll also show you results in the word go and then similarly in express you could butcher all the three words black leather jacket as i've misspelt it right here it'll auto correct itself to black leather jacket for your products and again you don't have to do this manually the system does it automatically for more than 99% of the cases all of this is solved out of box.
rep,any questions on this.
prospect,i mean it looks like an interesting auto-completion system have you done this with highly technical products like ours which you were there's a lot of part numbers and things like that.
rep,yeah actually david if you look at the us auto us auto actually has 2.4 million
rep,parent products parents skus and have a lot of variations to it.
rep,so the overall products sku count that we're looking at with all the variances comes to about 180 million so we've managed to scale to that kind of volume and you have a lot of smaller sized retailers as well like ib-supply like ib-supply has about 450000 skus bed bath has about 6000 skus though its not technical but ib-supply some of the products can get a little technical and then there is ___ container some of these are fairly technical instances and same with ss396 they also have a million parts that we deal with.
rep,and and today i'm not sure if you're using elastic search or solr is it manually updated for all these synonyms and spell checks.
rep,no no today is the experience that you try to be like essentially for any spelling mistake do you do this manually do you input all the variations manually.
rep,do do we do this manual you're asking.
prospect,we don't have any kind of or complete do we stacey.
rep,no no not for ___ for spell checks david.
rep,like in this example if i misspelled the word register so essentially unless you've built something manually  there's no way to auto correct itself is that correct.
prospect,hey stacey do we do anything with misspellings.
prospect,no no no i don't think we do.
rep,okay sorry the intent was not to put you in a spot but it's fine if you don't know.
rep,and another thing i want to talk about stacy david was you know the stemmed words right things like accessory versus  accessories the results shown were completely different because if but if you look at it as a user my intent is not changing this was just one simple example i pulled up but the intent here is i could spell anyway i want a like it could be a singular word or a plural word or things like wood wooden center central essentially the user intent is not changing so the experience that you show should also not change like i've tried using some snapshots.
rep,like this was an apparel example but like t-shirt can be spelt in so many different ways but the user intent is not changing so the results that you show should also not change.
rep,so this is again something that we automate and you don't have to do anything manually on this.
rep,that's another snapshot i wanted to show.
rep,and the third things was primarily from an infrastructure standpoint again as i told you since we're fronted by a cdn we guarantee you a sub-300 millisecond response time and in a quick speed test on digi-key today i just wanted to search for a capacitor generally takes about five to six seconds for that search results page to load that is something that we could help you with because (a) we are a sass platform and (b) we are fronted by a cdn and we've done this test for all our customers.
rep,even on a black friday it will load up within 300 milliseconds irrespective of where your user is across the country.
rep,this is another benefit that we get with the cloud solution.
rep,and lastly it's about relevancy again as with relevancy the core logic has been in we building out this machine learning platform and making it contextually aware to the entire e-commerce landscape and then another thing that we tried doing is also identify how people find products online today.
rep,there are broadly about 12 ways people look for information in a site like yours people might be coming by an exact searching for an exact product name or a part number in say an apparel site people might be searching by a specific feature or the specific theme say cocktail dresses or formal trousers in electronics we've seen people use a lot of linguistics short fits like a 42 inch television the word inch could be replaced by double quotes or people today are so used to finding information on google's that we see a lot of natural language search right people might be looking for something on sale people might want to do some non product searches where they want to look at your returns policy shipping policy and they want them redirect to the right sections of website and then you don't have to do any of this manually our system automates most of these experiences it's not that we solved for the relevancy 100% but we know about 90% accurate for most of these use cases.
rep,then i'll take you through some of them as we build on right so these are some of the issues i found and these are some of the top keywords that i found on google like conversion calculator i did not see any result i look for a resistor color code calculator i did not see any result i looked for a circuit diagram maker this is there whenever your documentation i did not find a result then i looked for some specific use cases where i know this is this is manufactured in the apem i'm looking for a specific push-button switch but when i search for it it does not take them to that exact product page nor it takes me to a page where it actually shows me ok there are these 10-15 things available.
rep,it's doing a text pattern match its pulling up everything was just loosely relevant to a switch or a push-button or apem as a brand and it's giving me a large result set to review.
rep,this is something that might impact customer experience on the site which is what if we could help you and i'll show you some these case of what we've done and and then i did a similar one i specifically looked for a "digi international computer single board" probably this is this or something similar is what i wanted to look at but again i go i have to go through a large result set to narrow my search narrow my experience to the exact product i wanted.
rep,this is one of the experience i saw and then finally i looked for the slide potentiometer you actually have a nice practically navigation where you show me all these but when i search for it is where the issue is because you show me a bunch of other things then i have to click on this to actually get into this.
rep,so these are some of the experiences i could see that can be optimized.
rep,i'm pretty sure you're aware of all these so just thought i'll see where the opportunity is for us.
rep,any comments under this.
prospect,no they're very good examples.
rep,alright and i'll also walk you through.
rep,sorry david please go ahead.
prospect,you've done a good job of doing your homework.
rep,thank you that's my job.
rep,but yeah what i'll do is i'll also take you through some of the use cases we have solved for it it's easy to point issues with anybody site but it's not very easy to solve for it.
rep,some of the things we've tried doing like i've tried using some parallel examples like black logitech wireless keyboard or i look for a very specific exact product as i look for a bright air sixteen point two ounce spray bottle right so for you to show the right results you have to understand the context of what the user is looking for and we do a fairly reasonable good job on that.
rep,i'll show you some more examples right again this isn't apparel but the reason i showed you this example is because it's so specific i'm specifically looking for a full sleeves office wear for women so (a) should get into a category then its should looking for a specific theme and then it's looking for a specific product but it still shows up the right results so that's simply what i want to show you here and then we also solve for part number matches pretty well you don't have to have the exact part number mentioned even a partial part number will give you options and while you're actually typing the part number it will actually start showing you options in an auto suggests functionality itself so that you really don't have to go through a complete search experience to find the product.
rep,and and we have a great indexing speed so indexing and relevancy is our core strengths we mix about 5000 products a second and we can consume a fairly large catalog and index them in the right way.
rep,if i could ask what would be the potential sku count we could be looking at if we have to work with digikey. is it over a million skus or is it under a million skus.
prospect,5 million parts.
rep,5 million ok.
rep,okay that's a good number right and then some examples on non-products such as the intent here is like if i click on returns i click on about us i click on order status ideally it should redirect me to the exact page and that is what we do all these are automated redirects unless you want to overwrite them manually.
rep,and then we also do compatibility searches just as an example and we also solve for natural language things like "some product on sale" will also in most cases give you the right results.
rep,so the relevancy is a lot more contextual that way.
rep,yeah so another thing that i did notice obviously you have a lot of filters like one of the customers we work with ib-supply for example in the mid-segment space they have close to 6000 filters for their 400000 skus.
rep,(a) we give you the ability to define faceting for every category even for an every subcategory (a) say for casual shoes you can define filter you can define attributes in the way you want and then as a user i can come and search for casual shoes men's casual shoes women's casual shoes men's nike men's adidas the results will appear in the same order of attributions and then it's dynamic because if we figure that say an ankle height is more clicked filter than size then ankle height automatically moves up on top.
rep,you don't have to do this manually we can do this automatically alright.
rep,similarly it works for casual shirts as well and then then finally on zero results pages the reason i put up this slide is to show the users some call to action instead of showing the sorry message with a blank page show them some recommendation widgets it could be recently viewed it could be your top sellers so that the user has some call to action to do instead of actually staring at a blank page so that was another suggestion i had. any questions so far.
rep,great so and david just a quick reference document on how we do this from a technology standpoint these are the five things we do for every query that is inputted by a search box and i'll take you through what we do in each of these things.
rep,the first thing that we do is something called as semantic relevance because today essentially most search systems deal with this problem where they're probably doing an anding or they're doing an oring or they're doing a minimal match right.
rep,the problem with this approach is that either you show too many products or you to show too few products or you probably show irrelevant products and then we'll have to manually merchandise these queries to actually solve for it right.
rep,so i've just taken an example i know its in the apparel space but to give you some context right say there's a query like women's white jeans this is essentially how it'll show up because most systems use this rule called tf-idf which either gives your popularity score or a rarity score what we have done is we've added something called as usefulness score because as per tf/idf if you look at the score it designs for women white and jeans it gives the maximum score to white then to women then to jeans.
rep,so we add something called as relevant screen of usefulness score to all of to the idf score and hence we are able to start promoting products in the right way so we essentially displace products and bury them which are not relevant so that's the first stage that we do when we call it a semantic relevance.
prospect,i have a question idf is invoice inverse frequency.
rep,so this is how you know google uses this this was an algorithm which was built in the 70s even google uses the same algorithm but the problem is it's good for document search but it is not good for e-commerce search because in e-commerce the context to be very different like the example i told you here.
rep,so this is the first step that we do right the second step what what we do is we start doing exclusions right again the top is not a jeans so we start excluding the top and replacing that by jeans right once you do the stage 2 the third is we start adding machine learning behavior right so we what the first thing that we do when we start our implementation is to install our analytics and we start reading through clickstream data so that we understand how how people are actually buying products in your site right.
rep,so based on that click stream data we come up with a product user behavior score and then we assign score for each product so that we go which product is actually most popular right.
rep,and then finally we also look for any merchandising rules that you might have done.
rep,one distinct difference that we have against an endeca or anybody else is when you do a apply a boosting rule it ap- which applies to the entire catalog what we do is we restrict the boosting rule for that query so that if you heavily boost a product it does not show up in all the irrelevant places it only shows up within the category so that is something that we do.
rep,and then finally we also add personalization to the entire behavior personalization is where we can start doing segmentation we can do segmentation by geo if your parts change for store location if stores is where you deliver the product from so you know you want to only show products which are actually available in the inventory you can actually do segmentation by geo then you can actually do segmentation by channel if you are actually spending money on your ppc campaigns and on your email campaigns you want to make sure that you also create something for people who are landing to your site from those campaigns so we help you to segmentation by geo right and we can also do segmentation by user type new user versus repeat user what kind of products you want to show to them.
rep,essentially six broad segments which we can help you target right and this is like a high level architecture we have built the entire platform on adobe scene we have essentially hacked onto scene and essentially built all these four components over the top of it which makes us very different from what people would have built using the solr or an elastic search and researcher.
rep,and it's a lot of information that i spilt out just thought i'll you a quick context of how we do this.
rep,any questions on this david and stacy.
prospect,not for me.
prospect,david's the data science guy.
prospect,its interesting.
rep,i hope you found it useful though.
prospect,yeah i find your presentation very impressive you did a very very good job of pulling us together very impressively.
rep,okay thank you sir.
rep,and beyond this all these are automated functionalities i spoke about but we also understand you understand your business better than us so we also have a back-end dashboard especially for your merchandising team and also for data sciences team to actually come and look at reporting and we've made it extremely comprehensive right this is a quick iv view of the dashboard this is where you can manage multiple sub-domains you might have or if you have a different environment for staging for production you know essentially manage everything from single console.
rep,this is essentially where you can go and set user access rights like what different people with different titles can actually see different sections on the dashboard and this gives you an executive summary so this gives you all your number of search queries for product you use your add to carts and orders we have a dashboard similar to this like for our product recommendation also for a category navigation as well and then this gives you a high level metrics and then you can go and drill down in fairly comprehensive reporting in the search dashboard you can go and look for reporting on search and also for your auto compute as well and this gives the first section gives you high level reporting.
rep,sorry my site is a little internet a little slow today.
rep,sorry about that.
rep,so this gives you a high overview this you can look at all your search heads you can compare it with any metric you want to and it gives you the top metrics like which is your top search queries your zero results your clicked products your ordered products all this can be downloaded into a csv and can be reviewed and then we do the __ we also give you individual query reporting where you can actually go and drill down the every single query on your site and see how each query is performing like if dress is an important query here you can now go down by and drill down for this query dress look at all the business metrics associated with this query and then see how is this query performing in the products associated to them.
rep,so if this week if this query is going 3.26%
rep,conversion and last week this was actually doing thre- was probably doing four percent you can now go and see which are the products which have gone out of inventory because of which the performance of this query dropped like we have done this for a query you can on our category dashboard you can also do it for every single product as well.
rep,and then you can also look at similar reports for your auto fin as well your in-future your keyword suggestion your top queries popular products however you've constructed it it'll give you a matrix on all the autosuggest options as well right.
rep,and then finally we have a merchandising dashboard this is like if your merchandisers have used endeca experience manager it has all the functionalities of an endeca experience manager but is probably 100 less complicated than that it's more of a 2017 dashboard right.
rep,i have a quick video which i can do which i think will do more justice to this.
rep,just play that video so it's more easier and covers all the sections.
rep,this is a high level dashboard you can go and create custom landing pages you can create the campaigns everything that you want to do for every query and every category as well.
rep,you can define a campaign you can have a specific start date and end date for any campaign you want to create and once you've created that you can go ahead and start defining an audience for that campaign right. and this audience is where i spoke about the segmentation you can specifically create a campaign for your new users for your repeat users. you can create a campaign for a specific device type people are coming in from your desktop versus mobile you can clear the campaign for people coming from a specific geography today you can actually go and drill down by a slip code and then you can also create a campaign for a very specific channel right.
rep,and then as you start selecting your segmentation logic it will also give you an indicator as to what's the potential reach of this campaign okay and once you've chosen your audience a different marketing teams might have different ideas so what we've also done is built an a/b test feature within the dashboard where if team a has idea a and team b has idea b they can essentially test do a live a/b test and decide the winner by say clicks or conversions whatever metric you want to follow so so that you're more certain as to what actually make sense to you guys right.
rep,and once you've defined all this now you can go and merchandise you can do boosting you can do slotting.
rep,you can do sorting or you can do pinning and again all of them can be a simple drag drop feature and as you keep creating the rules it will start showing you a preview of all the actions you are actually taking on the dashboard and then you can essentially review that before you actually go ahead and publish it.
rep,i'm sorry for information overload but i just wanted to cover all the elements of the tool.
rep,stacey do you have a specific tool that you've built in-house to manage merchandising today.
prospect,well our we are sitecore for our few pages and so we're just getting started using their personalization.
rep,i think our biggest differentiator from most of the other partners of that is because we do product discovery end to end.
rep,we also help you with site search we can help you with product recommendations we can power your category pages and we have a merchandising dashboard so that it's more easier for you to essentially run everything with the same vendor but again you can also use it __ cart you can still use it just for search and use somebody else for any other tools so you're both the options available.
rep,so yeah this was a quick snapshot on the merchandising dashboard.
rep,this was like a high-level tour of the entire product so just wanted to stop answer any questions and then get into the implementation bit.
rep,and david and stacey your pricing is based on the number of search sessions if you just look at a search product and it is based on the overall site sessions if you're looking at the entire product discovery product line that we're talking about right.
rep,and as i told you we have a poc model you don't have to see give us any commitment till you actually see the revenue optics we can come in i'll discuss about the implementation approaches as well we could come in and integrate the solution in four to six weeks and then generally we keep it a very low cost for the poc usually under ten thousand dollars so that you and this is primarily the actual cost towards incur and integration and you could test the product out three months and see if it'll make sense and as i told you we guarantee you a ten percent uptake in conversions you don't see that uptick you can walk away no questions asked.
prospect,that would be great because i think the piece here thats important from us you know i would need to share with our it team.
rep,and i'll also send you an implementation of those documents we can do implementation in two ways because if today you're using solr or elastic search we can mimic the same response that the solr is given today of your application or your elastic search is giving to your application so that it will be a very simple integration it's a simple api that we'll build out we'll give you the api you'll just have to integrate that or we can also do an in page ajax kind of a model where you create a page give us your header footer and an empty <div> tag and we can do html injection and we can build all the conflicts on our end.
rep,so irrespective in each of these cases either of these cases actually we can go live in four weeks and then you would have two months to test the product out to see if you're actually getting a business impact out of this.
rep,just a quick question stacey in terms of how the year has been planned out for you guys is there a window available for us to do a poc this year.
prospect,i don't know that would be something i would need to talk to it with.
rep,again as i told you the intent is to involve as little of your time as possible.
rep,we can technically if especially if you choose the in-page ajax approach all we need from you is your catalog about an hour of your developers time to install our analytics and then once the entire configuration is put in a staging platform a few days of your developers time to do testing that's about it.
rep,we will do all the work at our end and then you can either do an a/b test just to see a side-by-side comparison you can push 50% of your traffic on your existing infrastructure and the remaining 50% on in box and and see if we are at least 10 percent better at a minimum compared to your existing system so you can actually do that.
prospect,you did a very nice presentation i liked that you used our site for example.
rep,thank you so much and do you want us to schedule a follow-up call in about a week or two weeks to discuss if there is a feasibility for us to do a poc in the next quarter or the third quarter of the year.
rep,do you think that's okay.
prospect,i would say for me i david and i should probably have a conversation first i should probably share that document with somebody from my team and so i think i wouldn't set anything up yet.
prospect,you're welcome to check back with us say and i would give it three weeks because i know myself i'm traveling the next two weeks.
prospect,i'm going to florida and then i'm just traveling here in minnesota.
rep,thank you so much.
rep,hello.  how are you
prospect,wait the second please.
prospect,how the volume was turning off and here right now is just me here pc will join us soon and.
prospect,because it's floren.
rep,yes floorin this is monall how are you.
rep,i'm fine thank you how are you.
rep,okay sir it's been some time since we've talked.
prospect,yeah he's been quite a long time and right now we have a couple of things to do and we're pretty busy.
rep,got it so flooring maybe from my perspective i just wanted to check in real quick from a business aspect of it where do we stand i just wanted to double check that our team is doing what they need to do to help you guys and this is moving forward as you are expecting i know there are some delays in the catalog piece for both sides so i just wanted to make sure we're still okay we'll still don't track.
prospect,right now as i've said we are preparing for the black friday which will be on 20 november.
rep,oh you guys also do black friday.
rep,right after thanksgiving.
prospect,before after i don't know when is thanks giving.
rep,thanksgiving is the 26th .
prospect,yeah we are before it so 20 no no.
rep,20th november friday got it interesting.
prospect,yes and we also have a big campaign from for our department to something like thursday which is search week actually yes actually a branding campaign so next week we'll have this on our website and we do a lot of things for this and our all our resources are going there right now i have two teams actually three teams but one of those is one and team and we have someone former search and listing and another team for recommendations and initially we were thinking about starting with a search from foreman box but we've changed our mind and we want to first to test the recommendation system and basically the other team know if you are in the skype skype group they've already started to work on this but to be to be some it will take a while until we can do this which posts we can start working full on this after the black friday after before you will also have some big campaigns a mock day i don't know national day of romania on the first of december and also the quiz.
prospect,sorry.
rep,what's that first day the biggest day romania called.
prospect,national day or national day for the 1st december yeah and yeah we we have to split our resources in order to have everything covered and we don't have such such a big number of members in those things and that's right we are moving a little bit slow only so this part now .
rep,no problem floorin so there were five pieces i wanted to share from my side so one was the feed upload has completed i just wanted to understand you know is there a frequency with which the catalogue has been sent and are you happy with what that it that looks like the feed with which the catalog is being updated etc.
prospect,yeah i'm aware of this they all left in work on this but we do see some feedback from your team we need to exclude some bull br stuff from there and he can do that now but soon he will support this yeah i know what how the output will be updated i'm aware of this it's okay for us also i'm the skype group where alex from the other team is working on for the recommendation system and i notice there that shan.
prospect,akahs commit.
prospect,yeah they are discussing there and this is somehow their job to do this i mean the developers power developers and everything is a use okay for us yeah.
rep,perfect and i i think i'm sure you were probably made aware that you're working on the the development and testing the modifier that you guys can call from an api perspective it should be ready sometime middle of next week and we're also working on the relevancy tuning on our end which would be ready the week after so during the week of that thanks get your thanksgiving or i should say your black friday during that week we should be ready with that all as well so we're working in parallel to just make sure that everything is happening in parallel the last piece was that based on what you know now and some of the campaigns are working what is some tentative timeline that you might want to see and test this would this be sometime in december i'm assuming after national day.
prospect,more likely january.
rep,january got it okay.
rep,i just want to make sure that.
prospect,yeah because uh at the moment we have an internal discussion whether to move some of our applications and how we can do the stuff here to have better better response on the website and things like this and there isn't a big internal discussion about this.
prospect,so small you know.
rep,flowing the last piece that i had and i'll let you go because i know you're busy is the analytics that alex and team must be integrating the analytics any guidance on when that will be done so that our team can also verify and get that going.
prospect,i can i don't know a seconds right now but i can make a follow-up and come back to you with an update.
rep,yeah that's and that's fine i just wanted to make sure that we from our perspective whatever the feed changes that have been requests are in the analytics those are the two key pieces that we want to make sure are in place so that we can do a lot of tuning because what's the analytics goes in we'll be able to capture a lot of the user behaviour data and you want to make sure that we start seeing that and making sure understanding and tuning <>.
prospect,now regarding the istick sure we can send you one a history of some of our events site such as add to cart click on the product and we are sending those events to other other you know how to call them.
prospect,vendor for example and they use them in order to give us some thing on the website.
rep,part of this analytics flooring that should get captured i believe that if the analytics gets deployed completely then we will automatically start getting this data so that should be that should take care of that so that's perfect i just wanted to make sure that that's a critical piece for us too that a lot of other things hinges on and and i understand you guys have big campaigns coming up i'll also make a point to check it out on black friday to make sure i can see if something on sale do you do international shipping flooring
rep,no now 20 million and the rules are represented in a bulgaria hungary and poland.
rep,got it keep it for me when i come visit you i want that sale.
rep,okay.  just kidding i'll buy it and provide your office address just keep it i'll pick it up when there up romania.
rep,that will be awesome.
rep,or if you guys are visiting us or india either way you know yeah so floorin i also wanted to check in is dana available anytime today is she gonna be.
prospect,next week this week is in is on vacation and he'll come back next week he is responsible for the recommendation part i'm more responsible for this first part.
prospect,right now the recommendation team is taking this into their hands the search team was working on a feed upload and now the initial team are taking the project and starting started to work for to understand this patient regarding the feed analytics and what we need to send you in order to have everything covered on our website.
rep,got it perfect.
prospect,dana is more aware at this moment regarding the resources they have and recommendation team yeah.
rep,but she is on vacation this week yeah.
she's on vacation yeah.
rep,alright no problem alright floorin i guess i'll let you go that's all i wanted to just do a quick check-in from a business perspective if i want to make sure we're not happy for any reason that our team was not doing what they were supposed to do that you had a chance to tell me but it seems like everything is going forward as you expect and the post teams are cranking this out.
prospect,yeah we had some thing to solve here our internal garland say like this and right now we will focus more on unboxed and yeah we need to have the explanation as soon as possible on our website and after that we'll continue with the search but for the recommendation yeah .
rep,so i will i will share that with the to make sure that they know that right the recommendation has to be as soon as possible and i'm pretty sure that analytics will be pretty easy to give recommendations up and running i think we can get going also they'll be fantastic but i'll let my team now focus on recommendations and then search we gotta get recommendations up and running as quickly as possible so figure out a way to help eman team however we can to get that going.
prospect,yep we had an internal meeting regarding the unboxd how we'll see the further and we spoke about the analytics as i've said before and if you can send us what exactly do you need from what type of events you need to have in order to give us some recommendations based on the user activity on our website we have some can send you a history of them just to have them and we also can add the google analytics vanities on our website script for analytics in order to track from now on.
rep,great because you have tremendous amount of traffic on the site the historical data is good to have but it's not necessarily a requirement so i don't necessarily create work for you guys but let me check with my team if the history is important and if you can share that's fantastic i don't wanna necessarily create work but if you deploy the analytics beforehand going forward and in a couple of days i think depending on the traffic we should be able to start providing recommendations.
prospect,oh that's great.
rep,yeah the key is to just make sure that it's deployed correctly you can fire all the events or capture all the events fire and on the site and the catalog piece as long as those two pieces are taking care of the recommendations api alex should be able to sort of call them and be able to very quickly get them give them an isolated so i'll i'll give my team a heads up them know that this is a very high priority and and to support and focus on that and then once that's figured out we'll take care of search as the next step.
prospect,that's great i've also i speak with alex regarding the an idml website and see all the things are going there and if you are saying that in the couple of days you have everything you need from our data in order to have a clinician that's great we are estimating somewhere about i don't one month one week more than one week of history or events in on the website and that's why we weren't thinking about history events.
rep,right so i think you know it depends because i remember you do have a lot of traffic.
rep,we would you just need to cover a certain threshold of traffic and i believe that that amount of traffic should be covered within a couple of days so but let me double-check with my team well i'll definitely let them know that surgical data is available but based on the traffic that you guys have if if you collect all this data going forward do we need to create work because i don't want to create work for your team either i know you already have the data and you might have the process ready to go but i just want to not necessarily get into something where just by deploying analytics and just by waiting for two days we can get what we need that should be good enough for us.
prospect,okay that's great.
rep,yeah awesome so flooring any any other questions any other complaints any anything else that you want to share.
prospect,no we can we can establish a new meeting next week when donna will be a back to work and we can give you more details of how we'll proceed i was with her regarding this and we'll make a plan a roadmap and we can give you a more fair estimation about how we see the things going and when we estimate that we will have on unboxd on our website is not okay with you.
rep,that's absolutely fair so what would you try to do flooring is maybe monday or tuesday of next week we'll try to reach out and see because i'm sure dana will come back from vacation she'll be bombarded with stuff to do so check in we'll try to schedule something towards the end of the week just like this and then if not the fall early following week and then we'll do another check-in and quickly see where we stand .
rep,awesome fantastic thank you sir for it i really appreciate it hopefully it was not too late for you so thank you for your time.
prospect,it's okay for me don't delay thank you for the time and uh for the good care.
rep,ya no problem and flooring at any given point in time you feel that you're not getting what you need from our team don't hesitate to let me know okay.
prospect,yeah sure thank you very much.
rep,because you're not you're not getting anybody then focus on what .
prospect,yeah all right awesome.
prospect,thank you also all right i don't know what is the evening night.
rep,it is morning for me thank you thank you okay thank you very much.
rep,hi <> can you hear me right now this is prasanth here.
prospect,<> fine yeah.
rep,yeah so i will i'll ping you a file name it's called log4j dot properties this file will be in your classes folder or may be in isola home or you know put me in your tommcatt bin i saw it tomcat cons folder can you try to find this file long4j dot properties.
prospect,there's a log4j - 1.
prospect,2 that went for that jar but that's the only thing that has log4j in it.
rep,okay then then i get <> oh you know what sandy what you can do is i can share you a sample log4j properties file you will have to do is you will have to paste this property file in your live directory right so i guess if you're using tomcat then you have you know tomcat relapse your solar application folder and you know within that we'll have a web - and in it i can send you the instructions you will have to copy a paste that file over there and restart the system so.
prospect,yeah if you get something over there because do you also have any documentation on what involved in how the solar connector works so that i could send that to our developers.
rep,yeah so i also we will shared that and you know we will definitely share the <> is a pretty small simple way of actually doing that so what we do is you know on if you using solar will give the response in the exactly the same formula solar gives right so you know so your developer would not have to re-integrate our apis this is what to point out solar to unbox to our api this scene though you are in.
rep,so that's how simple should be but we'll definitely say that.
rep,also is it possible for you to in a screen share and show your existing server you know login to server where ever you can be sure that you know you know how your deployment is if you do point on that then you know so we are very sure that it will work or not.
prospect,i'm sorry you you want me to share the screen right now.
rep,if you share  the screen right now and you know you can log in to you you know this server where you're deployed solar.
prospect,i think you have to make me the presenter to share my screen do you think i'll be able to.
rep,so you are running it on windows os is it.
prospect,correct yep.
rep,alright okay so can you go to your tomcat folder right you are the.
prospect,you are the apache one.
rep,ya that's one.
rep,that should be the one you know so no this is not the one i get this is i don't think this one  are you able to find where your tomcats folder right now.
prospect,you know if that's not the folder i'm not sure where it would be.
rep,okay this is not doesn't look so yes it should be solar home it should be there yes.
prospect,is that where you'd want to go.
rep,yeah yes.
rep,go to the docs folder i think its skully skully lite like that should be the one you go to the web-ins lib you can go to the web-ins yes that's the one yeah click on lib okay so we'll share you the way we can you know share you a property file you have to put put the property file in this folder.
rep,and restart the service.
prospect,and restart the server okay restart the service.
rep,so we share the instructions of what we'll do is we just try to replicate this in our windows and walkman are you using very old version of solar which is 1.4
rep,so you just be you know doubly sure do you know to take this before we.
rep,and the property folder that will create log files so within the properties folder and within the properties you know logging log homes your property file which will get they will be a part where the logs will be created so you will have to create a folder and you know and pass that you know folder path in that property file we share an instruction in the document.
rep,okay yeah and i think that's all from our side this should work so just just one you know before you know and use it could you help me with do you have i saw the typing site skully and skully live so i assume that one of them is the staging server and one of them is a production side is that right.
prospect,the regular skully one is <>.
rep,okay and you need both on the same tomcat service is it.
prospect,i believe so yeah.
rep,okay that was just one thing you know just in case something goes wrong we don't have a service to it the same tomcat server so i mean just the probably fire nothing should go wrong okay we will share you the instructions the steps.
rep,thanks andy thanks.
rep,all right awesome so i just want to make sure so two things one you want to deploy quickly and obviously cost was another factor so what i wanted to address is that correct those are the two.
rep, it would be more accurate to say deploy efficiently when we are ready in the horizon in other words right now it's not a good time for us for deployment but we will want to deploy quickly some point at some point in the future.
rep,well i wouldn't even say as the person who's going to be hook for putting this out it's not deploying quickly the level of effort associated with deploying .
rep, on our end.
rep,  so what i what i would need to understand is okay this is what we have to do this is what has to change this is all of the details that we would need to try to implement those types of things it would be my resources doing that so what i need to do is fully understand what it would look like to try to put that together i think it also comes out of my budget.
rep, yes yes.
rep, so well so concern but you know that's also one of those things like once you understand what it cost then you figure it out.
rep, and i assume tim when you say cost is a concern it's more the deployment cost or is it the the unbxd product cost a monthly cost or both.
rep, so deployment costs i do look at more not necessarily in terms of dollars but in man-hours <> and the resources that i have to allocate so we're an internal development shop right so we have expectations that our customers which is sparkfun has levied against us that we have to try to hit so adding this as an effort means that other things are going to be slipping and right now before fourth quarter you know when we've got targets that we're trying to hit this is stuff that we have to do by the middle of november i don't have resources to associate with something necessarily products are it's not a lot of resources so that's why i don't know if we're necessarily saying oh we're going to try to do this and implement it before november i think we're like oh what would it take in so today we're gonna we're gonna do this in fourth quarter for a first quarter implementation.
rep, gotcha so it won't be necessarily talking about hitting it before november but sometime fourth quarter so that sometime in the first quarter of next year you can actually deploy.
rep, turn it by yeah.
rep, okay that's perfectly fair and i i wasn't necessarily suggesting that we do a quick deployment just for the sake of deployment to cover the holiday season we were we were looking at from both perspective to say if we were to come up with a way that gives you the ability to quickly deploy is it possible if it is possible if you reduce the effort from your perspective significantly so i'll talk about the two approaches that we typically take to deploy one of them is less work one of them is a little bit more work and then the second piece obviously both from a monthly fees perspective there is definitely my understanding and maybe my realizatdion after the fact was that what we presented as an roi might be fantastic in all in paper in numbers but what we may be asking for in terms of fees might actually be increasing your budget.
rep, okay.
rep,and and this is all assumptions obviously so whats my suggestion was to let's just take a look at it from both perspectives both deployment and second is price so let me do this let me switch it up a little bit let me go with the implementation first and then we can very quickly talk about price because just give me a hint i mean am i correct in assuming that we are priced higher than your current implementation correct.
rep, yeah that is a true statement.
rep, got it perfect so that was a good assumption that all right so switching it up a little bit implementation for sparkfun then there are three elements that we require one is just you know garbage don't worry about that that's just i was creating an account for you that's my implementation team loves to create long documents so ignoring that.
rep, i love them all.
rep, but next step is to actually get the catalogue upload to us so there's a couple of ways to be done method one which is faster and less effort for you guys is you just have any feed any food at all that you currently have today either it's going to your current provider some other vendor whatever may have you just give us a copy of that however easy that is if you have if you put it on an ftp site we can pick it up from there i don't know what that looks like but we will take the owners of converting that into an unboxed and standard format okay the second obviously method is a little bit more work for you guys there is a rest of api that you can call and upload the feed directly into our system okay so hopefully method one will be easier step two or step one point three is the analytics integration so this is this pretty straightforward do you guys use tag managers.
rep, no.
rep, okay so im assuming that you will be used google analytics so i think you might haven't deployed a javascript snippet from google right very similar to that we have a javascript snippet and just very simple clicks that we need to track you just need to add simple tags and i'll show you what they look like okay so here's what the javascript tag looks like wherever you have your ga tag just copy this as well straightforward the next is just to able to track clicks and this is not something that we have to do right away this is something that does help us figure out user behavior so if you wanted to deploy beyond relevancy clearly relevancy step one but beyond relevancy if you want to deploy user behavior this clickstream data becomes very helpful and it's as simple as just adding the ease html tags everywhere there's a click so add to cart order and product clicks whether browse or search plate pages and that's it those are the simple three tags that you gotta add okay so that's required no matter what path we take as a foundation and step one point four is again one of my implementation loving people long documents it's we're gonna validate it for you.
rep, first we will right.
rep, okay that is not the medicine talking by the way i'm syndicated all the time okay yes so once we do the foundation there are two approaches approach a and approach b approach a is what we call you the hosted search at a very high level i can quickly show you what i mean by this okay what i mean but this is let's take rods as a customer of ours you can see the url is rods comm if i search for a sale jeans it goes to search rod dot com.
rep, we can yeah.
rep, i'm sorry say that again.
rep, now we can see.
rep, what you couldn't see before.
rep, yeah.
rep, oh shoot did you guys see this stuff.
rep, right now we see jeans western women.
rep, yeah we could see your page it just hung when ever.
rep, it is loading wrong.
rep, you're trying to transfer between applications it seems to be going there.
rep, okay got it hold on let me there we go you were able to see this though right through the implementation document.
rep, perfect all right so rod i'll i'll do this again so this is our homepage for rods so you can see in the url it's rods dot com then if i do jeans.
rep, yeah okay there you go.
rep, and now it goes to search dot com so this is approach one where searched our rods comm from top to bottom it's completely hosted by us and we and this is obviously a short-term solution for you if we wanted to deploy very quickly and the reason to suggest that is as approach one because most of the work is done by us so you can see here hosted page creation will do that you just have to give us your search results template so we get your stylesheet your html and your template and we'll put everything together the only thing that we expect from sparklin team is to create a subdomain called search dot sparkfun dot com and it doesn't have to be search it can be fun dot sparkfun dot com it can be any subdomain per se and to create create a sub domain which is straightforward and do a seen an entry just redirect it to host a lot cpi and enable course and this is also very very straightforward enabling course it's two lines of change and then if you are using ssl certificates then we just need a copy either a wild card or something for the subdomain.
rep, and then the form submit action which is again one line change so today it must go to sparkfun dot comm something let's try so it goes to slash search results turn equal resistors right so instead of that it will just go to search dot sparkfun dot com and we will take care of the actual rendering of the page and then include the order suggest script and the auto suggests group would be very similar to how you do ga analytic scripts you just place it everywhere because the search box is going to be visible or every single page right and that's it so those are the steps that you have to do for hosted search the rest of it is all taken care of by us we the autosuggest script again like i said will be designed by us we'll convert it into html and will basically give you a div tag such a place in your search box and that's it that is the hosted search approach very fast very quick and it's assuming tim you can see that these steps are pretty straightforward and quick.
rep, i don't assume anything.
rep,  implementation for those isn't unmanageable.
rep, got it perfect the next approach which is approach b this is where you will have to do a little bit more work but definitely puts you more in control of the search page etc for any changes that you make and this is where you know obviously all the search relevancy configurations will be done by us once we get the catalog of any kind of tuning that still is done by us regardless of which approach you take then here's the api's for different pages or different sections within the search page where you have a search api you have facets and filter api's and you have sorting and pagination api's right so again this is all restful api s and our responses are in xml or json but this second is easily see tim where your team will have to take a little bit of for heavy lifting and you know call the apis  get the results back convert them into the application understands and then render the results right again spell check etc we obviously will validate once you implement all the api functions and  auto suggest still exists as the same element that you have to in this is well give you the auto suggest will design it everything will also give you the div tag for that you can also design your own auto suggest not that we recommend that because we will work with you to figure that out anyways but you'll have a lot of control over it as well so that's the two approaches at a very high level and as you can see the hosted approach is what i was suggesting that could really cut down on the effort and puts more and it's not that the effort is gone it's just that it puts more effort on unboxes team rather than sparkfun.
rep, hmm.
rep, you do not lose any functionality either approach you still get everything that you were supposed to get it's just that with the hosted approach because we're hosting everything if you make a change to the taxonomy and i'm assuming you don't make changes that often.
rep, no we dont make.
rep, yeah sixonmy correct and so or the footers for that matter you know if you don't make changes that often then obviously there's nothing really that needs to be changed that frequently and eventually you can see and you can do a very quick test using it using it this way right you do the hosted search you can quickly test are we producing better results than your current provider and that is where our 90-day roi sort of guarantee comes in you don't pay us anything for the first 90 days you compare us to your current provider and only if you're happy that you may want to then say okay this is making us more money to justify to assign resources to actually do it from the backend so we have so you guys have full control but a lot of customers continue using the hosted search approach also for for a long time like you saw in rob's example they've been using this for over a year now and with no complaints at all so either way it's fine even for the long term or the short term but hosted approach takes away a lot of the effort from your team puts you in our lab so that's the implementation  .
rep,any questions i know i very quickly went through that i can certainly send you this document also after our call you guys have it.
rep, yes i would actually be very helpful know i can talk to an engineer try to understand.
rep, absolutely yeah absolutely no problem any questions or confusion.
rep, no i think that really for us it would end up being a temporary approach i don't know for how long it would be but we're going to want to end up you know with facets and filters and changing the display between two or three different databases and so for us the long term is going to have to be the api approach but it's nice to know that that middle step is there.
rep, correct and again also the reason to do the middle step is to test us right i mean we have always said so far is everything on paper we haven't really proves anything out to you guys so to prove it out without having to spend a lot of it resources this is the best approach and it's very peripheral right you've not made any code changes significant code changes everything is peripheral and you can very easily back out because it's one line change to back out your form search form action field you change that ad and suddenly unbox stops working all right you go back to your old provider so so one line change to back out of this and that's why we wanted to suggest that very quickly okay now coming to the test part so from the roi perspective i know we were going down the path of saying you know this is what the numbers could look like based on what we saw as far as the performance today the assumption was again that our 5500 cost is definitely higher i don't know how much high am i or how close am i but what i wanted to get your input was to give me some guidance some advice to say look ma no we like unbox this product is definitely better than what we have today solves a lot more problems obviously but it is twice as high ten times high one and a half times i some guidance so i can come in and say how low do i need to go and then i can internally get it approved to say look if you want this business we have to match this price point or we come close to it which is reasonably close to it and only then we'll get the business if they don't approve it obviously it's a moot point but i will try to do my best to get it approved inter alia and so you get a better product at the same price we are not increasing your cost and the only effort to try this would be this few steps and tim you you can talk to an engineer and i can guarantee you there's a very simple steps and you'll be able to test this out so any guidance on what my price point how far i am.
rep, you're very very far away mmm.
rep, twice as far wa can i can i give you some guidance twice as far three times as far i mean.
rep,  zero .
rep,oh really.
rep, yeah yeah you we could argue you have two extra zeros that would be an aggressive statement .
rep, we know we're really low no but but it is working for the cost that we have it's not a perfect solution and certainly we agree with your sentiment that unboxed would solve more problems but that's the truth.
rep, but yeah that's kind of where originally why we kind of walk walked away was aggressive but we were like this isn't something we're even going to like try to spend too many resources on because we knew it was going to be a big resource allocation we knew you know trying to implement this in terms of what we were able of doing for fourth quarter was going to be very hard for us and then the costs associated with it were so far beyond what we were currently paying that it it's hard to justify and even they don't not to get you inside baseball but even the cost associated with increased sales sounds really great but you know our profit margin margin could support it in theory you know the great thing about sales is in theory you think it makes you richer but it doesn't always the cost associated for sale that's the margin increase unit is what we're going to need in terms of infrastructure to support additional process being put out you know we make boards for a living so if we're selling board that's great if we're selling lower margin items it's not so you know there was a lot of things that would have had to get put into that calculation that as a company we just haven't been here so we're we were very focused on going okay fourth quarter is going to be here but the idea of saying oh we're going to have a cost model associated services not fixed prices going to be based on you know an annual increase in sales differential was definitely something that wasn't received well because of the idea of oh we're going to pile up this in fourth quarter which is our busiest quarter so there was just a lot of things associated with it that that caught us enough in a way that that that made us want to like kind of hit the pause button till january.
rep, gotcha so so one thing at a time that's definitely that's definitely this so this what i would i understand i hope when you say two zeros it's you're not paying fifty or hundred dollars per month.
rep, yeah basically we are it's right in there.
rep, let's say we're paying $100 a month per search right now.
rep, oh wow this is really interesting you know i thought the best-case scenario that i could be really far off would be i probably am three times more expensive because of the volume especially because of the volume so you will have 166 k search volumes per month and and this is a sas product is that correct him.
rep,  its a what.
rep, it's a sas product they're not hosting it on premise this is something of that day.
rep, right third-party company sas yeah.
rep,  okay all right this is a revolution okay so.
rep, you know we have we know we understand the feel we're getting which is one of the reasons why like we might not be getting a lot out of our search but you know so we have to really be blown away to increase our cost tenfold and more than that.
rep, so we also know and have recognized that some of our issues with search are on our end it's not with our vendor and so it is not something that we can just you know think that a better tool will impress so and your tool.
rep, is a drastically better-------.
rep, an awful lot of our internal implementation problems with the cost associated with that you.
rep, bet let me share this number maybe maybe this might help so let's say if i was and i i cannot do a hundred dollars that is now get fired if i were to do that but let's say if i were to shoot i'm gonna get killed for just doing this too but let's see if i were to do $500 okay let me just double-check what was the catalog size that you  guys have just sort of.
rep, 2500 degrees.
rep, i'm just doing an.
rep, active yeah and that's just in the product database and then we have a content database you know we have many many pages of.
rep, how many pages just roughly would you think content.
rep, 300 thousand.
rep, and all of that is indexed by the current vendor.
rep, and all of that is exact by the current vendor with the exception of videos because we don't have a video sitemap so everything all the content all the products all the custom pages are static pages all that is indexed but our videos are not.
rep, got it okay so 500 is if they're gonna keep getting me killed so if i am suggesting 500 per month that is still five times more than what you guys are paying yeah however does that bring us to a more reasonable answer because because i'll tell you why because at $500 if you're only increasing your site search just by 3.
rep,5% you're bringing in additional 86 thousand dollars which even after you think of slim margins what i would allow here is a significant improvement.
rep, so somewhere in that range is the number we can found and i think we're changing some of the ways we're approaching the budget in my department and this is the type of thing that i can point to as a fourth quarter as a line item moving forward in 2016 and start saying hey this is what this is going to start looking like and i think there is there's an understanding that search is going to cost us more money forward so and so that that is that it definitely start doable and if there is a direct sales associated like increasing with what we can see from from search it might even be able to increase.
rep, yeah gotcha i do need to get this approved internally especially because of the content piece.
rep, oh yeah.
rep, i i'm not sure maybe maybe maybe the way we can do it is because of the associated sales aspect of it maybe we can come up with some sort of a hybrid that if we are directly relating and correlating increase in sales we can definitely i can definitely try to push hard to get the product side of things managed at this rate the content is definitely going to be something i have to really double check so let me i will take that as a next step for myself to see what we can do what content and maybe we can come up with a hybrid where you still use your current provider and hundred dollars which is a phenomenal price by the way whoever is your negotiator i want to hire that guy then then we can come up with to say you can continue to use them for content and use us for product because ultimately selling more product is where you are going to see the roi piece i don't know if that's good is gonna be.
rep, just for you guys but let it over i.
rep, i apologize i actually have to go yes.
rep, definitely we need to talk about that.
rep, definitely work it on your end and we're going to talk about it internally and try to figure out how we could proceed event one of the option.
rep, all right thank you very much.
rep, yeah no thank you.
rep, tailing better team.
rep, thank you really appreciate it and i'll also follow up tim with that documents we need to have it.
rep, alright great thank you very much i appreciate .
rep,and so kristen and lera and lara lara oh my god i'm slurring now because i'm shocked that's okay look it is what it is and and this is the reality that you have to work with so that's totally fair what i will do from my perspective is to try to figure out that this pricing is palatable what are the alternatives that we can work with and if we can do everything obviously we will try to do everything and if just to get me a little bit of room to play with if i am between 500 and 1000 are we am i going beyond the range or am i still within acceptable range if i were to be able to produce this kind of sales numbers if i if you are now looking at the reverse side of things it's not totally cost.
rep, yeah i would say in the short term it be nice to lowball in the long term when we can show that the tool gives us things like a faceted structure in our data no bet we'll be able to push through a higher rate if it's just replacing our search you know it's just going to be tougher.
rep, so no that's great feedback so that that makes it very clear for me so let me do that let me hold in the back pain i'll tell you that.
rep,im fine.
rep, i think you guys got a great deal so i think you just need to work with that so let me do this i will follow up would it be at least the implementation documents that jim has it so you guys at least can see whether this is even remotely doable before for november if it is not can we do it during the fourth quarter so we can go live in the first.
rep, you know i'm not sure because we have a lot of other initiatives that are very meaningful for the business that are going to be happening in the fourth quarter and so tim will have to address any implementation issues both certainly it was anything that would be implemented would happen on the back end you know and not on the customer facing sight until q1 and that's just largely because we're ramping up on our information technology department.
rep, no i totally get it what i have a suspicion and i'm pretty confident on this is that this section that we talked about that sparklin has to do for a hosted approach this should take no more than a couple of days of somebody's time.
rep, okay and this may take a couple of days of somebody's time so all in all i think both together might be eight 16 hours 20 hours of somebody's time and if tim can allocate somebody like that everything else can be taken care of by us i do will say that going beyond the technology team the operations the marketing and merchandising team will have to spend a little bit of time with our implementation team so that all the experience that you guys have accumulated over time that has been poured into the current search solution can be transferred as a knowledge transfer to us so we can at least jumpstart the solution from day one regardless of when this gets deployed by the way so whenever you gets deploy it that session has to happen because we don't understand your business we understand what you do but we don't understand your business.
rep, of course----tricky.
rep, yeah exactly and knowing these product it's not like a paralytic you can say  dress his address on the top of the top resistor is not a resistor if one from the other and so understanding that will take a little bit of time so the owners is more on us with your guidance but from a technology perspective i'm pretty confident tim will come back and say this is this is pretty easy to do now even if he comes back with something that says it's gonna take longer we understand it will respect that and we'll work through whatever the timeframe is i'm assuming that as long as i can get this price point it's in this range there $500 if that's an acceptable range then i think that we should be we should be okay as far as whatever we try to deploy it i will.
rep, one quick question yes seems like when you gave us the demo before ultimately over time this tool will be better and more useful more profitable for us if it is a graphical user interface that non-technical people in catalog and mark on can sustain over time and it seems like that was the case is that correct.
rep, that is the case yes so yeah no i'll give you a quick review this is what the backpacking dashboard looks like you can configure rules for different search you can create synonyms on the back end and manage a lot of facets banners a lot of things reporting all of that is fully from here and this does not change regardless of which approach we take but they're hosted or back-end wouldn't.
rep, work with a look at dashboard so that's good to know.
rep, right none of the features get you do not you get all the features let's make it positive you get all the features regardless of any approach you take all right so let me do this thank you so much for your time kirsten thank you for setting this up i really appreciate thank you so much for attending as well and i will follow up with some stuff.
rep, yes and all three of us this document and your thoughts from this call and and then we'll do our due diligence getting together on this end in the next week or ten days so.
rep, thank you mano yeah no problem thank you so much and sorry for bothering you so much kristin i really appreciate your patience and support.
rep, yeah and we appreciate your dedication to because we want we know we're interested in working with you guys is what we've just got to make sure it's a write a good fit and then we appreciate you know we knew that number would would blow your mind we just have to use the same service from for many years i think that's part of it we're grandfather didn't if you will so anyway don't don't stress too much and let us know what the outcome is there and we'll as kristin said work on our end to make sure we've got our ducks in a row.
rep, perfect sounds awesome thank you.
rep, yeah have a good one in no matter.
rep,i know got some temporary glitch i think we'll not be able to hear each other properly you can hear us absolutely okay now
prospect,yeah i can hear you great thanks
rep,great thanks so much for taking time to talk to us we designed doesn't have to be a long call we just wanted to get your first level feedback on how you would want us to proceed we had sent you the nda as well so just want to have your thoughts and see how we can kick-start the poc
prospect,okay yeah so yes i receive the nda w excitehich is nice when it back but thanks for doing that and from there we i think from our side we are okay so i don't know it's good that you set up a call so that we understand what are the next steps what's needed and things like that
rep,okay great so here's the approach we were thinking of taking so we have proposed a 90 days evaluation period as well right so we were thinking you have two websites we will start integrating with the first website we go live with website one for about two weeks see the initial results if you're seeing the right trends then we start integration website two and then you roughly on an average our implementation cycles will be between three and four weeks once we get the first set first site live if there is not this check in site is not way too different from the first site probably the integration can be done even in two two half weeks as well so the way we were thinking is so the first four weeks we go live with site one then you test it for two weeks see the results then we start integrating site two between six to seven weeks with where both your sites are live on unbxd platform and you can start monitoring all the conversion rates and all the other business metrics that you would want to look at and finally at the end of 90 days you can essentially take a call whether from a overall business perspective is this making sense to you or it's not making sense to you
prospect,oh yeah yeah i don't know like what i was thinking more like having unbxd or to test to see how the search results come back something more simple than than doing it in any integration on our live site
rep,yeah so it'll actually comprised of both the phases david so one we once we set up everything we will put it on your qa you can test it on your qa for about a week's time run multiple test cases and once your test cases are all satisfied then it can actually take it live and see it on the live site as well so you can do both because if you have to since you're also looking at the entire business value proposition right i think having it run on the live site also and monitoring whether this is actually resulting in increasing conversion might make even more sense to you so that is why we thought of this thing
prospect,yeah yeah definitely thought that gotta make and looking at the overall conversion more
prospect,than than just the search results right but we have an issue with the qa we don't have a qa for temporary pre-launch website all we have is the live website at this point in time so there might be a i don't know that would there be an opportunity
rep,no no the website <> if you have a qa environment or something like that before you do any change in the current date even if you implement any new solution or you bring about some changes i'm sure you'll have a qa infrastructure or we can create at you a infrastructure for you where you can basically test out things on a qa infrastructure first on a test environment before you take things live so we can facilitate that shouldn't be a problem
prospect,okay that could work yes i'm wondering like to do a full test i don't know if you we could integrate it optimizely i don't know if <i'm here about extra money> we do we have that all in place so we do a/b test and then i just click in the search box with with yours in there would be something feasible but i'm i'm not sure
rep,yeah we have actually optimizes your a/b testing platform right
rep,yeah we
rep,can use that as well not a problem
prospect,ok so what would be the first step
rep,so the first step will be we agree upon a tentative price we look at overall all the terms and then most importantly we'd have to set up a integration kickoff call where probably somebody from your side you and if there's anyone from it i think the other day the other gentleman coming from it so we can do a overall requirement talk as to how the autocomplete design should look like any specific rule based sets that you want to look we have a normal checklist that we go through usually it's a 60-minute call we gather all the and information and then what we do is after the call is done we will send you a bunch of autocomplete designs you can just review them and see which one works for you after that my team basically does all the coding at the backend we should roughly put two two and a half week effort after that we put everything on a test environment then you can have your team just test it out once and then once you're fully satisfied with the test results then we can depending on a convenient date we can actually take it live and then start monitoring it on live traffic it should be a fairly straightforward call anticipate call at least the review which we have done on your site i don't see i was getting into any kind of complications
prospect,okay okay yup so i don't know to do these these tests and this part can be that price that separately or as part of your package how how would that work
rep,so we generally put everything as a package so because it's more convenient to have a contract executed overall because in case you see the right results and you want to continue you don't have to do renegotiation of the contract at the end of three months we essentially put everything into place now may be clearly call out the first 90 days as an evaluation period but basically you can exit at any time without any notice to unbxd and we will have a small fee associated for the poc phase as well which is generally fifty percent of whatever is the actual monthly fee say if your monthly fee for the site that we had discussed about was three thousand dollars you will probably only pay half of that amount once you fully go live that is after your test period and once we actually start serving live traffic on unbxd dot com and then whenever you choose to go ahead with the contract either before the end of 90s or at the 90th day is only when the actual monthly fees would be applicable
prospect,okay yeah so so yeah so you have mentioned we already have a price agreement right an affiliate total of <>
rep,yeah so we have discussed $3000 for the first site so we have a price agreement on that and this is basically a site that comes <>.
prospect,and the second site and how much will be for the second site.
rep,what.
prospect,and the second site.
rep,so i think what we are looking at is if you look at both the sites put together since you're already paying three for the first site and the second site actually has a lot lesser traffic we can actually do the second site at thousand dollars so put together site 1 plus site 2 will be $4000.
prospect,okay okay yeah no i think with regards to pricing i think we are given the fact that it's still more expensive then they they owe that company that we are looking at. we definitely wanna we want to have an option right have at least analysed to any make a decision beyond only pricing because if it was only pricing will go with with next popular but we want to see in action all the features and all the additional benefits that's why we are trying to do these this poc and what we want to do with with both right to give a fair comparison oh.
rep,yeah absolutely absolutely and that's why we are honestly telling you give us that 90 days opportunity we will run both your sites let's go at site 1 then we will closely observe site 2 and then see the entire benefits over the next 90 day period. and once you're fully convinced and then we'll come back to you we will also be monitoring your analytics right where after 90 days if we believe that okay my solution is not worth $4000 it's probably worth only $2000. we will come back and tell you that okay you can only pay us $2000 from and the 91st day we have fairly flexible of that front because we want to make sure that you see the value with the products than anything else.
prospect,yeah yeah definitely okay let me get back to you on the next step <with> alex he's out of the office on vacation this week.
prospect,and i will be next week out so so i'm gonna send him an email and communicate via him and to see what his point of view it but um beyond what we talked today.
prospect,what do you need in terms of you you said you wanted to do or ask me what would be the like in general template information that you need from our side the access it and stuff like that so i can start preparing that with alex so that we can we can look for that integration later on not passed away.
prospect,yeah yeah that may work.
rep,that may work right.
prospect,okay yeah we can we can we can do that.
prospect,okay so let's do that <okay guys i went for information> yeah go ahead.
prospect,it would work better if we can do tuesday would be better as i said it would be his kids birthday in the office tuesday would work better.
rep,i know i know i understand so around the same time tuesday might work for you for half an hour.
prospect,yeah i'll tell you the contract i cannot sign the contract the contract only to be signed by the president so i'll brief the president on on what it is and and the contract has to make sure that it's we can cancel the contract after the trial period right.
rep,yeah anytime within the 90 days period yeah you don't have to use any notice.
prospect,okay and then after you wanna cancel after six months how does it work.
rep,so usually since we give such a long evaluation period we give you a three-month evaluation period after three months we expect you to continue for the remaining nine months of the one-year contract after the first year you can say cancel anytime with a 30 day notice.
prospect,oh ohh okay.
rep,if we would have had such a long poc and there will be a lot of effort from both sides involve we will assume that you won't cancel in the remaining part of the first year but from second year you can cancel anytime with a 30-day notice.
rep,does that sound okay.
prospect,okay we'll do that.
rep,okay thanks so much for the opportunity david we are very confident we'll show you the right value and we will make sure you look good in front of your president you have chosen us and we will not let you down.
prospect,great okay great.
rep,thank you so much david it was great talking to and talk to you again.
prospect,thanks to you.
rep,thank you david thank you for giving us this opportunity i'll send you the details thank you have a good day.
prospect,thanks bye.
rep,how are you.
prospect,good how are you.
rep,i'm good thank you for asking and thank you for giving us the time to show you our solution today.
prospect,absolutely i'm trying to figure out how to turn off my voice because i think i'm on the computer and on the phone so give me one second i guess i <can turn my phone off>.
rep,yeah alisin.
rep,sounds good so before we get started you know i know you had a <heart stop> for 30 minutes but i wanted to make sure i ask you this right what caught your interest in unbxd if you can give me a little more understanding about it then maybe i can walk you through the right elements and then and probably make the best utilization of this time.
prospect,yes we <are a small agency> we work with a bunch of this small to medium sized brands we have a client and they are a like a nutrition and supplements company for like bodybuilders and people who work out and so they have a lot of different products mostly for like either to they have like kind of three different segments one is like to lose weight one is for strength and then the other is health.
prospect,and so they they want to kind of implement a personalization software onto their website and possibly emails also when someone comes to the website they're gonna have some you know some products on the homepage they're also going to have some articles and some videos.
prospect,and they're also gonna have a quiz that the the customer can take to kind of like enter in what their fitness goals are.
prospect,and so you know they just want the experience to be customized right now they are on wordpress and bigcommerce so i sent you an email a few minutes before asking you that was it was possible to integrate with that so that's you know one of my big questions.
rep,sure we can we can surely integrate on bigcommerce that's surely not at all a problem we have quite a few customers on bigcommerce.
rep,so also i wanted to understand like how big is this customer with regards to say their online revenue how many how many products they would have in the catalog or maybe say how many site visits or sessions are they getting.
prospect,i believe you know i don't have access to their data yet i believe that their i mean their revenue is pretty big i'm gonna say close to fifty million.
prospect,would that be online or what.
rep,would that be online revenue or the offline revenue.
prospect,i'm not you know i'm not sure actually that might be retail too so i'd have to get back to you on that one but i do think they have pretty significant traffic i'm just that i don't have that information in front of me.
rep,the only reason i asked you that is because the way the solution has been has been priced we typically see ourselves a fit for companies which are at least at least will say i would say eight to ten million in revenue online right otherwise they find the solution to be a little more on the expensive side because they will not be able to justify the right roi to it right.
rep,unless there is there is enough traffic on the site they don't see enough conversions and then hence the the roi on the on the price that kind of becomes challenging but as far as the customers are above that range about eight to ten million in revenue then we can surely show them a 10x roi with whatever investment they make with unbxd.
prospect,well what would be the price if they were about eight to ten million.
rep,the price depends on various different factors these are the elements right basically in terms of how many products they have what's their site visits or page views especially with recommendations and based on that i can i can give you a pricing. so say typically if someone was at 5000 products 100000 sessions a month that that would cost like $1000 a month right that's a very high level understanding of the price but as it grows the price doesn't double but yeah the price still goes a little higher.
prospect,i mean i believe they probably have like mmm i want to say like 150 skus mm-hmm and yeah i'm not really sure about the visitors that i have to learn more about that but you said a hundred thousand views and that's at the 10 million mark.
rep,no the hundred thousand the 100 thousand visits site visits on the site and that that would be thousand dollars a month.
prospect,okay and does it matter is it more on my company visitors take it or is it more about like how many products they have.
rep,typically so for that range of products right anything less than thousand thousand products really doesn't make much of a difference be it 200 products or five hundred or thousand products our infrastructure cost towards it it's still the same.
rep,from from a page views perspective it does change the metrics right how many page views people are having because we have two level of analytics that goes into picture and and we store that in our infrastructure right.
rep,on the site per product analytics so how often this product is being clicked how and then viewed and then added to cart right that's one the second thing is per user every user coming onto the site what are their activities per product right how what what are the kind of products they're they're viewing they're clicking they're adding to cart and then checking out right.
rep,so those are the two levels of analytics that that we have to store that's our infrastructure cost primarily and then hence when the visits increase that analytics data also increases and then rendering that data right so there is a cost involved in that as well and that's where the cost goes up.
rep,but say for 500 products or thousand products really doesn't make much of a difference but yes 100000 visits to 200000 visits the price would change.
prospect,got it okay.
rep,does it answer your question.
rep,okay great sounds good let me just quickly open up a deck so we also have a site search solution i know you have you don't have much time today so maybe i can i can show you that later if you have a lot of customers looking for site search and recommendations but yeah another product suit is site search.
prospect,yeah maybe any other time i think right now we're just looking at the product recommendation.
rep,i get that i get that just trying to share my screen here just give me a moment till i do that do you see my screen.
rep,okay great so to give you a high level understanding about us we are a five and a half year old company headquartered in sunnyvale with offices in chicago and india our core engineering team works out of the sunnyvale office customer success sales team working out of chicago we are actually three hundred and fifty plus customers in the us 1200 plus globally.
rep,some of our customers from an enterprise space newegg ashley home store express bells i'm sure you must have heard of most of these. brands very specialty sites deborah lippmann vac parts puravida bracelets sylvane very specialized in these sites in with regards to what they do.
rep,platforms we can integrate or implement into any e-commerce platform be it bigcommerce magento prestashop ibm or even a homegrown e-commerce platform right.
rep,now the unbxd recommendation right the technology is built on primarily four principles popularity  wisdom of crowd content and personalization.
rep,popularity right so popularity for a particular period of time popularity of a product on the site how popular it is right in terms of the views the clicks added to cars right the sales so we gather a lot of data around that wisdom of crowd right.
prospect,and is that would show sorry a question is that what you would show to someone if you don't have any information on them yet.
rep,exactly yes so not not just that but all of these four would imply would apply a new customer versus a repeat customer and i will show you how right.
rep,so say wisdom of crowd now someone coming from someone looking for a jacket on the site right one customer coming from new york versus another coming from san francisco.
rep,now someone looking for the jacket coming from new york you know they're coming from a colder region and there is there is you you would want to show them or warmer jacket someone coming from california maybe la sfo you know they are coming from a warmer region you might want to show them a lighter jacket right.
rep,so the geo-location that is another thing that kind of comes into picture or this is also the wisdom of crowd what is it that people are looking at from east coast versus say west coast from a particular state right or a city.
rep,what are the kind of products which are more popular and it could be because of various reasons right it could be the festivity it could be the trend it could be some sporting season that that red color is very popular in new york for right now say correct or say christmas the red red color is in in for christmas everyone is looking for red color now you know when someone is looking for a jacket you also need to start showing them red jackets because that is what is popular right.
rep,then content in terms of what they are clicking or what they are viewing the content of that particular product right so if you are looking for a 50 50 dollar product by a brand abc now we know that abc or say from nike you are looking for a nike shoe now we know reebok and adidas are also similar kind of catalogs.
rep,now you would want to start showing them either other nike products or you might want to show similar brands you might want to start showing them other adidas or reebok product so we also tune the system based on your catalog and your business priorities then price rate say $100 someone is looking for a $100 shoe.
rep,so now you know that you might want to show them product plus and minus of say 10% or 20% something that you can define and then start showing them products between eighty to hundred and twenty dollars someone looking for a 150 dollar product you don't want to show them a fifty dollar shoes right you want to try and show them something which is in their price range which is in their price affinity basically so we also do that.
rep,personalization right real time for every action that the customer makes right we start gathering a lot of data and and and start using it for real-time personalization we don't want to wait for them to come back right.
rep,a lot of personalization companies what they do is the first visit they gather a lot of data they kind of process it take 24 hours to process it and post 24 hours whenever the customer comes back to the site they start using that data whereas with us it's all in real time from the very first click that the customer is making the personalization just kicks in.
rep,new customer versus repeat customer what's the difference right so a new customer what is the location they're coming from what is the festivity there what is the trend right and what is their current action on the site and those are the things that come into picture to start recommending products versus for repeat customers.
rep,we would have save an implicit profile of each customer that that comes onto your site and start collecting a lot of data around their affinities towards price towards brand towards style and then start recommending products based on all of those right if you like a rolex watch on on a site right and that's what you usually come and see i would want to start showing you rolex watch and not the tissot or say a fossil because now we know what your what your affinity is towards in terms of the price and the brand correct.
rep,so i would want to show rolex and some of the other more expensive swiss watches to you rather than showing some of the cheaper designer watches.
prospect,yes but i think you're gonna get into it when you go into the algorithms.
rep,sure so on on high on high level what what we're giving you are ten different features right recommend for you more like these meaning similar products recommended for you is completely personalized for you based on whether you are a new customer or a repeat customers highly customized product for you.
rep,brand top sellers when you are looking at a particular brand products you can even place a widget it shows that particular brands top sellers complementary products right which could be say a like any similar products basically category top sellers when you're within a particular category we start recommending products within that particular category.
rep,recently viewed someone comes onto your site is on the site now say got called into something else got called into a meeting could not look at your website for next 24 hours comes back to your site after 24 hours it's important to start showing them some of the products that they were looking at on your site right when they were last on the site and and help them continue their product discovery journey from there rather than them coming again and start searching for the products that they would have looked at in the past.
rep,viewed also viewed that's also the wisdom of the crowd right so say people coming from new york of that particular during that particular period of time last one week have been viewing particular products right so you start we start showing the same similar products to other people so person a looking for a nike shoe right.
rep,a typical kind of a nike shoe it got viral because of say some footballer or a soccer player played it used it in the game it became popular right so everyone coming from new york is now looking at that shoe so the moment someone else comes comes in and looks for a nike shoes we know that this is the most popular shoe and we need to start showing that right.
rep,bought also bought on same pretty much on the similar logic some something that's been bought the customer with the same affinities towards brand price category if they're bought a product we start recommending other similar products.
rep,homepage top sellers typically what's more popular on your website right those could be your homepage top sellers which could be for a period of time you could you could come in and say define show the top sellers for last one week or one day or one month right and we start showing those.
rep,and similarly pdp top sellers again within the pdp page similar products which are which are top sellers we start recommending those here are some examples real-time personalization hand picked just for you on the home page right more for a repeat customer or even for a new customer and you start recommending some of some of the products right on the home page.
rep,another example for popular items items which are popular over last one week 10-days 7-days you start showing those popular products or top sellers on the home page.
rep,alternative products someone looking for this particular bracelet right now we know they are looking for a particular bracelet which has a has which is pink in color $65 in price range called as yoga girl pack right something on the same lines you start recommending products again and you will notice that the price ranges are pretty much plus or minus of 20%.
rep,the moment say someone clicks on a $72 bracelet now we know that they are okay with a little higher pricing so then the next set of recommendations would be a bit more higher in the pricing.
prospect,i have a question with the algorithm is it going off of what you last clicked on or is it kind of building learnings about everything you viewed and clicked and kind of weighting each thing that you've every action you made.
rep,every action that you have made on the site we start reading bid on based on that.
prospect,so its not just last click.
rep,not just the last click no if you have made n clicks so every click adds to the weightage right so it's not the most recent one but if you have made 10 clicks those 10 clicks are analyzed the 11th click the moment you make all 11 clicks are are being analyzed not just the last one.
rep,cross sell products say we would have we would have we would have seen that 5 out of 10 people buying a humidifier also end up buying cartridges so we start cross selling you can have a cross selling widget we start showing those cartridges with the humidifiers right.
rep,another example could be nail colors again say 5 out of 10 people who are buying lip color with the nail color so now we know that we need to start recommending the lip colors as well.
prospect,and can you make rules so like if you go back to the humidifier like if i want those those to be like complimentary products can you add that one as well.
rep,yes we can also do that.
prospect,okay right.
rep,yeah up-sell and cross sell cart recommendation there is a long debate about this these are like complimentary products whether you should show it in the cart or not but we give you the widget to use if you want to put it you can surely put it in the cart recommendations right.
rep,again the customer is yet not sure whether he wants to buy this or not one step ahead of to to checkout but you still want to show them more complimentary products you can start showing them here.
prospect,are you saying that a lot of people don't want that because it ruins the <>.
rep,so the debate is some people some retailers say that the customer has already made up his mind he wants to buy this bag right so let him just go and check out i don't want to divert his attention whereas some of the others come in and say that he's yet not checked out right so i would still not want to lose the opportunity of showing him some more bags if he's yet not sure of buying this he might want to go any <bag for> so there is we meet a lot of retailers and there is always a debate about that so we leave it up to them what you feel is right for the business you could do that.
prospect,right okay do you guys ever do post transaction up-sells.
rep,the post checkout.
rep,yeah so at checkout page right.
prospect,no like you checked out you first place my order and like the next like interstitials like hey we can give you this offer for 49 point 95 do you want it check yes or no.
rep,we could do that.
rep,zero results page so say someone someone is looking on the website trying to search something gets a zero result page right there again we can place recommendation widgets for any zero page that they see on the website.
rep,they we can have two real time and highly personalized recommendation widgets recently viewed some of the products that they were already looking at and then recommendations based on their affinity towards a brand category color price point we start recommending products in real time highly personalized for that user.
rep,another example to show similar products right there could be hundreds reasons why i like this shoes could be again the brand color size designer customer can click on see similar products opened the modal window shows more similar products they like it they click on it they don't they close the window and go back to the normal category page or the search page.
prospect,and you were saying real time so as i shop around the sites around the site my widget recommendations could change.
rep,okay and then on mobile same thing on mobile being a smaller screen you might want to give them an option to evaluate similar products quickly so click on the more like this button you get three or four based on how many you want to show similar products for the customer to choose from mobile pdp page recommendations on the pdp page you can again start recommending products right.
rep,just of just more of a ui than the algorithm in terms of how it can look on mobile and we make sure that the ui goes well with the site's ui and we take care of that complete ui aspect as well.
rep,another very good feature which is which is called as buy the look very popular in the apparel so say you like the shorts right and then you can place a button buy the look now it'll start showing shirt shoes tees that go well with this short for the customer to quickly evaluate and add to cart right.
rep,so that's the buy the look this is something that is currently done by the by the merchants on a manual level basis right so you select a product and then you complete the look so every time the customer is looking at these these products they can they can complete the look by evaluating a few more products out there.
prospect,got it i had a question i forgot it oh do you have you done this with any content so like when like i was saying before our client the products but they also have a lot of like related articles and videos on their site is that something you've done.
rep,we have not done recommendations for that but yes we can look into the possibility because i would say anything doing anything for content is much more easier than doing it for product the the whole.
prospect,it's much easier.
rep,yeah it's much more easier the whole algorithm for these products is actually made out of or they built out of the content algorithm right and in something sometime in 1970s these search and recommendation all these algorithms were primarily made for documents or content and post which technology developed right.
rep,and then we actually so our algorithms are based based on lucy right lucy was built a for document search so we hacked lucy and then built our technology which is much more now appropriate to look for to do product search or product recommendations basically so obviously technology would work would work much better we can surely look into their content how what kind of content they have how much is it and we can work out that's not a problem.
prospect,okay so we only have one minute left unfortunately i'm sorry that it was late for our last call <and not> jumping meetings today but i just wanted to see so how like long would it take to implement something like this like what's the like the timeline.
rep,typical timeline is four weeks given if we get complete support from customer and when we say complete support all we need is the access from them so we will come and ask for e-commerce access and some of the ui suggestions right.
rep,so we would design all of the ui send it to them for their feedback and recommendations and then once once they give us a go-ahead we do the implementation right so sometimes that back and forth right from customers and can take much longer and then that's where the delay otherwise our eta is is i would say four weeks to implement a solution like this.
rep,sure i think one of the key question that you might want to ask them is thousand dollars a month right is that something minimum right and then based on the size the price could be a little higher also if they're smaller then the minimum that we do is a thousand dollars.
prospect,okay sounds great so i'll get back to you and let you know if they are they're valid or not.
rep,sure not a problem at all.
prospect,okay thank you so much.
rep,great thank you alisin thanks for your time have a good day.
rep,got it so alan and deborah first of all thank you for giving us the time and remembering us obviously it has been some time since we guys we talked back in february.  so i wanted we wanted to check in with you we reserved this time to check in with you guys to see what you guys were doing how you guys were evaluating and was there any concerns based on the proposal we had sent and i know you guys wanted to go through the mother's day event and sort of look at this after that.
rep, so help us understand where you guys are how can we help you and start working for you.
prospect, yeah urghhh so i was just doing digging into our search a little bit more again and i like the way you guys are you know oddly specifying the minimum guarantee increasing conversions and all that i think there when i pitched this there was a little bit of sticker shock at overall monthly costs.
prospect, so i certainly understand that it isn't a dream to work with 2000 websites.
rep, that is the complexity unfortunately that you have to deal with hence the little bit of the cost on our end because of that complexity.
prospect, yeah no i totally get that so price is obviously one concern and then the second one is just the amount of integration we're gonna have to do is going to be tough for us but obviously i mean we're gonna have to do it so.
rep, so let's start with the second question then were those the only two concerns i just wanna make sure.
prospect, yeah that's it and then i just ran kind of some of our numbers again and wanted to talk to you know how we look at the increase the minimum guarantee increase.
rep, got it so let me answer the second question first from a integration perspective so if we were to go down the front end approach which was the ajax approach that we have proposed we could create a very standardized that every sub-site could use.  and if that's okay with you guys there might be a limitation in terms of the colour and stuff it might look a little bit more for standard so it might not have some specific colours if each of the sub sites might have we can do it ajax approached from that standpoint.
prospect, yeah that's definitely ideal so just so you know all of our behind our home pages all of our sites are identical so there is no optimization with respect to colour or anything else.
rep, got it so that instance if that's the path you take then your team doesn't have to spend enough time the only thing you guys have to do is give us a page on the back end where you put the header you put the footer and the middle portion of the search results will render those results.  and so that means the owners will be more on the unbxd side to actually come up with the design come up with the results and try to figure out everything that needs to be figured out in order to make that page work.  and all your team has to do is say here's a page will render the header footer and gives you guys an empty div tag deploy our javascript and that's it everything else will be taken care of by us so which is better than the restful api approach where your team has to call the api consume the response and sort of connect that with the application to actually render the results.
prospect, yeah i think that probably will be good.
rep, let me show you a quick example if you guys don't mind.
prospect, hi if there's any way that we could get ideally this week <> in the document you sent right.
rep, correct there's three approaches that we sent in that document so we could do a hosted or ajax approach which is more onus on us can you guys see my screen.
prospect, yeah.
rep, so i can show you exactly how it would look like so a hosted page would be something like this so you go to rods dot comm and if i search for say jeans then you can see in the domain it goes to search dot rods dot com right.  now if all the pages look exactly the same then we can pretty much have this one page that's hosted which would be search dot petals dot com or something like that unless you wanna maintain that name domain so that's one.  the second option where you maintain the domain so let's see if i search for a nike here it goes through this page and you can see how it renders the header first and then a fraction of a second and then it renders the rest of the page so this is where your team can give us this one page call it search results.  you do the header and then you do an empty div tag and i'll show you what that looks like it's a very simple piece that they add there is the one so you can see a div id wrapper.  and that's you give us an empty div tag and starting with that h1 and all the way to the bottom this whole thing may render that we populated with the html that would look and feel exactly how you want to look and feel and which will obviously be the same for all 2000 sites.
rep, but it means it will look and feel exactly like you want to look and feel so you can then define and say well we want to show sorting options you want to show pagination options you wanna show facets and filters this is how we want to show the product block total control you have as to how it looks.  and and that's it that's the ajax option and then the third option was that api options where you consume the actual api in the response.
prospect, question so let's say that we already kind of have a custom html capability natively within our current custom cms platform we are able to create something where there is an empty placeholder but it already has header footer and then a left nav category section so similar to what us patriot that were doing i'm not sure if i clicked screen that section there for sort by risk of category section is that powered by unbxd.
rep, correct so everything starting from search to down below to all the way to the beginning of the footer right here is powered by unbxd so what us patriot does is the header and the footer and they give us that empty div in the middle.  now i understand deborah you coming and saying let's say if you were to do header the left-hand banner and then the footer or all you want us you to show is the search results we could do that but then what the the look and feel for the facets we may have to cover with how we do that do we do them at the top across.  if there's not many that you want to show we can do it that way or we could do it where the category is sort of shrunk a little bit and maybe the other facets show up.  so as we can come up with a couple of designs depending on how you want it.  we just as a best practice we just want to make sure that that's some of the facets like pricing and especially and maybe some of the elements that customers might be interested in is say based on typical flower or or the colour or some kind of theme that they're really going for that they're able to do that so.
prospect, i personally the check box last nav model is pretty much standard practice and the one that we're doing is kind of similar but it really is not perfect so i would actually prefer to replace our current thing with yours of course.
rep, got it okay one more yeah go ahead go ahead sorry.
prospect, my concern in terms of standpoint we currently have a lot of we currently have a lot of search result landing pages where we probably produce duplicate content for some of the stuff that we're doing so if there is some way that unbxd would be able to kind of be the new default category left nav that we could use or or be just like a something we can have across all pages not just search result pages.
rep, say that last piece again you want something that is <>.
prospect, if you go back to the screen you're on where it showed the the unbxd powered filter systems right there under category type etc.  so what's now.
prospect, so is that something where it's only possible to populate that menu on your search results pages or we able to just have that across our pre-existing category pages because my my only concern is that we currently use search results to power some of our other by price searches by colour and a few others.  and i sort of a workaround and i don't know if we're gonna be fixing anytime soon but it's it's something where i would like to know if we could have this on top of our existing category pages so not just for a search result page but.  she's just saying can we use your left nav and apply it to all of our pages.
rep, got it so let me show you something and tell me if i understood it correctly so if i go to us patriot again if i click hover on footwear and let's see if i go to boots so i'm not searching but i'm going to a category page and you want this type of left nav for that boot page.
prospect, that powered by you right there because it looks like <>.
rep, it is exactly powered by us everything starting from sort by down is powered by us here.  okay cool that sounds perfect to me.  yep i understand what you talked about that so yes so that is absolutely doable now i'm assuming the only question that i have is what would we do so the one one trick we could use is let's say sort of the structural stuff stays the same but the colors and stuff can slightly be manipulated depending on the style sheet of each of the domain that is using here.  for example let's say structurally the block looks like this and you have choose options with a it's a green background or the price with the red color but let's say one of the site uses this pink predominantly then they could create a style sheet where that class can be with a colour pink and this will automatically show up as pink.  so we can rely on that customers class but that means that that customer needs to have that class in their stylesheet.
prospect, that's correct so there are 15 css but because of the current ajax implementation that you're proposing we would have to rely on our own css and make sure we have that id in there for you to reference.
rep, correct so we can we can give you our own css also that sort of defaults it but in case so there is some work we can work around we can do there.  but structurally it all looks the same but color and some of the style the css aspect of it can be overwritten if each domain has their own css so then it still may have that certain look and feel of it being native to that particular domain and not completely outside of it.
prospect, right we have a hundred percent control over all aspects of the website so what i mean it's cultural in terms of like css stuff like that we can necessarily easily change it.
rep, got it yeah we can start with the standard and then we can figure out once we get because also looking up from the outside and i don't know how much how much of that is possible so i just wanted to throw that out there.  that as a phase two maybe we can look at that and say okay can we what now that we understand what it is what can we do and what's possible or not possible and it may not be possible but it may be possible i just wanted to throw that out there.  so the hopefully that answers the second question from an integration perspective.
prospect, okay.  yeah okay that is perfect.
rep, perfect now the first question on the price piece so this is the the magic table what i was telling.
prospect, yeah i was looking at it.
rep, okay so this is the the setup fee this is the monthly before the performance this is if we reach the performance now the only and you can see here if we divide this by two thousand this is merely if you if you were to incrementally sell one extra arrangement it will pay for itself per site right for the whole year.  i'm assuming that that's you typically the price point but now i understand that from a margins perspective it may require a couple of more arrangements to be sold but i wanted to put that in the context primarily because the effort that will that it will take for us on the back end.  because it's not this one if you remember alan the big conversation we had the big trouble for us is this maintenance of this 2000 sites we've simplified it significantly and brought the price down because we're standardizing the front end and we're standardizing the back end where the catalogue is exactly the same right.  so we have this one monolithic catalogue that allows you to be able to come to this the the old so this price point is very hard for me to reduce down to just because of that the volume and the usage aspect of it the integration we can be flexible in it.  in the sense that if that is a big number to begin with we can take some of that and put it in here and spread it for the first year if you wanted to.
rep, so i'm not sure which number is the is a bigger question i'm assuming the set up is but i mean i may be wrong.
prospect, yeah i mean the set up would be for sure i mean i so the prom i mean there's gonna be the real problem is going to be justifying that set up the full or somehow validating that we're gonna get the results.
rep, got it so by the way i don't know if you saw this you don't pay the entire setup upfront you only pay 50% of it.
prospect, cost isn't our problem we don't we don't have cost issues we have justifying cost issues i'm basically not want to do anything without making very strong provable roi case and so anything with a big upfront payment just because you know it's an unknown quantity until we see it out in the while is the <big upfront>.
rep, that's what i was saying it's not a big upfront payment.
prospect, well if we have like if we can pay that you know one month of that and then cancel after one month then i can get that passed probably.
rep, you do have 90 days so if you look at this paragraph it explains it exactly how you're expecting it so what we're saying is you pay 50% let's say it is the higher end of this it's 25000 you only pay 12500 and then you don't pay the remaining half.
prospect, yeah the 12000 is a real big number.
rep, okay what would be a justifiable number just so that i understand where.
prospect, for proof of concepts i mean like you know we generally don't pay for proof of concepts until.
rep, i'll tell you and we used to not charge for proof of concepts but i'll tell you what will happen another project will come on your desk where you will pay something and we will become a second priority and i know it sounds counterintuitive.  but the problem we've gone into is if you don't charge if you don't get access to the executives and the folks because nobody's paying for it so it's not a
rep,priority.
prospect, yeah i understand the psychology behind that that's not the case here but i i see where you guys are coming from just kind of letting you know the internal buyers here.
rep, so i understand so if it's not 12500 what would be the number in your opinion that you feel has passed muster in the past and then i can take that number back and try to run it up the flagpole see what other pieces that i have as a lever that i can use to bring that number down.
prospect, let me let me ask you this question would it be easier if we just do this on one site and do proof of concept that way i mean does that significantly reduce your guys up front kind of investment and then let's see what happens there and then 6/10 we roll it out system-wide then we obviously be much more amenable to paying you know anywhere near that neighborhood.
rep, sure so so rather than doing a bad wait may not necessarily give you the true proof of concept i'm let's you want it let's talk about the reverse of that what would be the amiable number just so that i get an idea of the.
prospect, i mean literally i don't think we've ever paid i mean i think we've site and we've already pretty much after a month to determine that yes we're going to keep them so we've already paid them.  so it's and they didn't charge us anything for the setup they didn't charge anything initially because we again have to be able to prove that this is something that's going to provide values for our sites because we actually work with a very specific revenue return on investment model that we have to stick with.  and we our budget is essentially unlimited as long as the roi is there we if we do not have any spend constraints for new vendor opportunities the only constraint we have is one proving the case up front.  or two having a smaller proof of concept that we can show our executives and say they won't charge the million bucks for this but hey we got two million bucks back as a result okay sure no problem we have the cash flow but that's not the issue the issue is that they are very strict on our roi goals because again we report monthly on our roi goals and this would be rolled into that overall cost so we have to look at that.
rep, okay so so what can we do so i understand what you guys are saying if it proves out you're okay paying these numbers it's just that upfront.
prospect, absolutely we okay with paying i mean if there are alive they're there i mean the sky's the limit as far as we're concerned we just want to be able to prove the value we don't want we don't do just brand awareness as far as working for.
prospect, i'm sure what alan was saying i think actually is a good idea if the current constraint is death time on your side to create a customized experience and one caveat to that is keep in mind our templates are pretty much identical so whatever you implement on the one test site will be reproducible across 100% of our portfolio.
rep, oh got it okay.
prospect, our site infrastructure and platform is a nightmare.  so it's not as though you will have to do it all over again for the 2000 sites or whatever number we put with you guys.
rep, correct i think the cost piece from our perspective i was pretty clear on that expectation and the setup came up in two parts one part was the front-end work that we might have to do to to create that solution that you could scale and the second part is the back end work we need to do to accommodate that 2000 variety and to be able to scale that.
rep, so based on the cycles this is what i understand it so let's say the cycle ends in the may possibly or a middle of june.
rep, so what we can do is we can we can go with one site we can go with one catalogue and reduce the number but i you say at $1000 that really puts me in a bind because that's i won't be able to pass get that passed internally here can we do so let's see if we were to do that can we do somewhere in the vicinity of five by any chance.
rep, and you only pay five for up to 90 days you pay everything else after the 90 days 5k.
prospect, oh yeah when i can pitch it.
rep, okay alright so i can bring that down to 5k in the beginning and then the monthly fees again you don't need to necessarily pay unless and until it sort of proves out after the fact the only request then we have is during those 90 days we will need access to you guys.  in terms of in terms of making sure because day one we go live it's not just magically gonna work right we'll have to work with deborah and her team and anywhere to try to figure out what your needs are so we can and configure this so that we get there.
prospect, middle of june <> yeah assessing trackers to implement which we're going to probably have to send by end of next week.
rep, so how can we structure it in such a way that those 90 days if you're not getting paid even say 50% of the fee.
prospect, i can assure you we won't be the stumbling block on this i mean you'll have a number access you need we don't have like you know three weeks wait to return emails ever for anyone so that's not an issue.
rep, got it so we can then defer everything after the 90 days if five thousand in the beginning and then everything after 90 days can we reduce the 90 to 60 by chance.
prospect, you can reduce it to two weeks if you get the statistical significance in that period of time.
rep, right.
prospect, i think we have enough searches on pedals like on to do but i mean literally as soon as you get the statistical significance will revisit contract then and roll it out wide.
rep, okay so the only reason i thought 60 is because it's not just from a roi perspective but also from you guys is ability to manage search also right because you will get into it you'll be like all of these that we can do easily influences the alias because we're able to do these things.  i got it so the analytics piece all the other pieces so what you're saying is the details for the next round needs to be in their hands before june middle of june let's say and then they started implementing in middle of june and then by end of july they will have the say the catalogue and the analytics live.  and obviously the system by itself will be able to take care of a lot of these things a lot of these challenges that you guys have i have a sense that maybe 60 days will be enough obviously we will come to you and say if 60 days is not enough let's push to 90 which is what i typically ask for 90.
rep, but what i can do is we can keep it 90 and we can put a clause in it to say let's evaluated every 30 days in case the roi is reached then we don't have to wait till 90 to invoice would that be fair.
prospect, yeah sure that's fine.
rep, okay alright sorry go ahead.
prospect, in determining that roi and you know a demonstrable lift how do you typically measure that.
rep, got that so i was i'm glad you brought that because i was going to answer that question in two ways so one is we have our own analytics but you don't want to trust our analytics because you could say whatever we want to say if you were in the fairness like that.  and so we always look at your analytics now the way we look at your analytics is whatever analytics tool you guys are using today we established kp me establish kpis so you can you guys need to give us we would request in that mail we request that you give us access to your analytics we can establish a base work with you using your tool to establish that base.  tell you what kpi is you guys are looking at we all agree on that kpi you go live and we all monitor that kpi.
prospect, yeah so no you know i it seems to me like the relevant kpi is so we use omniture and so i think conversion participation on searches seems to be the right one.
rep, correct so alan there's two parts to this i want to make sure so conversion is absolutely important because that's what the dollars and cents will come down but you also want to make sure that there are other kpis.  for example if let's say the customers are clicking on a search results so they're finding what they need but they're not buying because the price point might be too high or or once they find what the product actually contains they may not be interested in.  so we also want to make sure that we don't get penalized based on a particular approach that at that time pedals might have taken where the prices are high or you know what i mean it's not seasonal.
prospect, yeah we don't we don't change our prices of the fair enough i mean we can just look at yeah i mean look at year-over-year we haven't changed our search in year and three years probably.
rep, got it so what we want to make sure is the conversion absolutely has to be the end coin but we also want to make sure that demonstratively people are able to find products the customers are able to find products they're clicking on it and going to and adding to cart.  so we can then start working in parallel the other stuff so possibly beginning of august is when we can go live.  if they actually don't convert the fact that they're adding to cart to conversion is there something else something else that's going on maybe the checkout is too long maybe you guys introduced a survey that people don't want to answer it takes turns them off i don't know what how changes happen.  but we want to make sure there's 2 or 3k kpi not just one reliance but then ultimately it's your decision even within the 90 days as you can see in the agreement we have not put any fill fine print if the sun is not shining in los angeles that day you guys can cancel it right we learned that.  the only to be fair to us we just want we request and you look at the kpi not just one kpi about a couple of them.
prospect, yeah i mean i think there's a number of different ways that we can control for that whether it's year-over-year before and after i mean i think that's easily but you know just from our perspective there's like the only thing that management cares about is the conversion.  right that sums up that.
rep, well absolutely ultimately it is the conversion but let's say you find out that oh we thought search was not converting with unbxd customers are going and adding to cart but they're not buying because something else is going on and certainly that revelation sort of unjustly puts us in a bind so you can still cancel we we don't necessarily have any legal obligation to put you in a bind.
rep, okay that makes sense okay from a agreement perspective alan i know you gotta talk about this internally any timeline on that piece so is it is this any by any chance possible based on this to get it executed before end of may.
prospect, yeah i understand that.
rep, we just want to make sure it's fair that's all that we get a chance to sort of talk about that but i understand if conversions don't come up doesn't matter if unbxd was promising the moon or the mars the money is not there to pay off that doesn't mean anything.
prospect, yeah i just want to set expectations the other nice thing about this with one side is that we'll have 1900 other sites to you just be of the a/b test.
rep, so perfect absolutely although a sort of tipton and against us but that's okay because it's maybe we do let's figure this out i'm i'm very clear on what your expectations are from a cost perspective.  maybe if to be fair to us also maybe we will do all the sites will will do the investment will put that's given in the game and take that risk so it puts more onus on us which is fine but i just want to make sure we are fair.  so if it turns out that<>.
prospect, you cut off right there hello.
rep, can you can you hear me still.
prospect, now we can.
rep, okay sorry so what i was saying is just to be fair to us if it turns out that doing more sides is more favourable in terms of a true a/b test then we probably go down that path and we'll eat that cost upfront and wait for the deferral payment to come in i just want to leave that open in case.
prospect, fine that's fine.
rep, because now i understand it's the cost upfront cost because that is the issue then we'll figure that out.
prospect, yeah we'll figure that out.  quick question on the capability of your search do you have ability to send reports on search queries or not sound search query so that we'll be able to <> search and seo and.
rep, yeah absolutely right so you deborah you will have access to if you're the one who's going to manage this through this report which shows you the tops of sorry the top zero results you can see here the number of times that particular query came up.
prospect, yeah it's possible i think it's possible.  yeah okay.
rep, okay i'm sorry say that again.
prospect, if you cooperate we can also see an aggravator team they've all transferred.
rep, yeah because this this will be one back-end it will be one dashboard for all the sites.
prospect, okay no problem.
rep, and and this is where you will see all the queries and how their performance is okay and you'll also see that by product as to which product is performing and how well or how not.
rep, okay perfect no that's that's all i wanted to do so what i can do is i can work on this get it to in your hands today what we can also do is to prepare for that june integration timeline can we schedule a call with the dev team and our dev team so we can understand the logistics and figure that piece out.
prospect, so are we going to be able to add a segment in here or by site id or domain or is it all will be aggregate.
rep, so it is all aggregate which is why we are able to reduce the cost because i think alan was about to launch a nuclear missile and i gave him the first price which was each individual site was separate so you'll have two thousand sites that you'll build manually that separately.
rep, we have made it as one monolithic feed so you have if it's like one catalogue on the back end that is being used by our two thousand front end.
prospect, got it.
rep, so for example just to be just to be clear for you deborah let's say let's say you take a query this is our front end and you create like what's an event ohh mother's day came up right so let's say mother's day special something like that let's say you create a query like that okay and then i create a rule then merchandise.  let's say convert to landing page by clicking on the white box here click ok and let's say i say i'm just trying to narrow this down to something simpler search by price okay.  so this is want to show for mother's day special you create this rule the front end shows this for that query it means that all 2000 sites will show this result set for that query.
prospect, so we would not have any exclusion capabilities will have a pose where you have to read this this is a big example at a later date simply because we have other countries where we wouldn't have mother's day special works it's not mother's day at that time.
rep, so the so petals is not limited to australia it's outside of the australia too.
prospect, correct we do have it it's the same mother's day.
rep, i'm sorry i so i misunderstood then deborah said i thought that you want so would it be you want mother's day special to only run for a specific group of out of those 2000 sites correct.
prospect, if we're mixing in the united kingdom sites or anything like that and now is money but that's we can revisit that later just that's just something to keep in the back of your mind at that.
rep, so we'll be uk site be petals dot uk or dot com dot uk.
prospect, i don't know let's take that dot uk.
rep, got it so we what we can do is for region specific if you have groups like that what we can do is we can create a group as a site so we can say this is the australia site the uk site this is the us site something like that or south america depending on how groups you have.
prospect, i think i have to come after we get internal sign-off from the executive team.
rep, so even within australia if you have multiple groups we could do that even within a particular country the only problem we run into deborah yeah is the fragmentation cannot be as large as 2000 that is that was to too big.
prospect, no no no nowhere like that there's literally like three groups i think australia need you and uk.
rep, okay got it.
prospect, may be it is two in australia for that matter.
rep, yeah even if the grouping was like three or four that's still okay what we can do is or may be five let's say what we can do is we can have five groups within australia and you can give you a different login for save the new zealand group and a different login for a uk group so we can separate them out in case you have different folks managing each country for you.   gotcha okay.
prospect, i think you already kind of sent the the integration requirement so i think that's all we need to get an estimate from our dev team of how long or if we can fit this into the next release cycle or what so which we will talk to them about next week.
rep, so then you can have different rules for different groups and different products for different groups etc.
prospect, great.  perfect that sounds good.
rep, it's just how many groups we can do is where the cost really comes in because each group comes with its own catalogue which needs to now get replicated so if you have to replicate that catalogue multiple times that's the incremental in the cost piece.
prospect, yeah i understand.
rep, okay perfect and and you can see that from the piece here so as you can see the catalogue piece number of flows so this is 800 mm look at that piece go i'm just trying to find don't mind i think i probably didn't put that in there here or i don't know lights is 800 k florists.  definitely made a mistake there so i'll correct this and resend it because if it was mm okay i don't like x number first i'm not sure the sessions we put them here at 400 k i wonder and it is this should have been actually catalogue.  so this should say catalogue oh catalogue multiplied by florists got it so that's what the problem was yeah that this should be just catalogue as in number of products.
rep, got it in case there's questions over the estimates come back as too high just let us know because we know how our it teams work and why they might come up with higher standards so we can pick and choose and pare things down to try to get the estimate down in case it comes becomes like that if it's not that's fantastic.
rep, what is the pace on the back log would this the timeline seen like are.
prospect, i mean i would really hope my end of july.
rep, until july you want to launch.
prospect, i think well under july we'd be in a position to add we need to add to our sites to get this ready for launch.  right because we have dev cycle is a month and a half and we're already in the middle of one right now so that's why i'm saying that. okay okay.
rep, because usually we have other clients who use third party consultants to do sometimes the management of the site so there's we come over 25000 you'll be surprised to do the same thing they'll come up with hundred and fifty thousand and consulting fee.
prospect, yeah i know.
rep, then we sort of look at line item by line item but it turns out that it was like five days of somebody's work from their end yeah everything's just management and project management and all that other ps as you know.  you've gone through enough of these to know a difference so that's why we wanted to say if something like that happens is let us know we'll help you through that also and and we'll hear from you.
rep, when when should we reach out alan just to sort of check in with you and in terms of the agreement internally and the signing of it.
prospect, oh late next week probably.
rep, thursday of next week would be fair.
prospect, yeah fine.
rep, alright awesome any other questions that i did not answer.
prospect, no that's it.
prospect, great thanks guys.
rep, no problem thank you bye alan bye debra.
rep,eric just a quick check did you get a chance to review the email.
prospect,yeah we're here.
rep,hey hi eric so eric just a quick check did you have a chance to review my email did the team have any questions on the poc just thought i'll get some data from you.
prospect,yes and i shared that with two of our developers.
rep,okay and would you have any metrics available in terms of your search sessions so that i can probably show you the roi on this call itself.
prospect,i can pull that up on analytics real quickly.
prospect,for what period of time.
rep,just one month any i just need the average search sessions.
prospect,okay i'll use november.
rep,yeah you can use november.
prospect,in november we had 39000 sessions with search in that there were 60000 unique searches.
rep,60000 search and would you have an approximate as to what the conversion rate were on search.
prospect,i don't know if i have that let me look no i'm not opted that in analytics.
rep,okay would you know what is your site conversion in general.
prospect,on the desktop we're <north of three>.
rep,yeah okay would you know your average conversion and the order value.
prospect,the average conversion rate for what.
rep,on your site what is the average order value or conversion rate.
prospect,yeah the desktop converts over three percent.
rep,and the order value of the cart.
prospect,right now we're trending at about one hundred and twenty four dollars.
rep,okay just let me know if you can see my screen right now.
prospect,yes we can see your screen.
rep,yeah so this is just a sample i just built out but the intent is that so at a minimum which we want to get you make sure that you get at least a 10 x roi for your investments towards unbxd.
rep,and yeah roughly between two and a half to three thousand dollars is essentially what you would spend on unbxd the month.
rep,and this is just on search right and then if i add product recommendations it will impact on the entire site so and that's what we want to prove in the first 90 days where we want to implement search we want to implement product recommendation and together we wanna make sure that we give you at least a 10 percent roi of the minimum.
rep,again and the price does not change if the roi's 70 percent or the conversion increases 20 percent and not ten percent the guarantee is this effectively what you would see does this make sense.
prospect,yes it does.
rep,so this is for site search product recommendation essentially we take into account the overall sessions in a month or impressions in a month i just looked at a similar web where you are roughly doing about 400000 overall impressions a month on the site.
rep,so if i compute for that and even you say your conversion rate was 3% roughly on the overall site right i say 400000 sessions and i say 3% and then these already got values over here so and if i say include search and directs for about 400000 impressions it'll roughly be about four and a half thousand a month.
rep,this is essentially there's a search and directs put together <in math> so effectively you see a 33 x roi so this is essentially how you could look at it even if this conversion rate was 5% and not 10% even then you will see a 17% increase 17 x increase.
rep,any questions on this eric.
rep,and this is a document on my i would have sent you and this is the approach we would ideally want to take for the poc where our team does most of the dev work what we need from your team up front is three things.
rep,one is we will send you a bunch of custom layouts for opt or suggest you could tell us what works best for you or if you have something in mind but also let us know we can design that for your team second is we need a read-only access to your ga and third is we need all your catalog view.
rep,if you have these three things we will make sure that we will start working on it <there on> and we will have weekly calls where we will share progressed we have a collaboration mail the time your team at every point in time will know what is being worked upon and the idea is within four weeks put everything to a staging environment so that your team can test it.
rep,and then effectively if we kick start the project say next week and we get all the data we need we can use the first four weeks of jan to put everything on a staging environment say by the 25th of jan so your team will have five six days to test it out and feb 1st we can go live.
rep,feb and march we can prove the value associated with the product and then you can take a call whether you see enough value to continue with unbxd or you go.
rep,does that make sense eric.
rep,okay so any any thoughts you have on when do you want to <me to> implementation call next week wednesday work for you.
prospect,what's the speed of this.
rep,speed in terms of implementation time.
prospect,in terms of whats the is there any <loaded> on the web page.
rep,not at all we guarantee a sub 300 milliseconds response time for all requests.
prospect,may be may be <that's the surety> would you go to refer the you remember the third slide where checking some of the work we did it so large be it synonyms what not but we are yet though.
rep,i can pull up that presentation yeah this is essentially starting with autosuggest i just reviewed what is your existing autosuggest looking like and these were some of the samples that we have what we've done for express the entire forwarding autosuggest and categorization and also segmentation by geo.
rep,then this is something that we've done for a grocery site where you we have added a quick quick order on the auto suggest box itself where people can add products to cart right from the search box and these were the spell check issues i noticed i misspelled a single word i misspelled two words essentially it was not showing me the right set of results.
rep,and this is something that we've done on express like the way we have built our system is it in auto correct up to six words misspelled in a single search phrase and you don't have to go and create any synonyms or any stemmed words at all like these were frame resistant coat versus coats the intent of the user does not change.
rep,one thing that you would see in unbxd is like in express you can spell t-shirt in anyway it'll still show you the same set of results because we already a have a synonym corpus of close to a million words already a part of the platform.
rep,thats why it uses machine learning to automatically start learning how people are searching for information on your site and it will automatically make sure that you don't have to create a synonym corpus for this spelling mistakes or a stemmed word it automatically builds it by itself this is essentially that we spoke about.
prospect,so we don't have to do any synonyms or misspelled at all it will happen out of the box.
rep,correct it will happen out of the box.
prospect,like <carhartt> so our brand names that we sell going to be included in that because i'm not gonna lie people spell <carhartt> and some really <bachelor> crazy ways.
rep,i understand like we have a customer called hh gregg where the word refrigerator is spelt like in so many different ways but again one of the things the way we can do this is because one of the reasons we ask you for a read-only access to your ga is for us to understand how people are searching for information on your site.
rep,and one of the things that we do is before we go live we essentially make sure that we take a three month dump of your ga and jumpstart the system.
rep,and another thing that we do is the moment we start integration we add analytics on your site it's a simple one line of javascript code that you'll have to add onto your analytics and that starts understanding and analyzing the <click stream> data so by the time we go live and you say the next 30 days the system will start learning all by itself.
rep,but yeah but at the same time if you still want to go and create a synonyms like you don't want the machine learning to pick it up but you want to just create a few ones few very very critical ones that you know like the <carhartt> spelling right then we have the option on your on our dashboard where you can actually go and create synonyms that you want to.
rep,but again 99 point 9% of the cases you don't have to go and create anything at all the system will pick it up automatically.
rep,and couple of things that we start when we start the project essentially after analyzing your catalogue and getting the first level feedback from the analyst as to how people are finding products on your site we make sure that we customize the spellcheck and a stemming algorithm very specific to workingperson's.
rep,and stage two we start working on the entire relevancy thing where if you remember we went through multiple kinds of query right thematic query or a natural language query we start fixing all those and you see that's why they <>.
prospect,yes i remember that.
rep,any other questions here.
rep,and one of the thing that we also do is when we start this project we will also dedicate a session on merchandising where your can train your merchandising and marketing team that how easy it would be <> create merchandising campaign create customer landing page create <> on the console.
prospect,and there are no implementation fees.
rep,so we have like from the month one the poc fees would be applicable that's the only fee that's applicable i think i mentioned to you the overalls for the first three months will be half your monthly fees or actually we'll be looking at a costing of about fifteen hundred dollars a month for the first three months. i can calculate that and send that to you you're looking at an overall expenses about five thousand dollars in the first three months that includes the setup includes the first two months and then by end of march you can take a call whether it's actually making sense to you.
prospect,okay i ask this our all the vendors so there is nothing personal to your product and the revenue model structure that you're suggesting how do we keep this affordable to both party's.
rep,see again one of the things that we do is before we start the project we take your baseline conversion rates what is your conversion rate today and you can track whatever has been the improvement in conversion rates after unbxd is come into the picture and you can compare it against the tool.
rep,and and it will be on your analytics your data right and if you feel at the end of 90 days that the increase in revenue is for real and it's actually making an impact on your top line or bottom line to be more precise then you continue otherwise no questions asked you can move away.
rep,and even after the 90 days at any point in time if the conversion rates dropped below 10% you can cancel the contract without any notice that's the commitment that we are putting on the contract also and i and i can share you the contract a draft contact for your review you will see that very clearly spelt out.
prospect,chris i see you on the call now did you have any questions chris did you have any questions.
prospect,just looking over the document now does it say here what your search platform is based on or is it going to be customer's.
rep,it can be customed based our solution is completely platform agnostic.
prospect,i am asking like are you using solar as the basis of your system or are you using something that you wrote your own what is it based on.
rep,sorry if it's a question for unbxd yeah we there's a <flavorforced rapport for solar to this one up on the scene> we've essentially kind of <hacked you seen> and built our own proprietary platform on top of it so that's how we saw<>.
prospect,is your platform capable of taking sales data and incorporating that into the sort order of positioning for searches.
rep,yep absolutely the only thing is during so that requires an api call to be made once we implement like after the poc period is over once we do an actual api integration for the longer term we can start consuming that data as well but for the poc there has to be a way that you send us that data so that we can start using that for our position as well because until then we'll not know what your sales data is.
prospect,okay i found an analytics better data for you visits with search for november was thirty-nine thousand four hundred and twenty six visits with search revenue four hundred and ninety two thousand three thousand seven hundred and fifteen transactions with an average order value of a hundred and thirty two dollars with a e-commerce conversion rate of nine point four two.
rep,i can structure the contract accordingly so if this is the nine point two percent even nine point two percent will be the baseline metric and we will guarantee that there'll at least be a ten percent increase within the first 90 days does that make sense eric.
rep,and just to structure my recommendation product as well would you be able to tell me what is the overall page use size for the month of november.
prospect,i'm sorry the overall number of what.
rep,page use for november.
prospect,yeah i can pull that up.
rep,because product recommendation widgets appear on every page you right we technically look at what's the overall impressions and so.
prospect,i was looking for that i have one more questions is it your search product installed on our server or as run as a service through your servers.
rep,it's run as a service through our server its a fast product our platform is amazon webservices we have six co-locations across the globe  and <users praises fast product>.
prospect,let's say that we wanted to do something like <paper> private label products in search results is that something we'll be able to do.
rep,yes you have a console through that you can make all those changes.
rep,you'll have complete control so initially in the ajax implementation for the poc itself which i'm talking for the first three months in this ajax you will have to constantly work with our team to make all those changes before the entire implementation is done through rt.
rep,but once you move into an api integration then you have full control on how you want to manage the products shown and everything the console along with merchandising gives you all the capabilities to change positioning change sort orders and all of that.
prospect,do we have to provide dictionary or spelling suggestions.
rep,the system will automatically correct for spell checks and synonyms but if you still.
prospect,for speciality <could be a lot of friends with oddly spelled names and a lot of products you don't find another places>.
rep,so for those things there is a place in the console i can just show that to you so it better to clear your confusion here you can essentially go and add any synonyms if you need to you have the ability to go and add any synonym create a bidirectional or a unidirectional equivalent for that on the console.
rep,but again even for speciality data since its machine learning platform if there is if there is a few instances where people look for that the system will automatically learn but if you do not want that you want that to appear correctly from the first word go then you can obviously use this tool to go and create a synonym as well.
prospect,there's a pause i'm going to give you the data for the month of november only 2 point 6 million page views or 1 point 9 million unique page views.
rep,okay i wanted that data <> okay and november is your ideal month is it peak more than one point nine million any other month of the year.
prospect,we would see more i would expect we'll see more in november and possibly january excuse me more in december and possibly january.
rep,so would it be a thirty percent more.
prospect,it's a good question i don't know yet.
rep,okay no no the only reason is because we usually provide a bucket for impression so uniques essentially so if you say 2 point 5 million is my peak i'll probably incorporate a bucket of about 25 million to 30 million impressions for the year for product recommendations.
rep,you've one month you might have higher impressions some month you might have lower impressions the overall for the entire year as long as you're under 30 million there will be no overages.
rep,but even if there are any overage charges are like very very small compare to.
prospect,okay yeah with the month of december we've already hit the so page views of 2 point 5 and unique page views of 1 point 9 and we still have another week and a half.
rep,okay so then potentially 2 point 5-2 point 7 million units is your peak so a bucket of 25 million for the year or at best is 30 million a year should be good.
rep,chris you have any other questions.
prospect,excellent thank you.
rep,and eric is there a number i can reach there.
prospect,five seven four two eight six two eight six nine six six six.
rep,thank you eric chris thank you so much feel free to ping me if you have any other questions happy to answer.
prospect,great thank you.
rep,thank you everybody bye bye.
prospect,are you there i'm trying to login.
rep,all right so do you want me to share my screen i can go ahead and do that i thought you were gonna just.
prospect,i'm on that going to meeting.
rep,let me share my screen maybe you could able to see that.
rep,all right you see my screen.
prospect,i went to that go-to meeting it's just spinning.
rep,oh okay i think it's just waiting for you to join in so.
prospect,should i try it again.
rep,yeah i think you should yeah.
rep,okay go to meeting okay great.
rep,yeah i think i can see you joining now yep i do all right <> instead i'll just make you the presenter hold on.
prospect,so you can make me to presenter that's enough.
rep,yeah okay .
prospect,what what screen do you see.
rep,okay i see your skype right now.
prospect,you see my skype .
rep,yeah now now i see it now i see your browser opening up  yeah.
prospect,okay okay you see the bluecoil.
rep,yep bluecoil dot com okay.
prospect,yeah okay so it's really two things number one site search and that that we already know you know what you have to offer the second part and i think this is what the main course is about and i mean this is what i need guidance is the filtered navigation.
prospect,what i want to do is split the filtered navigation into two parts so we've got filtered navigation like this and you know this section i need your guidance on  how to build it and i want it so it's really powerful because ultimately power going to be spotting is you're going to be sending people directly to product pages.
rep,hmmm.
prospect,so they're going to be landing on something like this and you know if they if they check out onto here i want this to be very powerful for them to be able to navigate the other side of things you you there was a company that monell was showing me they i forgot what the name was they sell like online up with gear and different stuff for the army you know what i'm talking about.
rep,us patriot yeah.
rep,which one. us patriot tactical is that the one he was showing.
rep,us patriot was it us patriot tactical.
rep,yep okay yeah yes i think you can remove the s okay ya thats fine.
prospect,so the other part to the navigation which i liked what you did was you had the brand landing page so let's just say you know under armor you had the this you know under armour section.
prospect,which is something that we would like to do as well so i i think that's the give you're the one that that you know control this area here correct.
prospect,so instead of instead of you know having clothing here you know so for us you know let's say you know i want to go to off the shock right i want to be able to give that look and feel you know for awesome right.
prospect,so if i go to off the shop if i go to  going to off the shop.
rep,we can we can take some of their some of their content right and we can utilise it whatever that whatever the content may be and then give that branded feeling on the landing approach so in terms of you know design and conceal and how that all is going to walk i need your input on that so just to recap like which you're going to completely do the left-hand navigation and then.
prospect,what do you call this i don't know what you call it.
rep,so just so you are currently on magento right. yeah okay great so and you want to make sure that we go ahead with site search and you also power all of your category basis right.
rep,the left-hand navigation yeah.
prospect,there is - there is two things that also and then the third is having i don't know what you call it i call it brand brand is it brand navigation yeah i don't know what you call it.
rep,the brand pages okay yeah yeah okay yeah.
prospect,yeah so yeah.
rep,alright okay so mark would you be having a staging environment for this as well at your end considering its magento .
prospect,would i be having what .
rep,a staging environment.
rep,i have a staging environment.
rep,all right so what we'd like to do is you know we would require an access to that just to make sure that we can analyse how your what are the different plugins that you've install just to kind of determine how will go about with the technical integration and from.
rep,and piece of perspective i guess i get i t you know one thing obviously you're looking for a site search coming in from our end in which includes the auto suggest which includes providing relevant search results and providing the left-hand filters that we have which are all multi select in nature but i just want to know you'r also looking for is powering your category pages so that's someone take some audio you wanna make sure that you can actually show in those pages coming in from unboxd as well and provide the whole multi selection feature like the facet section that we had in <> right so that's what you're looking for.
prospect,yeah just sorry just say that last thing again for the filtered navigation.
rep,yeah so the left side filtered navigation that you see when you are even going on a category page you want to make sure that also comes from unbox right .
prospect,yeah yeah of course.
rep,okay got you all right and so one thing you know just to let you know so obviously we will be providing multi select feature within these filters and facets that you see so that on more than one field attribute at any point of time now so that's going to be typically pretty similar to the functioning that you saw on us patriot but i didn't see you mentioned aftershocks so can you just send me let me know what are some of the specific designs it would want us to kind of concentrate on when it comes to that specific site.
prospect,well what i was saying is is is just to have the ability to make a branded category landing page .
prospect,so let me give you an example okay so we're at we're at the home page over here.
prospect,and i've got a brand feature here called astell&kurn now when i when i click it or let's do in case if that works okay when i click these over here i want it to take me to the same idea is what you have over here.
rep,so this this is like you know an extension of our search so what will happen is when you click on that if we take you to a search page with that specific search query and it will show you the results for that and you can obviously go ahead and merchandise products you see there to kind of you know look at different options or boosting options to show products in a specific sorting order that can be handled through search that's something we'll give you by default.
rep,okay and is there anything else any other specific feature that you want.
prospect,yes the only other thing i briefly discussed with <> so right now we don't if normally when you over over like military uniforms if you hover over you get this whole breakdown over here okay.
prospect,which is which is very useful but it's gonna take some time for us to build that.
prospect,what i would like to know from you is if i click audio you can hear i've got i put my categories here okay would that be a way for me to have my categories show up here.
rep,okay in the top menu no so that's okay so that's something that'll have to be configured at your end itself and as in when you configure that i'm pretty confident that automatically the unboxers team will take care of it and if you click on it just take how you do on u.
rep,s.
rep,us patriot you'll start showing in the relevant results but to top menu something that'll have to be done at your end.
prospect,so what you what do you mean by that and and if i wanted to do something like this what would that i take.
rep,okay so you want to have a top menu section the way they have is that.
prospect,i want to know i want to know what it would work what it would it take i want to know what what would it take.
rep,okay so if you want what i can do it i can give you a couple of examples of our some of our magento clients do that will that help you.
prospect,yes yes please please and i want to know if that's included in the price.
rep,okay so that's something that has to be  configured at your end but you know i can just always guide you how soon other customers do.
prospect,so this whole section here they take it themselves that you'r saying.
rep,they configured as in the designed it themselves they get the menu options coming in themselves and unbox just goes ahead and powers those pages that's the only difference but it has to be configured at your end for unboxd start to powering them.
prospect,okay okay okay so you're going to send me some options okay so here's what i need from you please send me a list of what you need me to get to you.
prospect,and then three tell me how long it will take you to get site search and left-hand navigation and then the brand the brand is landing pages.
rep,got you yeah.
prospect,okay yes please thank you.
rep,all right and is there anything else any other custom thing that you wanted to talk about from the requirement.
rep,so and any specific timeline that you are looking at for this specific launch is there something you have in mind any specific.
prospect,i'm trying i want to if you see over here i like to launch by march.
rep,gotcha okay all right i'll keep that in mind while they're just trying to figure out how gonna help you go ahead with this okay.
rep,experience and what we do for you as the provider as you know as the retailer is that we make this seamless for you because we've done this through machine learning so where other solutions or your current solution might require great deal of manual effort we we empower the system to find and to direct your users to the right information the first period the first time they they go after it .
rep,things like synonyms auto suggest things like that where you might having be having to do a lot great deal of manual work we do that automatically for you does that sound like something that you would be interested.
prospect,interested absolutely.
rep,what are you using right now.
prospect,so right now we're using magento we were on websphere commerce about two years ago.
prospect,but the manner in which websphere was created for us we had too many technical issues and the code was being crossed and in the end back in the day we had a when we integrated with websphere we had a team of five people doing e-commerce. and so therefore the system itself was way to resource and/or labour intensive for the teams that we had in place and so we prepared to migrate to the open platform of magento.
prospect,we've done so in the last two years but we haven't had exactly the support that we needed i guess we were a little naive thinking that we could do a lot of you know development ourselves. and today we're kind of taking a different turn where we're looking for partners to be able to leverage you know features that are already embedded and tested and working as supposed to spending a lot of our money doing you know manual development and so one of our areas where i think we not necessarily struggle but we can definitely have better visibility with regards to our product contents and also ensuring that we have uniformity and that we're leveraging the tools that we have.
prospect,right now we're working with the pin system called inriver and so all of our product information is being entered in a third-party device and then being fed through magento but i think even there there's a lot of things that we're not leveraging and so hence the interest of having solution where he pardon my lack of terminology but a machine does most of the work for us .
rep,so that's the beauty of unbox we're over six years old you know six and a half years old and the foundation of our solution is is all-around machine learning that's our secret source so how we were built. and even though it sounds a little bit trite today because everyone's talking about machine learning no one knew about it six years ago but our developers were innovative in the field. and we're able to incorporate that into our foundation that's what's given us really a sizable advantage within the marketplace.
rep,again it takes advantage of your existing content looks for the attributions looks for stemming synonyms things of that sort to be able to provide this seamless experience for your users without the manual intervention being needed on your site.
rep,is it 100% accurate no because we can't know everyone's business but you know it's at 85 to 90 percent accurate absolutely.
rep,so it's it's highly efficient and highly productive for you. and again what we have seen from our you know our large group of users that we significantly enhanced the conversion rate if users are going to have a better experience if they're going to find the products that they want the first time if they're going to we're going to be able to offer appropriate product recommendations for up-sell cross-sell conversions go up average order cart size those does things of that sort so it said it's a significant boost for our customers.
prospect,great so so ultimately you connect to obviously systems like magento.
prospect,or would you yes and so really it's with regards to enabling the search and ensuring that the right criterias come up and also populating the right or listing the the popular search terms making it so relation.
rep,yes yes so we focus on site search.
rep,so as people are looking for information we're delivering the appropriate information and so we're not requiring that things be spelled accurately we will do autosuggest we can understand different categories things of that sort.
rep,so the site search is significantly enhanced over what magento is offering you today again because of the machine learning we also will do category pages so specific landing pages so that if people are based on what the machine is learning if they're looking for certain categories we will automatically deliver those categories to them.
rep,we also will be making product recommendations so those are the three areas where we provide added value for your users.
prospect,is there anything with regards to like filtering and also let's say manual sequencing of products um so let's say i land on bras and then i navigate to something else do you have a feature that is just with regards to what appears in the listings.
rep,absolutely and not only that but because of machine learning we will also be doing automatic in boosting burying as far as and yeah who sinks certain categories or boosting the order that items will appear.
rep,within categories based on what your users are doing.
rep,and that again without your intervention this is all through the machine learning.
prospect,fantastic do you want to start going through a little bit of your doc and then out if we run out of time we can reschedule something at a later time or.
rep,sure we can start on this the doc takes about 20 minutes with questions things of that sort site i don't know we want to get started we want to go through another.
prospect,yeah maybe we can reschedule i wanted to have a conversation rapidly because we're doing our financial planning for the next fiscal year.
prospect,and then do it is due at the beginning of june but unfortunately i'm traveling for the next two weeks and so if we could reschedule something i have right now the 24th of may that seems like a good date and then if not it goes to the following week and it's starting to get a little hairy for our planning.
rep,letting go quickly through will focus on these five areas i i know timelines i want to make sure that we hit this so no surprise here these are the key areas within search that we are addressing i think this from our conversation already this is key for you.
prospect,so trial attended that'd be about right.
rep,yeah and then what we did in this study we actually were looking at your site and looking at things like t-shirts and if you type in t-shirts you're not getting t-shirts as opposed if you navigate to t-shirts you are going yeah what we would say that whether someone it's the task that people take should be completely irrelevant you want people to take whatever path through your site that is the most natural and comfortable for them and the results that they obtain should be consistent and should be the same this is important while they're on the site but it's also critical if they come back the next day and they try to find a product that they were browsing as they find the same products.
prospect,absolutely i agree.
rep,you know so and we go down and we have different examples here you know so for a different collection again based on search the search results are completely different from the results from navigation.
rep,and so we have examples like this that i would love to go through with you but and maybe it more time maybe we'll pick a date but to give you a better sense of how we deploy we deploy very quickly four to six weeks.
rep,and that's a realistic number and we're subscription-based so you pay monthly.
prospect,monthly.
rep,subscription base for us.
prospect,what and the the monthly subscription is based on the amount of search of search should be.
rep,the number of session.
prospect,products session.
rep,for site search it's the number of sessions and each session is up to 30 minutes as controlled by google so the number of monthly sessions that you have we will agree to a number ahead of time and and you know if there are overages there would be additional charges on top of that but it's a very friendly objective measure or for the subscription
rep,and then is the integration done through your teams are mostly through our partners.
rep,we will do the integration. okay .
rep,with ourselves.
prospect,and the integration cost is.
rep,there we will get into more information on that .
rep,do a little bit of scoping and look at what you have from what you're talking about right now my guess is that the integration would be you know it would be a one-time fifteen twenty thousand dollar charge somewhere in there you got magento you got it tim i don't see that as being highly complex but again i'd want to get into more detail.
rep,yeah i think we can make that work i know that session we will definitely make that work what time would work for you.
prospect,so i have either end of day at 4:00 o'clock or beginning so this is lunchtime i'd have something either at 1:00 at 4:00 or first thing in the morning around 9.
rep,and what time zone.
prospect,sorry eastern time.
rep,eastern.
prospect,you're in california correct.
rep,so actually in chicago.
prospect,oh so we're a same time zone or maybe an hour.
rep,i am thinking that the one o'clock will work.
prospect,and we will send you an invite and get that conform.
rep,yeah louk .
rep,hold on a second give me let me give you one second i'm gonna give you a quick answer on that.
rep,we are in denver that day so i just want make sure i think the 4:00 o'clock might be a little better for eastern correct.
rep,<yes you say did you say what>
prospect,i'm sorry i'm hearing everyone at the same time there's probably a lag in the call.
prospect,so you're asking is 4 is okay.
rep,no no i am asking is can you repeat the options one more time.
prospect,oh so i have 4 4:00 pm eastern time or a 1:00 pm eastern time.
rep,oh got it so 1 pm you'r correct luke 1 is correct.
rep,yeah i think the 1:00 pm will work so why want we do that.
rep,do you have an idea how many sessions you have any visitors maybe it would be helpful we can send you an email with just some metrics that would help us to so i think so we i have to go.
rep,estimate on the 24th.
prospect,absolutely just send me your question line and what i'll do is i'll have daniella his name is daniella pump eggsy send you all the info we're already good about general information.
rep,that's great because that will help make the call on the 24 even more.
prospect,yeah we have three websites and so well really sorry two websites so bikinivillage dot com levyonrose dot com the levyonrose dot com have the country sessions.
prospect,sorry international website yeah exactly so so we have french and english and then we have you us english and so he'll give you like the global on levy on rose and then i'll give you the information from bikini village separately we treat them separately.
rep,okay that sounds great.
rep,monal any other questions or justin before we jump off and you know you guys have.
rep,no i think this is this is perfect because i like what we can also do is include our more detailed analysis some of the questions you asked about being able to override and position certain things based on business requirements we can show you our console as well during the longer call which i think will be hard today so no more questions for me as long as you can get at least an hour from you marino its fantastic.
prospect,absolutely so an hour on the 24th of may at 1:00 and we'll be waiting your invitation i've blocked it off in my agenda.
prospect,fantastic thank you so much for your time and i apologize for the short amount of time i was able to give you today .
rep,appreciate it thank you.
rep,okay thank you thank you luke.
rep,and we work with a lot of large customers we we work with ashley furniture express route 21 we've just started working with hsn dot com and bed bath and beyond so we've been growing tremendously about 1200 e-commerce sites are powered using our technology globally about 120 plus right here in the us in the north america area we also have started to expand aggressively in canada we have you're talking to nbc fgl sports group que tienes etc so growing rapidly and we wanted to give you an idea of you know what we think is an opportunity and have a discussion with you to see if it is an opportunity or not.
rep,so we specifically focused on the site search component but i'll give you an idea on two pieces one is the site search component and second is also the the category pages that you have today on the website.
rep,so nick from your perspective how much focus is there on e-commerce i know you guys have physical brick-and-mortar stores as well but from that perspective do you are you guys investing in growing e-commerce or e-commerce is more of a discovery and then driving customers to the store.
prospect,no no no ecommerce is really really big really very important for us as any retailer as any retailer who's got a brick-and-mortar it's it's a crucial part of the goes.
rep,got it so from that perspective and nick from a challenge aspect before i get into what we think is the challenge is do you feel that product discovery on your site today is a challenge or it isn't a challenge what are your thoughts what are some of the biggest pain points that you feel today your team probably goes that's right as well.
rep,it's product discovery is a challenge well i look forward to seeing your analysis i you know what it wouldn't rank as my number one challenge these days my number one challenge my number one challenge with would be the low the lower conversion on mobile that would be my number one come my number one challenge i'm not saying that product discovery isn't important but it's not my number one .
rep,got it so nick from that perspective conversions on mobile are lower primarily compared to desktop is because what customers are seeing on mobile and how are they able to discover products and i'll tell you product discovery from that perspective is a very direct correlation to conversion let me show you a few elements so you can see what we we feel from our perspective and our our experience on the site.
rep,so we focus specifically on search and on mobile you would think you would see that customers actually search a lot more than having to use the navigation and we'll show you exactly why also so within search when you look at it you have five different components you have the relevance the auto suggest citizens and stemming error corrections and mobile obviously so let's right get into it so here what we were doing is searching for say jumpsuits on your site and i and i noticed that and i'll quickly go there in one second let's go here i'll just try to show you something that what i was trying to experience here so let's say if i was if i was searching for let's say blue jeans on the side so i get the first three products or blue jeans as soon as i scroll below i see a top more tops more top and you can see here this is the challenging product score so now if you were to look at it and experience it on mobile you see i have to if i wanted to find blue jeans what is my experience going to look like right i have to click here so click second click it's clothing i'll probably click here and then by the way if i click the jeans there's nothing happens i have to actually click on this arrow that's the other part then three oh then i have two colombians so four clicks to get two jeans and what you will see normally is customers will usually just come in and say you know what i just want to search for a jeans but what happens when i search for jeans on mobile i'll show you what that experience looks like also whatever knows.
rep,that could be the other bigger problem where the loading time is really long now we are i'm in chicago so i don't know if you have optimised the commerce only for canada and obviously for the us but if that is not the case if you have optimised it for the us then you know that is definitely something to look at so four to five clicks or five taps on mobile for me to actually get to the jeans versus if i click search here and i start to type in jeans but now see here also the challenges or if i'm on my mobile phone i still have to type this out hit enter or you know it girl and wait for the jeans search results to show up okay and in apparel as you probably have also noticed customers will look at a lot of products before they decide to buy right and you can see here i believe that your jeans have hundred and sixty-one matches so if i let's say now wanted to filter this out or sort by let's say i just want of some some of the cheaper jeans that i want but i have tops lots of tops some hoop rings i can't find the most inexpensive jeans that you have on the site and that is one of the only two sword options available if i wanted to filter now you know a lot of these sizes are mixed in because the results are not just jeans right so it's different sizes different conversions etc and then colour that also is such a important aspect to sort of narrow down the search results so this is the essential challenge if i wanted to just buy the most expensive jeans think about how much work that i have to do here now and that is why probably what mobile experience really looks like in terms of the challenge.
rep,now i can see that on desktop versus so if i here we were searching for blue jeans and here i searched for jeans so now what i will now do is i search for jeans but i wanted the most cheapest jeans so the most inexpensive ones and big maybe because i'm on a budget i didn't find them so now i will go and search for specific jeans that i now want so i'll go look for than blue jeans and what you'll find your search customers will give you a couple of chances to actually do this to get this right but if you don't get it right in a couple of chances they will leave and go somewhere else in shop and that is the biggest challenge now how do we make it easy i'll show you something.
prospect,are you live right now you're a live connection or you go.
rep,i am live yeah i'm going to your mdot.
prospect,because here's the funny thing here if anything i am actually typing the blue jeans in my my own smartphone and i don't get the same i don't get the same up but .
rep,oh really maybe because we are getting a different sorting for us is it.
prospect,yeah i could be yeah that could be yeah that could be that we've got different yeah yeah okay no that's it now.
rep,by the way how are you doing that nakano curiosity from a geolocation base this is like a canada in a non canada catalogue.
prospect,i think so.
rep,got it okay  i'm not sure got it okay so let me show you something that we do would express and i'll give you two examples of this i'll focus on mobile because that is something you're most interested in okay so here on expresses mobile site if i wanted to search for jeans as soon as i start to type in jeans you'll see everything that i want to show for jeans very quickly i have jeans for woman genes for men slim blue leggings jean leggings if i've gray jean versus jean jackets everything around jeans i can very quickly get them and get them to exactly where they wanted to go if i wanted to do for dress we don't make dresses for men right express this is like dresses from hand so you can see dress for only women shows that and now you have different kinds of dresses mini green shirts solid and these is based on machine learning that actually figures out what is it that the customers are most looking for .
rep,and what queries are they really looking to solve in most common most was the most popular and what's trending so all of that combined we give the best options to the customer right there if i'm on desktop you see what this experience really looks like now if i now look and go look at jeans you have a very visual engagement also and their stuff because you have a lot more space to do that also and i can now hover over these different options and actually see some of the best performing products for that option as well right so this is the interaction that is extremely important because in a parallel world you want to engage the customer visually and you want to get them attached and engaged by trying to start discovering products one after the other because they'll see a lot of products before they decide to buy one right so how can you expose the most number of products as soon as you get the chance to.
rep,now the next thing i was also looking at was i think dress so let me look at dress and the same thing happens and i get hundred forty six items oh sorry can you still see me or no.
prospect,i lost you you there.
prospect,i'm here now.
prospect,i see you but the voice okay .
rep,okay you can hear me now so yeah okay.
prospect,yeah i can hear you.
rep,okay got it i think there's probably introducing a one-second delay here but what i also do is i search for dress okay and i got 146 results and again if i start sorting and let's say go to this hoop ring okay hoop earrings you can see here you may also like i don't know do you guys do this manually by any chance nick the suggestions.
prospect,no it's some random algorithm from our e-commerce platform which is atg.
rep,okay got it so by the way express is also an atg and we want to give you an idea of why this is not necessarily the best option because in apparel customers evaluated a lot of products when i come to see these particular earrings i didn't really like them or i may not be so sure about them let's see if i really like them you actually want to show some other suggestions then go with that earring so maybe a necklace might be a good idea maybe a certain top or in jacket might be a good idea but what if i was not interested or i didn't assume you like these and i wanted to now evaluate the next one that i that you have in stock i now have to go back because i don't see any other option and to hide it again and then click here again and you can now see the challenge is it takes me three clicks to just evaluate in c2 products where is the experience you want to have is there continuously in the loop they come here they see other accessories or other group hearings or completing the look sort of the look book style or giving them other options there are similar to this one so other earrings and so they can continuously stay in that loop and you have the same truth in terms of tops so let's say if i am looking at this particular sleeve t-shirt you know what else am i looking at am i going to look at a dress am i right and i think this is probably a legging so maybe there's complementary products that you are showing but you also want to give them the option to see other similar products.
rep,so that's more of the product recommendations piece and then the last piece i want to show you is on the category pages so let's say if i go to dresses and jumpsuits so right now i'm looking at dresses and jumpsuits i have four types of dresses and maybe a jumpsuit.
rep,now from this particular option if i were to let's say look at these products and i say okay roughly forty to fifty dollars is the price point for these dresses right now if let's say i wanted to go on mobile and do the same thing so i'll go on mobile and let's say we'll click on clothing dresses and jumbsuits you're now seeing again a particular price point i think it's $35 on mobile so what you're doing right now and or maybe it is a different catalog for the us versus canada what you might be doing here is trying to see if we can show a particular set of products or not right.
rep,so here you're showing different sets of products on mobile you're showing different sets of products now the question is if your conversion on mobile is much lower possibly your average order value is also much lower and on your desktop maybe conversion is higher and your average order value is also much higher so in that instance if you are showing not the right kind of products based on what that variance in buying behavior is from mobile to desktop you are going to lose those customers on mobile and maybe in mobile you are doing that to say look you have a button blouse and i don't know why address is showing up as a blouse but but i think that you know and maybe that's what the challenge is you want to be able to show different set of products for because the buying behaviour on mobile and desktop is different and i'll tell you what where you might also see a different buying behaviour your channels when you do i'm sure you do run a lot of marketing campaigns you to email ppc social media organic seo etc.
rep,and you all these customers coming in from different channels you probably also see a variance in how they behave and you'll also see a variance in how customers behave if they come from different geographies right and i'll show you quickly what we also found in our study here it is.
rep,okay if i were to show you there we go i'll show you a sample states this is by looking at almost 500 apparel customers that we power today and just by figuring out products that were sold in california how many of them overlapped with new york only 3.
rep,9 4% overlapped with new york if i look to get texas and california only three point five five percent actually overlapped even though some of the weather patterns might be very similar between those two now let's say if i want to see device based you can see here on mobile you have a lot more visit contribution but look at the average order value is much much lower compared to say desktop and conversion rates are almost half or one-third almost.
rep,right so the challenge here is showing the same set of products first of all you want to show the right set of products but showing the same set of products on both different devices different geographies or even different channels is not going to give you the same conversion because people do buy differently coming in from they're from different segments.
rep,here's our segments are channel so this is the challenge that we help you solve nick we solve you we help you solve the relevancy problem so we actually end up showing if i'm searching for blue jeans we only show you blue jeans if you're searching for dresses you only show you dresses not earrings or hoop earrings or anything like that or tops.
rep,when you are talking about saying that mobile conversion is much lower than online conversion we have a way to optimise and segregate without creating landing pages mind you for that same category page for that same search results page in different product assortment for mobile customers and desktop.
rep,customers and all of that is done using our personification algorithm but you can also override the algorithm using our merchandising dashboard so today lets say.
prospect,so.
rep,yes go ahead.
prospect,so our our search if i'm not mistaken come from atg it must be i don't know as much but i think our search functionality comes from atg so so our so is this are you selling a software that that works for a search it from atg or are you suggesting that we buy a new search algorithm or.
rep,correct so we plug into atg and i'll show you how express did it so let's look at express here so let's say you find out search for dress sorry i clicked on jeans that's fine so.
prospect,express have to change their search they just overlaid your software on their search capability.
rep,exactly you got it you got it and this takes roughly four to six weeks to implement and go live .
prospect,why so long what's the big amount of work what's the.
rep,so the majority of the work is done by my team not yours all you have to give us is the catalogue so you give us a dump of your catalog and you integrate our analytics which is probably less than one day's worth of work and the third thing you do is you give us this access to this page so we can configure this page and the results around it and so some back and forth would be might be the design so let's say you we come in and say this is what the autocomplete we did for express if you want exactly the same kind then it shortens the time if you want some new design then there's that back and forth on design we'll design something you'll review it you'll come back and change it we'll do it again those are some of the times that takes and then we add some testing into it as well.
rep,so this includes development testing and the configurations to go live.
prospect,and we have some kind of case studies or results or increased ratio for express before and after.
rep,absolutely so let me open that up a little quick if you bear with me first we did a webinar with express also and we can show you what that looked like so just open up the webinars last page but we can share the link to our webinar also that you can look at okay there we go if you can see here .
rep,so and this we did the with the product manager express a webinar but here's the what the results are 18 percent increase in search conversions this is within the first 60 days of using us 32 percent increases in shoppers using site search 16 percent increase in orders from search and 20 percent increase in add to cart from increase in search and this is across the site by the way.
prospect,yeah so it has these are express results.
rep,these are express results correct.
rep,and over time this was just within the first 60 days and when we did the webinar over time this increase in conversion has now become almost 30 percent.
rep,so the more time you give the system because it's because it's a machine learning system it gets better and better to see what customers are searching what kinds of results are performing better and it automatically starts to get better and show better results.
prospect,okay so and you don't have so we don't have a responsive site right so we got two instance we've got you just mobile instance and the mobile instance so that would have to know from your perspective.
rep,i know so what we do is we also develop from that perspective a both i think you have an adaptive instance so one for desktop one one for mobile and our solution will be adaptive as well so it's not twice the amount of work it's slightly maybe 15% more work for us to configure slightly differently because some elements might be different on mobile but it's not 2x the work.
rep,and by the way the as piece nick is a guarantee so let's say i can show you some awesome numbers awesome presentation and fancy slides but you don't know whether what's reality and what is actually going to work or not work so we give you the option to do a poc trails for 60 days or 90 days which over your heart's content if we don't show you an uptick in conversion walk away no questions asked.
prospect,four to six weeks are your implementation.
rep,correct if you want some standard stuff more templated approach just to see a quick poc you can always improvise and optimise later also we can shorten the window time time down to almost four weeks.
rep,and from your team's perspective the only commitment you have to make is a couple of days to get us the feed to integrate our analytics and to give us site search page access rest of the work is done all by our team and then some time from your team to do some testing you obviously want to do some qa uat and the ability to take it live this that's it that's the only time when your team gets involved otherwise everything is done by us.
rep,got it absolutely more than happy to do so.
rep,do so how does the the pricing model works i've after the 90-day proof of concept how does the pricing model of work.
rep,so the pricing model works based on sessions the number of sessions that you have and we'll give you a big bucket so that if you have variability or growth that you're anticipating the price won't change regardless and we can also put together an roi model for you nick so let me show you what that would look like oh quick maybe one second i just i'm going to open something up here.
rep,okay so let's say can you see my screen still.
rep,okay so let's say i'm and these are just ballpark numbers and if you can share these numbers we can put your numbers in here and share this as well with you and we can sign an nda if that's what's required to give us numbers also nick so you can see here in cell d4 i was assuming you have let's say a million sessions let's say your conversion rate currently is at say 3% and your average order value is about a million about $100.
rep,so let's say you're making three million dollars from your search only let's assume this is just search we're talking about that'd be a good comparable number.
prospect,just give me 30 second hold on.
rep,no problem.
rep,i'm sorry i'm back in
rep,oh yeah no problem so if i'll just repeat myself so here if you're looking at site search visits or sessions per month let's say it's about a million and you get about 3% in conversion rate okay and let's say your average order value is about a hundred.
rep,if that's the case you can see that you're about roughly making three million dollars from search okay now if let's say unbxd comes in and only thing we change is your conversion rate improvement and we only improve it by say five percent you can see here by improving here by five percent you're generating almost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in incremental revenue and let's say our cost was seven thousand or let's say even five thousand.
rep,we are making about 30x the roi of what you are investing in us.
rep,perfect any kind of guidance on make on when you can have this meeting maybe in the next week next two weeks.
prospect,yeah well next week.
rep,next week perfect and is it okay to ask for a couple of pieces of information so that we can build this roi model for you.
prospect,well search site search visits per month would be in the area of for month old and then months let me to say so everyone could say we've got about 2.
prospect,5 million visits per month okay roughly speaking.
rep,sure and what would be the conversion.
prospect,i've got no clue on the search on the usual tier the users of the search i got no clue the order of our order value would be in the area 70 dollars.
rep,70 dollars okay what is your overall conversion rate nick we can maybe extrapolate from there.
prospect,the overall conversion rate would be in the area of overall mobile and desktop would say 1.3%
rep,1.3 so let's say i'll i'll make it up to 2% first search because search will be slightly higher well it depends on how much you said you get for search but let's say it's two percent roughly and so if you were to see today you're making roughly 3.
rep,5 million from search if at two percent would that be a fair estimation ballpark.
prospect,well if the two percent is right.
prospect,the rest is more or less online so this two percent is right here that would be it more or less this now.
rep,but but i've got no visibility on that two percent.
prospect,no problem but let's say okay let's let's make it the same as one point three that's also fair so then you're probably making 2.
rep,2 million from search and if you were to come in and increase say 10% so i'll just look at column d we're going to add two hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars in incremental revenue for you.
rep,and again if we were to make our price point let's say seven thousand instead you have 32x again.
prospect,yeah yeah i tried .
rep,is that sound like a fair price point nick to 32x all right.
prospect,yeah is that a loaded question.
rep,no no i the only reason i say this is what what we do from our guarantee perspective is let's say i come in and say based on what dale that we see we'll be able to do at least 5% and we'll come in and say let looks at 5% or cost is $5000 if you don't do five percent if you do four point nine percent you only pay as half of that you only pay as $2500 you don't pay us five thousand dollars because you might want to continue using us because we're at least doing four point nine percent you might not want to take us out and over time we might do eventually better.
prospect,well that's good listen i so so i'm intrigued enough let's proceed to next step let's have a let's have a meeting with my technical person in my in my product manager and let's take it to the next steps and we'll see if we should proceed to their constant.
rep,perfect and so nick will follow up with you right after this call we'll give you the presentation that we use to share and we'll reach out again if you don't hear back from you for a meeting sometime next week or the following week.
prospect,that's right.
rep,perfect thank you so much for your time nick really appreciate the opportunity.
prospect,thank you guys.
rep,all right thank you.
rep,some time since we've connected how are you doing
prospect,yeah i'm doing good i'm so having issues with my search
rep,okay how was the holiday season did you go through it fine everything
prospect,yeah was is good
rep,all right so i know jonah last time when we talked you were even middle of a lot of projects so you probably were not able to prioritize these our solution right how did the pipeline so i'm assuming that now is a good time to sort of reevaluate go back to where we were and see if we can prioritize it or
prospect,exactly okay
rep,so based on our last conversation just to sort of recap we were you were using search spring currently and you were also using some recommendations correct
prospect,no we're we are doing recommendations ourselves
rep,oh you were doing it yourself got it so what we were coming up with was trying to come up with a way to combine site search and recommendations in one package but still in the in the long term save you money compared to what you might be spare paying search spring today
prospect,okay cool
rep,all right fantastic so what we had presented last time was around 950 dollars per month that would include both search and recommendations
rep,fantastic okay and we also had a set up fee a small set of fee that we were charging now in the past the set of fees were slightly smaller unfortunately last year but since we are now doing a lot of things within search
rep,also a set up fees have gone a little bit higher up so so the set of fee is around two thousand twenty five hundred dollars
rep,one-time okay and you don't pay the whole amount upfront you only pay half up front and have after we've gone fully live and you tried our system
prospect,yeah gotcha
rep,okay so you pass a token amount and i'll tell you why we did this jonah because and it'll find it funny and so counterintuitive last year we used to do it for free in the beginning and what will happen is if there are competing projects for a retailer's attention because we are free they wouldn't pay attention to us and i probably
prospect,make sense
rep,for six months
prospect,so you listen i would pay attention to you if it was free
rep,excuse me so i owe you say that johna but i guarantee you another thing came up and it was a fire we will get side track because you were more invested in that so not that we we're trying to gouge you or anything like that it's just a question of just making sure that there's skin in the game from both sides and it's not that you're not interested in it mind you any of those retailers but they were all interested it's just that you have so many competing priorities that get need your attention on a day to day basis so where money is involved you always get you to get their attention so we feel that maybe right now you are in a place where you feel like that in a
rep,week it could change very easily so so that's what it is what what the only thing that's left for us to do is two things what you can expect one is you can go to the agreement again we'll send it to revise it and send it to take a look at it you sign it and then we want to see next piece we want to do is set up an implementation call so you would actually go through it know exactly what we're going to do what details we're gonna put what details were not gonna put and give you the timeline of exactly when we'll go live and then ultimately we you give us access to your neva platform we get started and we give you updates every
prospect,cool
rep,week we have a scheduled call every week to go through your requests our requests and within four weeks we get this up and running maybe it might take five weeks so that's typically the time frame
rep,does that sound like a plan
prospect,it does
prospect,uh yeah like let it tuesday
rep,tuesday let me just make sure i can give you a specific time so can you do 1:30 pm central
prospect,i can afford
rep,<> right
prospect,i'm eastern
rep,so 2:30 eastern
prospect,sure that works
rep,perfect alright so we'll send you a who else should be included on this call
prospect,just me for now and i'll figure it out
rep,okay perfect and in the meantime we'll also send you the agreement just if you can please if you can give us any feedback or at least get it executed from your end before tuesday that would really help export
prospect,okay awesome i will try my best
rep,alright it's a pretty easy read i promise you it's a little bit mean easy read
rep,boilerplate stuff like don't hire our people we won't hire your people don't tell our secrets we won't to kind of standard some
prospect,yeah make sense
rep,yep and it also clearly identifies what fees you pay what is you don't pay etc okay all right fantastic okay awesome so i'll get you this contract we'll send you a calendar it lights any questions that you have jonah i hope i'm not pushing you too fast if you have any questions i want to make sure we answer any of those questions no no right now
prospect,right now
rep,okay all right fantastic and can you tell me what is your current vendor agreement ending just so that i know what the absolute timeline is for us
prospect,well i thought you guys would i thought the whole thing was like you guys potentially buy us out of that those he will we discussed before but i believe that someone sent it might be end of june
rep,end of june got it so that would be easy so we can go through april in may get it all tuned up and running you tried in june we can get you one month where you don't have to double pay and starting july you pay
rep,is it possible can you do me a favor jonah maybe for me to get that money month of free trial can i get a question you send me maybe one of your invoices or the agreement that you have
rep,i can run
prospect,sure
rep,it up the flagpole and say look because of competition this is the adjustment we need to make should be any easy approval i just need something to sort of put behind it that's all
prospect,okay all right look through
prospect,looking for
rep,it so are we jonah have you been waiting for quite some time so thank you for the opportunity thank you for remembering us and if it really appreciate get chance to prove this to you
rep,all right fantastic thank you sir
prospect,okay bye
rep,anything else jonah do any do we need to do do we need to
prospect,no i think we're good
rep,okay all right awesome fantastic
rep,all right bye
prospect,hop off so i'm just giving y'all heads up so that maybe we can get through it in that amount of time.
rep,generally we do in an hour but what i can do is i can at least give you the initial introductions for today and probably reconnect either later in the day today or tomorrow <i think it works for you>.
rep,so one quick question i had chan so i did review the site so i wanted a specific context on i do understand that you are a great alexa rank you've a good number of visitors on the site. but the number of products on the site obviously are probably about 50 products so was there any specifically issue that you have when it comes to search or navigation or recommendations that you wanted us to look at so that i get a better context while we get into the presentation.
prospect,sure no i took the call you know i didn't reach out to y'all go reached out to me and i took the call because i know that i don't spend a lot of time thinking about our site search. and i know that it gets used and like you said we don't have a lot of products and a lot of our product are similar so really i took the call just to see if what you guys are doing are interesting to me. and if you know if there really is no opportunity for us you know spinning done time and effort toward our site search.
rep,absolutely that that helps me a lot so they're definitely opportunities are identified but i just wanted to understand the background context to this. but then thanks so much for this <> so i know the interest of time so i'll cover the primary element today and then we can look at the dashboard and specific deep dive feature when we have probably 30 more minutes either later in the day or later this week is that okay.
rep,awesome okay so my name is sharath so i lead sales for unbxd for north america region so what we had today was an agenda where wanted to spend about 60 seconds to tell you who we are. then wanted to look at what is the opportunity for us on kontrolfreek dot com look at a few elements as to where we believe is the opportunity for unbxd and then take you through specific elements of site search that we believe that we've done a fairly good job. and take you through live examples and snapshots with customers who are live with us that gives you a better perspective then look at the two other elements of product discovery that we manage. which also as category navigation and recommendation as well and then towards the end of the call is when i want to take you through our dashboard and show you how easy is it to merchandise using unbxd. and then also discuss pricing and integration steps so this was the overall agenda exact plan for about 60 minutes okay.
rep,awesome so a quick description of who we are san francisco based company offices in sunnyvale san mateo we have about our core engineering team our product team our technology team will work out of san mateo office.
rep,i work out of san mateo as well but this week i am in chicago we have our customer success team in chicago because we have a bunch of customers in this region. plus we have a back end team in india as well because of the number of customers we have in the apac region so we have a mini unbxd in india. all our teams are also replicated there so that we ma can manage all the asian asian customers and the european customer in a more effective way. 1200 customers globally about 300 plus in the us in the last 12 months we have grown at an exponential pace we've added more than 200 customers in the us in just the last 12 months. in terms of pure-play scale we managed more than 750 million interactions a month at this point in time and but even then we are an extremely cost effective solution. hence we believe that today and going forward we will be the king of product discovery a quick snapshot some of the customers we work with.
rep,target primarily for their international sites newegg second largest retailer in the world ashley furniture the largest furniture store in the world express bells outlet. in the process of integrating cvs pharmacy hh gregg bed bath & beyond they should all be live by sometime in june we also work with a lot of pure-play online brands. deborah lippmann parts warehouse shindigz puravida sylvane to name a few.
rep,and the beauty of the product is its platform agnostic you could be on a standard platform with magento i guess you're in magento if i'm right.
prospect,we we are on the magento community.
rep,okay okay yeah so you can basically be on any platform our platform our solution works seamlessly irrespective of the platform you are on okay any questions.
prospect,so this can integrate with magento as a module or as an extension.
rep,yeah we basically have a plug-in built in so we can integrate it seamlessly with magento.
rep,so quick understanding  of the current opportunity on kontrolfreek so when we look at looking at an effective search solution we look at four elements sorry four elements chan. so one is the autocomplete feature autocomplete or the type-ahead feature on the site which we believe first search experience for your user and we believe that have visual and guided right. the second element we look for is the relevancy element search so how relevant the search is right the third element we look for is how error tolerant the search is does it auto correct single word multiple words how error tolerant it is. the fourth element is how mobile-friendly it is is it mobile responsive or does it work with mobile apps and what are the results of that. so we believe we have four primary elements that drive search today right. i looked at your site so the first thing which is the autocomplete feature is something i did not find you do not have the typo ahead on the site which i believe is an opportunity for unbxd to come in.
rep,and help you with and i will show you examples of a why it is important and the depth of our implementation when it comes to autocomplete. the second thing i look for is search relevance i assume the few use cases that in in terms of your gaming world people might come and search by using the specific theme. in this case the theme could be typing something a specific product with a game name right so i looked for call of duty grips. i looked for a mortal kombat thumbsticks i look for results on red shields i know you only have one red shield in your inventory and everything else is a blue shield. so you probably are showing me blue fields but i'm just looking at from a relevance stand point right then i looked for again a specific armor for call of duty. then i looked for zombies thumbsticks when i do zombies thumbstick i actually get one result but when i do thumbsticks i do not get any results.
rep,so it's just trying to understand which is clearly that as you said you've probably not spent too much time in search. so i do believe that there's a lot of opportunities that we can bring onto the table from the search alone but beyond search what we also believe i might take you to some of our recommendation widget. though you have lesser number of products there is definitely use cases where you can sell more than one product in a single iteration. and it is also nice to show some nice recommendation widgets when people are browsing through your site which we believe is a huge value add that we can bring on to the table without you having to do anything manually. we can actually do these things in an automated manner any questions so far. okay so when i talk about the elements of site search so i spoke about the four elements the first element was the autocomplete.
rep,so what i want to do is to take you through three specific customer examples that will give you a perspective on how we manage autocomplete today.
rep,and what you would notice if you look at the search word you look at competitors that of a unbxd like an <sli or a bumerich eh or a next opia or a search spring>. what you would generally notices is they are all templatized an autocomplete experience you would you go to ten different customers of theirs you would see the same template that is being used for autocomplete. but what we primarily believe is autocomplete should serve two purposes one it should be visual and guided for your customer and second it should basically enhance or highlight your business differentiator.
rep,and it should solve for a specific use case so you would see three examples now of three different verticals and you would actually see depth of customization for each of them right.
rep,first one is parts warehouse so if you look at their site before they came on to unbxd this is an archived site what you would start noticing is distinctively two elements. one where a customer can because this was because they have different kinds of customers one customer who would probably come and search by a part number and another customer would come and search by a model name. so what an at the back-end what they had is all these information stored on two different databases. so they thought the best way to solve it is to have two search boxes one to search by part and one to search model right. but then the issue is when you have two different search boxes it is now a you are putting the onus on the customer to come and pick up the right search box. b we all know how difficult it is to optimize for a single search experience here you are expecting to optimize for two different search experiences.
rep,and third from a rel- relevancy standpoint all the results will get skewed because now you are pulling in data from two different sources. so what we did is we understood the business use case and here on their site today if you go and type bissell which is a model available on their site. what you would notice is on one side you would see parts the other side you would see models and below you have all the recommendation widgets. which shows all the top search queries for something starting with b i s s right another example apparel world us patriot they're roughly about a fifty five million dollar retailer. they sell military apparel to non military personnel and their specific use case was a they had a fairly large inventory which had some very very well-known brands say like a nike. but then major differentiator was they actually sell brands from they sell products from very niche brands which a common user might not know.
rep,so they wanted their autocomplete to expose user to brands which is not easily well known right and the second business use case they had was they had they sell expensive products so they wanted a more visual tour of all the popular products on their site. so here if i type in n i where i am probably intending to type nike first i given nice category scope okay nike and in nike these probably are the three top clicked products. or categories with the machine learning of have had in the last few days it will also tell me that there's something called as nine line apparel and night-vision goggles is available on the site. and it will also give me all the top queries for something start with ni then it gives me a visual tour of all the popular products available on the site starting with ni. again if you look at examples 1 & 2 completely different business use cases this <> the look and feel is completely different and customized to solve that business use case. the third example i want give you is again in a very very different vertical online grocery these guys are the largest online grocer in southeast asia.
rep,they were in the news just last week because they raised hundred and fifty million dollars in i think series b or series c funding. and they had a very specific use case in grocery world i which might be similar <>.
prospect,<hey sharath i think i am not getting you clear> okay okay i am getting you now sorry about that.
rep,no problem i think l have a slight i'm working at a hotel today because i'm in chicago so internet might not be great.
rep,so yeah so in grocery the specific use case they had was one they had customers who'd buy a lot of products in a single transaction. so they wanted a simpler way to add products to cart which could be a case in business case in your case as well where someone might come in and buy a grip and a thumb stick in the same transaction. and they wanted the section to be completely personalized because if you look at the grocery world i'll probably go and buy say milk egg and a chicken every single week. how can you personalize the entire autocomplete experience for me in a very personalized way so that i buy faster and i feel good about buying on your site right. so here if i go and say start typing in chicken what you would notice is we've given an option to change quantity and all add products to the cart right from the search box. we also display up a banner on their site we also show them all the commonly searched terms we show them all the popular brands and the categories of chicken.
rep,completely personalized for this user and then as a user if i buy chicken without skin <>.
prospect,hello hey sharath can you hear me.
rep,okay i don't know where i lost in between i'm sorry about that.
prospect,hey you're back everything froze for a bit.
rep,i just realized that i was actually i had put my phone on a hot spot and my phone went out of battery.
prospect,no no worries you are back now.
rep,okay where did i lose you did you hear about the big basket.
prospect,can you say that again sharath.
rep,i'm not sure where i where i lost you did we did you hear about big basket <>.
prospect,yeah it was just about 30 seconds probably.
rep,okay so the <>.
prospect,i saw the drop down on chicken and you had just said so say we bought chicken without skin that's that's where it froze.
rep,yeah so i was mainly referring to the personalized section that if i'm a user who buy say chicken without skin chicken without skin shows up to me on top. but if you buy say chicken with skin chicken with skin shows up to you on top.
prospect,yeah gotcha.
rep,right so the one thing that i wanted to wanted you notice is with all these three different use cases what we have done is we've completely customized the autocomplete experience for your business. we've not kept it standard. but we wanted to solve a specific problem and when we come to your site we basically make sure that whatever is the business and differentiators for kontrolfreek we help you solve that.
rep,any questions so far i know we are already done 20 minutes so i just wanted to pause here and if you have any questions we can take that or you can let us know when can we reconnect again.
prospect,yeah no no i'll let you know if i have any questions it all may make sense so far.
rep,awesome so after the autocomplete the second thing that we do chan is from a from a relevancy standpoint if you look at any e-commerce system will today even the system that google itself. primarily what they do is they do is very dumb text pattern match to what is actually typed on the search box nobody tries to understand the context of what you've actually searched. so when we started building our product the first thing that we did is we looked at multiple use cases on every e-commerce site. where we started analysing that you go to any retail site or any customer could go to any retail site primarily the number the number of buckets of the types of query that a customer would look for falls under these 12 buckets right.
rep,you could go on an e-commerce site search by say a part number it could be a model name or it could be a product type or it could be like a specific theme. and you go to the apparel world and you say casual shoes formal shirts party trouser right that could be a theme or you could go and search by natural language where you might go and say footwear under $100 right. so there there are basically 12 types of searches that actually happen or any kind of an e-commerce site. so what we have done is as a foundation of our platform built algorithms that can resolve each of these 12 types automatically without having to create anything manually on the system right. since we've done this foundation of the platform a lot of these attributes start <coming in> as foundation as well the first thing is the ability to be error tolerant right. we not only correct a single word but we have the ability to correct up to six words in a single search phrase if you look at this example black leather jacket.
rep,we've misspelled each of these three words incorrectly the system has understood the context where it's where the system understands that jacket is a product type leather is actually a fabric attribute and black is a colour attribute. it will not only auto-correct it but will also start displaying the right kind of results from the word go right. the second that we do is stemming right so we understand dress dresses shoes shoes wood wooden center central console consoles there are all stemmed words. we start automatically resolving them and start displaying consistent search results so it avoids you even if you have like in your case you have a much smaller catalogue. let's say 50 products but 50 product names just imagine the amount of iterations you'll have to build. even this for 50 products for the stemmed words and error correction right you'll have to then start going and manually building a corpus at the back end.
rep,but with unbxd it starts getting resolved automatically right but if you have if you are in a specific industry where you have to still build something which is like an industry jargon. like we have a customer who sells weightlifting gear and in their world shoes are called lifters right there's no way unbxd can recognise that. so if there are any specific jargons on your site we still let you build synonyms you can build a unidirectional synonym you can build a bi-directional synonym or a replacement synonym. i'll show you the example on dashboard as to how easy to build these synonyms right but apart from these specific cardinal cases generally you don't have to build any synonyms or stemmed words or spelling mistakes which will resolve automatically on the platform.
prospect,yeah i got it.
rep,the other element that we do <> the other element that we do is automatically is automated redirects. if a user and comes and types a specific thing on the search box which matches the category that you have right <>.
prospect,so this is really the only thing that i've done currently do some automated redirects for specific searches.
rep,correct and this is <>.
prospect,<> the only thing that i've done on search.
rep,yeah so yeah this is something which is the foundation of the platform and you don't have to build anything for this. chan so lost you.
prospect,no i'm here.
rep,okay okay yeah so again i just want to stop here chan because i know you said you want to do a hard stop in 30 minutes. next what i wanted to discuss with you was specific ui elements that we can help you configure in an automated way and then talk to you about the dashboard. so i can pause here and we can reconnect either later in the day or anytime in this week for your convenience.
prospect,no i'm saying what may make sense search for us you know i'm sure that there are a lot of other things that you guys do we are going to be fairly price sensitive especially for a tool like this. so if you're comfortable with reviewing price i think that makes sense because if it's you know not in the ballpark for us then you know then.
rep,i absolutely understand so all i need for me to give out the price a i understand that your catalogue is roughly about fifty products which is your parents skus. if you can also let me know what's your overall page use a month i can give you a pricing right away.
prospect,sure so what did you say you were going to be looking at.
rep,we look at the catalogue size and we look at the page use per month or sessions per month.
prospect,ohh sessions per month.
prospect,yeah let's say sessions are going to be somewhere around i mean it's different different times of the year let's say half a million.
rep,half a million sessions and about 50 products right.
prospect,yeah for individual skus yeah we did you say fifty.
rep,five zero.
prospect,yeah five zero yeah that will be good enough.
rep,yeah so generally for this ballpark you would be looking at a pricing for search roughly about $600.
prospect,okay that's $600 a month.
rep,yeah 500 to $600 a month yeah that will be the number that you will be looking at.
prospect,okay that's good <> six hundred dollars a month let me look at my budget for the year and you know another thing is i've got to try to get and wrap my head around what's hot with the impact i think it's cool like this could provide.
rep,and what we do is chan say we give you the three month break down where we come and say implement the product in under two weeks it do not take us more than two weeks to implement the product. and we let you use the product for the first three months and at the end of three months you can actually make a decision right and for the first three months you don't pay us the full value. you only pay us 50% of the invoice and only if you choose to continue after three months is when you clear the remaining it's in our way we are basically sticking our neck out. and we're saying that we will come an implement and we will show value and if you don't see value there's nothing as a fine print of the contract that will hold me back for a year you're free to walk away.
prospect,okay so you're saying the way the trial works let me just restate it make sure i heard it correctly.
prospect,you integrate the tool into our site and we use it for three months the half price and then we decide at that point whether we want to continue at full price.
prospect,yeah that sounds fair <>.
rep,and see the primary reason we do this is because i can go on about this for the next two hours but the point is this is not any theoretical thing right. what works for another customer might not work for you right so the best way to do it is what we have done is we've reduced that implementation time drastically. so that we can come and show value integrated it in like one to two weeks and quickly start showing value if you see the value you continue if you don't see the value you might as well be better off doing it yourself. so we want to make that impact and that's why we want to make it easy for you to test it out and then see if it makes an impact or make sense to you or not.
prospect,okay well what is the typical integration in effort from my end.
rep,so very little from your side so all these autocomplete the design elements we told right we will show you the designs you basically pick which design makes sense to you. or if you have your we'll still use your same style sheet same template same fonting everything it just that the design we'll just show you you approve or disapprove. we do the coding at the back end all the work that you have to do is only once we actually put it on your qa environment you test it out whether it makes to you. and then you put it live because all these intelligent things the machine will learn itself that the day you start integrating we'll put a tracker on your system. so that the machine starts understanding as to what is the behaviour on your site and it'll start making intelligent decisions itself so there's very little effort required from your side.
prospect,the screenshots that you showed were on desktop the tool function well on mobile.
rep,yeah we've built to work on mobile devices because especially in countries like asia now that we work we have like a 70% mobile penetration rate. so like they will like one of the recommendation widgets this is how it will work on a desktop like where it's same more like this or see similar product. it'll open up in a modal window when a mobile device it works like this the same autosuggest on a mobile device works like this.
rep,yeah so all these works seamlessly on a mobile device also hello.
prospect,okay gotcha gotcha <> okay.
rep,thank you so much chan wonderful talking to you and look forward to connect with you again.
prospect,yeah yeah right back at you thanks y'all.
rep,thank you bye bye.
rep,carlos again thank you so much for the time i did speak to kiran yesterday he did brief me about the current requirement where we do understand you use endeca today and you were looking at our recommendation solutions.
rep,to to first understand the product and then probably at some point in time look at our search product as well so is my understanding correct.
prospect,no we are using core metrics currently to drive our product recommendation so with our agreement with ibm we are able to get on digital analytics for the site and also the recommendation engine so they kind of compete with each other but here we're not so happy with core metrics for our web analytics. and so we're planning on phasing this out this year but if we do that then we will lose the ability to have product recommendations on our site so as we are looking forward to us we tune over to google analytics you need to come up with a new solution for our product recommendation. so last year i have one of my direct reports <nutritional car brera> reach out to you and you know several other vendors and he came back on his recommendation to look a your technology for our site so that's the immediate need. yes we do also use endeca and endeca also has a product recommendation engine built into it however we don't have a very new version of this <> a product recommendation so we should upgrade endeca <> now what i need is increase in our margin or the number of a line-item for our order. network speed maybe the thing first is what we have now core metrics the core metrics side of the product recommendation very very unuser friendly it's overly complicated any of the reporting capability is very difficult to understand. so even i myself have trouble understanding why <tom> benefit or product recommendation site right now i'm sure they're having some kind of impasse but i can't quite hate what scientist to be.
prospect,honestly what i will do is that look at you know what core metrics is giving us and then kind of see well with better technology of unbxd and more user-friendly and different algorithms available okay we're gonna maybe increase like some percentage. so i'm having kind of a difficult time writing up a business proposal to switch over to unbxd and that's what i'm really looking for today you see you know how i can go about building out a business cape to switch over to you.
rep,absolutely yep thanks so much for this detailed background thanks a lot yeah so we can i can definitely do that so here's what i would wanted to do let me just a agenda can you see my screen right now.
prospect,it says mooremedical site search yeah.
prospect,okay yeah i can see it now.
rep,good okay so so what i wanted to do as a brief background was a give you a brief introduction about unbxd what we've done probably the last 12 months i'm sure we would have spoken about it and understood <listed good for>. then i want to take you through more from our technology logic beyond how i recommendation platform is built and then give you quick customer examples of the some of the customers we are working with where we actually they use product recommendations and the use cases in which each of them use these product recommendations so from a recommendation system point.
rep,this is what i want to talk to you about and from a pure value proving standpoint carlos so one thing we do do with each of our customers is an intact is a thing called evaluation period so we have a 90-days evaluation window with every customer we work with. where we come on board implement the product and you use the product for 60 days post go live and you will actually see the benefits associated with a product product live before you actually commit to a decision. what we'll generally seen that within 60 days you have enough time to build a business case with actual numbers for your web asset and that will be much more easier for you take it to the management rather than showing thing in theory. because as of now you would probably have to look at some case value of what i'm showing you on the site and probably look at a few references but search and recommendations are so intrinsic to every customer that what might work for somebody else might not work in the same way for you. so the so what we've seen is this approach has helped us win a lot over the last 12 months than it ever had and come from our instructive so.
prospect,did you say 60 days or did you say 90 days.
rep,so we call it a 90-day evaluation because the first 30 days we use it for implementation and the next 60 days we use the product physically.
rep,so that's typically we approach today we can talk about that so what we usually do is we discuss the pricing once everything is done then the only expectation from customer is whatever is the implementation of the setup fee the customer pays a small portion of that and nothing else for the next 90 days. so we put our skin in the game we implement the solution you use the product and after 90 days you take a decision whether to move ahead or not if you do not move ahead everything else is waived so you don't have to pay anything else you don't have to pay either remaining of the implementation fee or the monthly fee.
rep,so in that in this in such a situation also wanted to give check with you do you also wanted me to take you through a little bit of our search platform as well or just stick to recommendation.
prospect,alright at the end.
rep,we can do it towards the end okay so yeah so let me give you a quick background who we are shouldn't take me more than two minutes. so we are a san francisco based company we have two offices here one in sunnyvale one in san mateo our core integrating product marketing teams work out of san francisco mostly in our  sunnyvale office. we've a stable stay work of excitement our san mateo office me and a couple of guys work here from san mateo then we have our customer success team out of chicago our svp mr monal patel works out of the chicago office plus we also have our international operations in india. because we have a huge presence in asia-pac region we are in fact the leaders of search in that market so we also have a good enough presence in that market as well. 1200 customers globally in the us we have expanded our customer base from under 100 last year to close to 350 right now a lot of enterprise customers we've on boarded in the last one month there's a huge number of ir 500 and ir 1000 customers i can give you a quick snapshot on that. in terms of pure scale we currently do over 750 million interactions a month and despite having a great product we are extremely competitive in our pricing hence we believe that today and going forward will be the king of discovery.
rep,snapshot on our enterprise customer based work with target newegg newegg second largest e-commerce site in the world in the us based in la ashley furniture the largest furniture store. bells outlet bells burks uutlet we've also recently started working with cvs pharmacy we we currently have a poc going on with us auto parts again an endeca customer who's moving on our to unbxd for both search and recommendations. and we we will be going live with express this week they have six hundred stores across the us over 60000 product skus on their catalogue they are going for both search recommendations and hh gregg early next month. so a large amount of enterprise logos going who's already gone live and going live with unbxd we also work with a lot of bands deborah lippmann a cosmetic brand of new york. vac parts again in the midwest and shindigz puravida and sylvane just to give you a fairly amount of depth of our platform and these are only online giants.
rep,and we are platform agnostic you could be on a custom platform or it could be on a magento prestashop a big commerce platform we can integrate extreme seamlessly so this is a quick background who we are any questions so far carlos.
rep,awesome and carlos at also instances if probably after talking about recommendation i can talk to you about search where we could build a business case help of help you build a business even for search if there if you see issues with endeca we can work with our search solution in a way. initially we can co-exist with endeca and once the team is completely comfortable say over the next six months to eight months we can there also replace endeca so we can work that out as well again i leave your judgement to you but just thought of let you know that this is possible. okay so from a product recommendation perspective so the approach we took was we said okay let's look at four popular themes that primarily govern how user behaviours today on an retail site and we started building in widgets looking at the insights we got from these four themes right.
rep,so then when we started figuring out these things so what we looked at was on any retail site so one theme that is very important to capture user metrics is popularity right so when we say popularity what unbxd does is we go back up to six months of user data that we collect it would be a new user or it could be a repeat user. and then popularity theme we primarily start packing is the day we start doing our implementation we enable the tracking on your site and what we start tracking is a what is the product being bought on the site what categories of product are being bought what are the locations that these <p> products are being bought so say musil drops is being bought from people in midwest versus flu shorts in la and so those informations starts getting tracked. and based on the specific popularity associated either with the category or with a product or from a location these popularity theme starts getting populated for your top ranked products and we also determine as to where they should appear on the site as well right so that's the first theme we started building an algorithm for our back end. the second theme was something called as wisdom of the crowd so here what we did was we looked at collaborative behaviour a we look at the entire popular trend on the site as to what product is hot and what is not selling really well. and second we also started looking at what the users are specifically buying from a specific location to start determining what could be the right product to upsell to a specific user and what is the right product to cross-sell. like this is where our user groupings where ten people who bought say flu shots also bought three of them also what nasal drops right ten of them who bought say a band-aid also bought cotton rolls right.
rep,so all these users grouping of information is what we start doing so that we can show the right kind of product to a cross-sell and the right kind of product to up-sell and i'll show you some live examples also so that you get a better perspective. the third thing we start doing is we start looking at when you upload the catalogue we also start looking at the pdp pages and start understanding the content or the description of that specific product and here is where we have a limitation. where we can only do it for english and latin based languages we can't do it for two byte characteristics like chinese or japanese.
prospect,yeah we don't need that.
rep,yeah so this is where we need to understand the product what is written in that product so that we can start showing similar products that will help the customer to do alternate product discovery right. so you might as a user i might come and search for bandages i have seen it on your site you've bandages from multiple companies right multiple brands right so as a user how can i see what is right for me and what is not and how can i see it in a in a very quick single-fold window on my webpage. so i can make a decision faster so showing similar products something like more like this as a recommendation we did or show or showing products or alternate product discovery is what we do with the content thing. and the fourth on the fourth one that we do is is is the algorithms that we've built in for the entire personalization theme and personalization we start looking at what we call implicit user behaviour. so we look at where the user is coming in from which location is he or she coming in from is he a new user or is she repeat user right and what's the seasonality associated with that location. so if a user is coming in from la what did the last people coming in from la from the last 30 days actually by on your site right and then we look at any seasonality associated with la as a location and then we start showing in the right kind of recommendation widgets so that way the user is more likely to buy right.
rep,so these are the four themes in which our entire recommendation platform is built and we've had algorithms and collaborative filtering options which are all free built into the platform so what you have to do is just install installing those widgets and the tracking device. and then where the widget has to be shown what widget has to be shown at what stage of the user experience this is all something which is completely managed by our big data system so there is nothing that you will have to actually do it the backend manually at all. the system will be intelligent enough to start understanding there are a few widgets which i'll show you where probably we need some inputs business inputs from you so that we can do the right looping of products initially. but otherwise it's a very very self learning system which should every passing week starts being much and much better which when it starts showing the right kind of recommendation and one thing which you can also do i'll have to figure with core metrics if we have a connectivity available. generally if it's google analytics what we do is we a consume the google analytics data so that even if we are starting a product recommendation platform today we look at at least i'll have six months data consume that data and basically in a very layman's term train the system with that data so that it becomes more and more intelligent from the day one it actually gets started.
prospect,ohhh.
rep,so i've to figure out from a for core metric as to how can we consume that so that we can feed that to the system right. so now what about probably instead of giving you more detail expansion i thought i'll take you to some live customer snapshots so that you get a better perspective on what each of these things mean right.
rep,so this is what we've built for puravida bracelets they sell bracelets and if you go to their site and if you search for say a bracelet or you look for bracelet that you only find that right. so in such a case what will a customer who is probably logging into the site it's just that how will we how will you personalize something for that specific customer so this is a real-time personalization widget we've got where we looked at it's <> this is a widget shown for a repeat customer. where a customer has bought a product in his previous transaction he's returned and we tracked user behavior for six months we can also change it to one year or three month the way your requirement is for them the requirement is for six months. so depending on what he had bought in the previous transaction so the moment he lands in the site this is the first thing he sees he sees something this name can be changed for them since it's bracelets they said it's hand-picked just for you. and you show him specific set of bracelets that he could probably he or she could only be interested right from the word go right. this is a widget for the top sellers on the home page again it the where exactly this thing appears it usually appears on the home page just below the banner.
rep,when a customer logs in and what products they are shown as i told you they using the popularity logic as to what the products what are the products that are bought on your site for the last 30 days or 90 days or six months. and if i'm a user logging in from san francisco what are the popular items are people from san francisco bought on your site this is typically what comes in the top sellers widget on the home page any questions carlos.
rep,and another example is as i told you its based on the content theme this is for doing alternate product discovery there could be multiple reasons why i like this specific bracelet but there are multiple of such bracelets right. so the best way to do is to show products right below the primary product so that i don't have to go and spend more time in the system looking for similar products but you've already hand-picked five specific products for me. which are similar to this product i can quickly look at everything in a single fold and then take a decision whether i want to buy this product or not buy this product so this is where our collaborative options start coming in for start showing the cross cell widgets this is what i gave you as an example right. what we do is okay of the ten people who bought a humidifier on my site five of them actually bought a filter right when i start having those metrics with me the moment somebody picks or select humidifier into add to cart we immediately start showing them all the products related to that humidifier so that we help in increasing order value right. the other thing that we do is upsell that we know that of the five ten people who have bought a nail colour two of them actually also bought a lip colour along with it and probably three of them bought the lip colour of the same colour as the nail colour right. so we look at those metrics and start showing this during checkout so that the customer is more likely to add that product and your average order value will also increase this is based on the tag recommendation right.
rep,this is again based on the content theme i am selecting the specific product i also show different colours of the same product so that if at all i still have doubts with choosing a specific colour i can basically make a quick selection on the cart page itself.
rep,so this is something that we do by default for so if there are if there is any case that a customer lands in a zero results page on your site instead of showing him a bad page what we do is we add these two recommendation widgets. and the intent of these two widgets is this actually we just recently viewed gives an option to a customer to go back and this is your top seller widget this gives an options to a customer to go forward and this is completely customized again depending on the user. in recently viewed what we do is we looked at the products seen by that user in that session i could have spent say 10 minutes on your site before actually ran into the zero results page so the products that i have viewed in the last 10 minutes the and any call for actions are performed in those 10 minutes. it could be adding a product to my wishlist reading through product details of that product all those actions are actually captured before these products are actually shown to me so that it's more personal to me that i would actually go back and re-look at these products. and then the top sellers uses the same popularity theme that we spoke about and shows the four products which are most relevant for me so that i could actually click on them and move forward and this is primarily done so that there is some engagement available even if a user accidentally lands on a zero results page. so this is another example i just wanna show uses again more than from a ui perspective so that for a user who is say looking for something or navigating to a specific set of products he doesn't have to be taken into a new browser window.
rep,i'll show you it on a live site as well so us patriot is one of our customer so if you go to their site so what you see more like this the moment i click on this it does not take me to a new browser or a new window it just opens up a small modal window where i am shown all similar products i can choose them and move on. and this is something that we enable by default so that it helps in improving user experience and then the platform works seamlessly on the mobile device as well you don't have to do anything as long as you have a mobile responsive site or an app it works default. this is how the same more like this option also works on your mobile responsive site or your app as well this is how the top-ranked products the top sellers actually appear on the mobile app or the responsive site right. and this is one widget which we've now started building for a lot of our apparel customers and they've seen their are other values actually sometimes double and go even more than that. it's called buy the look in the home furnishing well we call it complete the set you could call it a different name in your space. but the whole intent is this so as a user i am buying a pair of shorts but what the widget is telling me is with this pair of shorts this t-shirt this jacket and the shoe goes well.
rep,so while a user is buying one product you're probably recommending two or three products which are closest to that user so that you dramatically increase the average order value. at manier times a user might actually be looking for that product but he might not have the time to go and find that product or he might think that he or she will probably buy the product next next time got on your site. but you actually capture the user attention right here so this is where actually a collection of algorithms come into play so one we look at is the entire product detail in the content theme itself where we start understanding what is this product that the user is buying and what can be clubbed. and the second thing we also looked at is our entire upsell cross-sell of themes where we look kind of somebody buying product a what is more likely grouped or can be grouped with product a so that we make more sense because you don't want to be showing the wrong set of products when you complete the set. so initially what we do for this especially for this widget we take some inputs from you your team as well so we tied try it out for a few set of categories where you where you say that okay in my analytics i know that somebody buying a will also buy b and c for sure more likely to buy b and c for sure. so we basically custom build it initially but once you have slightly more data from your system and probably after say three months to four months this starts working like a charm and we've seen consistently across all customers are said this is one of the most popular widget from a business standpoint.
rep,so yeah so this is a very high level overview of how our recommendation platform work so any any questions you have from a business prospective.
prospect,okay first we have a house brand and for the house brand what we would probably in many locations want to boost the house brand and we also have what we call mvp brands mvp are okay think of it like this way. we'll often want to recommend our house brand first followed by any of our mvp brands and then if we don't have we don't have a recommendation for the house brand or mvp brands that had dropped down to whatever we have available and whatever best matches right.
rep,okay that logic can easily built that's not our problem so what are you saying is by default always irrespective of whatever category and this is applicable for both search and navigation.
prospect,yeah pretty much i think so.
rep,yeah so so what we basically do is this is how our dashboard looks like so a you can we can build pre-build this logic where either for search or browse for all actions by default always show the in-house brand first then show the mvp band and then show the rest of products.
rep,and for recommendation widget also what we can do is we always show products as groups of four in that what we can do is the first product we show is always the your brand the second product we show is an mvp brand and three four is whatever is we pick up as general metrics.
rep,so we can pre-configure the system accordingly that's not a problem.
prospect,alright so and then the next thing is our parent company has a feature called c switch and save and so what that does is let's say you're looking at pair of gloves its recommendation i think they do this manually. they don't do do it via an algorithm visually they loaded it up in the backend and you're looking at a pair of gloves and their site will show you another pair of gloves it's not an upsell or so for say it's actually a product that cost less but the margin the profit on it is greater. so the idea is for the customer okay here are some gloves but we've got other gloves that could save you money so why don't you buy these other gloves so it's a it's good for the customer but it's also good for the that for the company because um the cheaper gloves actually has a greater profit margin. and so in this case we almost to be able to feed into your widget some attribute called you know profit margin you know and the widget needs to say okay look for a complementary product that costs less but has the highest gross profit.
rep,absolutely so that is exactly what the more like this widget i showed you seen similar products in the us patriots case i showed you it follows the exact same logic if i click on more like this it will basically show me the same products which have a much better margin.
prospect,so when it shows you these products though i want to limit it to really you know a specific product really that it has to cost less but it but it also has to have a higher gross profit.
rep,yeah so in that case we can actually build something for you where instead of here where you see more like this say it called call it an alternate option of cheaper option or however you wanna name it from marketing perspective. when they click on it instead of showing five it is probably just show me one the details we can build overlays where it probably puts in a specific price and then say some how much percent cheaper is it from the actual product you actually see. we can make it more enticing we can name a price and we can have an overlay here which basically says it is 20% cheaper than the product which probably gives an additional reason for the user to buy we can do that as well.
prospect,right but just as long as it does both criteria they can't just be cheaper it's got to be cheaper and have a gross higher profit.
rep,yeah as long as the information is available to us carlos that's not a problem for us to build <>.
prospect,probably that type of widget so we're talking about like a custom widget you'd have to build.
rep,yes that's a custom widget we have to build.
prospect,what would something like that cost.
rep,so what we do is we usually add it to our integration fee so when we have two fees right one is the one-time setup fee and one is the monthly fee our monthly fee won't change. the only thing that will change is the one time that we build that widget for you because after that the monthly fee is primarily serving for the traffic right so this is building it for one time so that will be a part for one time fee it shouldn't be something which is dramatic.
prospect,alright so the next thing is let's jump back to my website so go to the home page or are you are on the home page now okay all right great alright. so when the customer comes to our site they're not not logged in or they're brand-new customers they're looking at this page but if they come back to our site and previously logged in and they have a cookie they actually go to a specific page for their industry. so i'll give you an example if you go back up scroll back up move up okay and click on providers and click on podiatry p o d okay so in my business it's all medical supplies but there are different type of doctors. and so sometimes the recommendations are universal it doesn't matter which doctor type of doctor you are you'll be able to use the same products but sometimes the recommendations really need to be specific to the type of doctor you are.
prospect,so scroll down okay and click on the the yellow one there the auto-injector okay so you know in this example you are a let's say you are a ems an ems technician in other words you drive the ambulance and you come and help the people. the recommendations over on the right hand side would be completely different from what what we're showing right now and so we need to be able to if if the customer's logged in we need to be able to pass to you. what is their type of doctor and your algorithm needs to give us recommendations based upon what other doctors of the same specialty would often buy you know does that make sense so it's what i really know it's like personalization but for segments or for groups based upon if the customer is logged in or something else you know.
rep,yeah that is carlos completely fine because you've enough number of recommendations where we primarily based on new user repeat user and what it is exactly talking is what we do with a specific theme where you're selected this product we know the details of this product and someone picking up this product. you actually show a specific set of recommendations which is similar to that product so that is completely fine we do this by default is is that you'll have to pass on those specific intrinsic values wherein which is the doctor and what is that we have to show so those that inputs will need but we can we can render this by default that's not a problem.
prospect,okay and then the last point is there a way you can give me control over the mouse so i can show it to you quickly.
rep,yeah one second and make you the presenter you should have it with you carlos.
prospect,oh i'm gonna have to download it yeah i don't have time for that actually i have a i have a hard stop soon coming up.
prospect,oh go quickly go back to my site.
rep,okay i'm on your site carlos.
prospect,oh okay you need to share your screen again.
prospect,okay on my site please search for gloves.
prospect,okay so click on downloading it's so click on the first one the more no no down more brand powder free nitrate gloves yeah click on that okay this is on my product detail page. and okay so you're looking at a bunch of gloves and they come in different sizes and so over on the right hand side my core metrics in giving the recommendation and the recommendations are other gloves okay so this makes total sense. you're looking at gloves and we're we're showing you other gloves that's fine so now search for something like a e d a e d  okay. and search for that and click search.
prospect,so click on scroll up a little bit yeah oh okay so click on this thing called philips medical systems.
prospect,yeah that one click on that one so in this case it's a little bit different type of product because of the prior product there's a parent okay and within the parent there are sku and each sku has it's different size. and so no matter what size you're looking at you're still looking at a gloves in this particular product parent it has of course also skus within it but this skus that are in it are a little bit different. like the first two maybe the main unit the second unit second sku maybe an accessory the third sku maybe a battery and you know unlike for example if you went to best buy website and you're looking at a tv on the product detail page you're looking at a tv the recommendations are going to be other tvs or maybe also a cross that like a dvd player right.
prospect,so it's very easy to do a recommendation in that case but some of our products are a little bit more difficult because it's a mixture of different type of type of products within a parent right.
prospect,then the question is you know what are we recommending you know what what is it that we should be putting on that page because you may be recommending the main unit or you may be recommending you know batteries so does that make sense what i kind of getting that.
rep,yeah absolutely so this is the similar example i showed you right so where i was buying the humidifier it showed me the filter along with the humidifier right. so this is where the the entire intelligence comes in as to what has been bought along with that product right when i am buying a health rate defibrillator am i buying an accessory along with it or am i looking at buying something of or i'm trying to buy two defibrillator for me right.
rep,so this is where the intelligence that comes in from the big data system at the back end comes into play where we look at trends on your site while we start recommending products along with it and this is something that we don't have to do manually. if you want to do it manually we can build something manually as well but generally the system starts picking up itself as to what is the right product to be shown an accessory an an accessory or a similar product or a combination of both.
prospect,products that that we display on our website but you can't add it to cart because you actually have to buy it through our sales team on the phone however we still displayed on our website so in that case there's really no sell data on our website so how would we do a recommendation in that case <>.
rep,yeah so it based on add to cart or any action any call to action is basically captured when we actually show the recommendation widget it could be<>. and we can define those call to actions as well so do you want to look at recommendations based on the clicks that the product gets do you want to start doing recommendations with the sales orders that the product actually receives or do you want to do it as a combination of the two. there is something that we can work towards when we initially built out in your cases that are actually too many of such products we can probably give a higher weightage to clicks and a slightly lower voltage to the actual <incident> we can probably say 60-40 <ratio> so we can we can work it out.
rep,and i understand i think with the more and more we're talking i understand in your case we'll probably have to customize things a little more because of the space you are in and specific requirements you have i did see a login section i did see a provider section. and i think a lot of things will change depending on on who i am when i login i'm sure you how my information and then have to start looking at specific so we'd have to customize this to some extent but i think from a back-end the data system itself the system can learn and the way you teach it so that should not be a problem.
prospect,i think that site of the project that's pretty straight forward not difficult <>.
rep,no problem please do and we can also quickly talk about pricing when we connect again.
prospect,yeah the last time we talked about pricing patricia had given your team a server calls in a month and so the price that they quoted was around $14000.
rep,this is the annual cost or is this monthly cost.
prospect,no it was the annual cost.
rep,okay so this is for the search solution or the recommendation itself.
prospect,no just the recommendation.
rep,okay so how much has the calls changed in the last one one year or six months.
prospect,i'd say it's pretty flat.
rep,okay so yeah if there's a price already coated will will definitely stick to that price so i don't think there'll be any change.
prospect,yeah please look into the content in your crm to see if you have any notes on your experience with patricia in those days i'm sure he has some notes that i'll look for as well.
rep,sure absolutely i'll do that and when we talk next i can come back to you with the pricing the only thing that might change is the one-time cost due to the installation fee yeah that depends on the amount of customization you need but apart from that the pricing may remain fairly similar.
prospect,alright yeah great alright thank you so much.
rep,thank you so much for your time sir look forward to connect with you again.
prospect,yeah have a good day.
prospect,i've vacation next week so probably after i get back from vacation.
rep,thank you bye.
prospect,yeah bye.
rep,we are a little bit tight on time and i want to make sure that i do justice to this call so is it a possibility by any chance.
rep,two things are you by any chance visiting eatle west did you check that conference out.
prospect,so yes i did check that conference and like i talked to my boss also so they did decide like it would be good if we can push it to the west or east because right now we haven't got our budget approved for that spot so.
prospect,yeah i can i can come on my own but then like i won't get any news from like approve so that's the biggest challenge but he did mention that we can do it for the later one the one that is going to be in boston.
rep,got it no problem so and where exactly in san francisco are you by any chance.
rep,i can barely hear you can you hear me.
prospect,so i can hear u is that audible now.
rep,okay  oh yeah now it's.
prospect,hello. mm-hmm
rep,yep. mm-hmm
prospect,okay so i yeah so typically i commute to and from from the hercules and we are based out of harchly in each way.
rep,okay i'm just trying to figure out okay so you're in hercules because i am going to be in san fracisco on monday.
prospect,okay. mm-hmm
rep,whatever.
prospect,monday is that 15th.
rep,ya the 15th  yep so give me one second because what i should have done this before you trying to call i'm going to send the tail.
rep,this is where our investors office is right it's not that far it's you're about an hour away and we're if y ou don't mind me asking where you commute from.
rep,from the city from.
rep,city or san francisco.
prospect,yes down down city ya.
rep,oh from san francisco okay because we are staying in san francisco what we can do if you are okay with it is we can meet for like breakfast or something on monday morning okay if it's okay with you before you go into the office we can meet somewhere in the city we can talk about this and if we can show you all the things that we want to show you so we can actually spend some quality time so we can take all the time to answer all your questions and show you exactly what we want to show you as well.
prospect,oh that worked.
rep,usually i'm meaning right after this one but i want to make sure i spend more time with you because we have a lot of things we want to show.
prospect,definitely so okay give me some time i'll see monday like after just the problem is like we are going through a five point cycle ready cycle of new announcement and i have been like doing all kind of uat testing and that's that was my last meeting before this where it got expanded.
prospect,so so we one of.
rep,what about sunday.
prospect,sundays doable hundred percent.
rep,so i land sunday afternoon like 3 or 4 pm so i can do like drinks you can meet for like late coffee or drinks or something like that.
prospect,sure sure sure make sense mm-hmm.
rep,if that works for you then we can do that.
prospect,sure sure sure definitely so sunday evening.
rep,yeah so is this this cell phone that i should call you so think about it.
rep,is nine oh nine two six seven four six eight nine.
rep,okay perfect what i can do is you tell me what time in the evening so anytime after 4:00 pm or 5 pm.
rep,i can do see i think i landed four by the time i get out of the airport rental-car all that stuff you know so 5-5 30 i can.
prospect,where do you stay like exactly in the city or <>
prospect,i'm not sure yet but what i can do is because i'm coming to sfo the airport.
rep,and the airport is pretty was close to the city i can i can meet you somewhere in the city or howard wherever you feel like and and then i can go my merry way to send to san mateo so i'm gonna stay somewhere close to san mateo essentially.
prospect,san mateo okay got it got it.
rep,so you would be commuting back from the city of san mateo during that night right after we meat.
prospect,that that's going to be exactly.
rep,i can come up north or if you're in the area you can come up south whatever is easy for you i know there's a nice little mall right near the airport in this i think it is in i think it's in san mateo but i think it was san i'm trying to remember where we ate last time i rolled it it was a nice little mall with you know some restaurants and stuff.
prospect,okay yeah i am not that familiar but like i am near at&t park which is very well known place like the downtown.
rep,it sound smart yeah.
prospect,so forth street and forth and king street basically so i lived there so which is very would be easier yeah okay.
rep,<> some serious rats <> <> <> .
prospect,i'm sharing a room so i'm not standalone person to basically rent the whole room i'm not even i think the whole room and renting it chill on a shared basis so it's it's expensive but it's worth it.
rep,got it i see.
rep,so i i know i have somebody who lives in marina and when i heard how much they pay per month for rent i was like i am not coming here ever so at&t hard is that far from there it's way close to the financial district chinatown so i think.
prospect,yeah yeah fourth street and king street.
rep,got it yeah good for you.
rep,good for you okay so we can figure that out <> if you give me one day what i can do is sometimes saturday or sunday i can text you on your cell phone let you know we're closer to where you live so now i know you're close to at&t park we can find a place that's close to you and and i'll have a car so it's okay no matter where i go.
prospect,yeah that's good i don't have a car <> <> living in the city and having a car so.
rep,absolutely there's only one thing you can afford ins living is by a at&t park i totally get it i'm surprised i'm surprised you know by a lot of friends who live in marina and i'm like how do you guy what do you eat you know let you fast every day one time fasting or you know how do you guys survive because anyways i'm done with my jokes but i will figure that out we'll find a place close to you you can have been an uber right for you if possible and then we'll go from there is that okay.
prospect,sure yeah that that's pretty doable yeah thank you so much yeah.
rep,yeah absolutely no problem and i so apologize for today i.
rep,to keep about a 30 minutes.
prospect,it it's my mistake so.
prospect,its my mistake suneesh dont worry about it.
rep,this is what happens and i should have prepared myself to give myself half an hour but i did and i had.
rep,okay so thank you for understanding we'll meet on sunday and we'll do this with you and then we'll go for there.
prospect,sure definitely.
rep,i would also.
rep,well thank you thank you.
rep,i really appreciate your understanding talk to you soon.
prospect,soon okay thank you moaning thank you bye.
rep,and you know any changes that you want with respect to the design layout and so on i just want to make sure we've discussed all of that before my team starts the implementation.
rep,lets go with this so you are currently on magenta right.
rep,so we do have a plugin for magento's through which we can directly pull your product catalog as well as integrate our recommendations for switch the best way that we are generally suggests to everyone is to go through the hosted search implementation wherein we can actually host the search page at our end without really touching anything within your magento just to ensure that there are no no conflicts with any of your other third parties and whenever you make changes you don't have to come back to us to actually help with that so what we do is we actually come up with our own search page which looks exactly the same way as your current search page does and except for the fact that it would be hosted at our end and the only thing that changes is that you have to create a sub domain at your end and read out back to unboxd so for the end user it's still gonna be the same lostgolfball dot com but internally the page would actually be hosted at the unboxd so this is so fastest way of implementation and ensure that you know with all the customizations that keep happening in magento this install that none of those get changed the unboxing presentation and in fact even the unboxers are not stopped working just because someone your team goes here that makes in other changes in magento so this is our recommended way for implementation so it's the most an implementation let me just yeah that approach fine for the implementation.
prospect,okay so you would create we would create a sub domain for the categories and you would just host that page on your end is that what you're saying.
rep,yes we will be reading this for search i'm assuming they're just going for the search product right not the category.
rep,yes okay would let it it would be something like this it would be called search of lost golf ball dot com.
rep,and just have your search here just the way you keep having right now.
rep,and then let's see nike doesn't know it's gonna look to the end user.
rep,so that's one okay.
rep,and yeah we would also be providing your recommendation widgets i'm gonna discuss that in the second part of the call the first thing i want to take you through is the order suggest layout so i do see that currently you do show some of the popular products and its not coming so is this some other third-party using for search or.
rep,this is what magento offers right so let me just show you the different layouts we have within our auto suggest now there are a lot of them a lot of other designs besides the ones i show you here i'm gonna send them over to you in an email to you so that you can go through them and then take a call on the kind of order suggest you want but i just want to give you an idea of the different elements we have within this order suggest the first thing here is something we call the guided search what essentially this does is it categorizes your data based on your data this could be brands this could be categories or subcategories and so on so for example if someone starts typing in t-shirts asian my catalog i may actually want to show the different brands that this product was available in or the different categories that this product is available so these are all configurable and as soon as you click on any of them it directly takes you to the page with that particular attribute filtered on already so it just helps in categorizing the data faster and helps in users reaching the right set of data a lot faster than first going to a search page and then the filter and so on so this takes care of that we also have the popular product section now this is something which is popular in real time it takes into account the clicks the active part and the order is happening on your site and based on the query that is being typed in it shows you the most popular products they want.
rep,you may or you may not have an active part or show any of these other attributes within this as well these are all configured.
rep,and then you have the top query section which is essentially the section where in the real-time search queries the popular search queries actually done based on whatever you start typing in so this again keeps getting aggregated and in real-time it keeps changing based on what is being searched on more.
prospect,okay so can you use historical data to do or is it just whatever is current at the moment.
rep,we can use historical data for top queries yes.
rep,so you think that the best practice we already always start by putting the previous top such queries we get from you and then of course once we go online we keep advocating that it ourselves.
rep,and then we have have the keyword suggestions which is again something which is configured completely from the back end where you can define different attributes and how you know the search should actually look like when someone starts searching for something oh this is something for example let's say color plus category or gender plus product type and so on so we've come up with combinations once we've actually seen and analysed the top search queries which we get once you share with us so based on that we come up with these keyword suggestion combinations again if you think we should configure it in a specific way we can go in and do that.
rep,so yeah so this is how these are the different elements within the auto suggest  how you want this this auto suggest can be changed you wanted a the single box order suggest we can do that if you want the two side auto suggest that can be done as well the way use more images and all of that all of these are configurable so i'll share a few of our sample layouts with you let me know you know which ones you like and we can go ahead and implement something similar.
rep,so any questions on this.
prospect,hmm no all good.
rep,alright okay well do you have responsive or a dedicated site that could make an implementation for mobile about faster as well. well do you use google analytics <> check on the reporting numbers and so on.
rep,so one thing that you request from you is getting a read-only access to your ga because again anything one we can pull up on the top search queries and second be kind of gives us an idea of what are people searching for popular products it just helps us with conquering our search.
prospect,okay no problem.
rep,so currently you are using the default magento search all right are you using anything for recommendation currently.
prospect,we are not.
prospect,there's nothing for that.
rep,okay all right  so this is why i take you through how the search page layout should look like so first thing i see of course is the way your suggestion works finely you wanted to be the same layout for patient nation or do you want us to give you an infinite store.
prospect,wholly infinite i mean we don't have that many products the most we have is that i guess 
 its depends on the search we've never seen it but we'll do it.
rep,okay i think they keep the layout pretty similar we'll have four products for each we're not gonna change anything there do you want us to give you both the grid views on the list yeah i think you have both of them so we should give you both as well now as part of search what we also give you is an <> algorithm that automatically takes care of any of the spelling errors that people make on the site the only thing i wanted to check from you is what kind of messaging would you want would you just want to standard if you mean or do you have something specific in mind.
prospect,um i mean the standard did you mean is fine.
rep,okay okay and i do see different slot options here by relevance name and price do you want us to create these slots ports on any other custom attributes as well.
prospect,meaning on any other category pages.
rep,essentially all feel like you know popularity or new arrivals and this comes or anything like that or do you just want to keep the ones you have currently.
prospect,well we searched wise i didn't you know we can just keep like popular products i guess but as far as like any other pages it's we we manually put those that way .
rep,okay and do you currently use any kind of overlays or labels for i i do see it some messaging for out of stok product do you want us to come up with some kind of overlay which says sold out or you know something on the image which kind of says maybe.
prospect,is that something like that already.
prospect,on our regular so if you go to if you got on the left hand side there's a fine actually is that a specials page i think.
prospect,okay so see okay no i lied uh go to see clearance page to clearance page.
rep,that's fine.
prospect,i just wanted to show you maybe if i did't know if it has any issue so we've kind of a little bit of a flag that happens on there is that something you're referring to.
rep,yes something like this yes.
prospect,okay so we've got one already.
rep,so does that yeah.
rep,do you want us to keep the same flags just to make you happy you can show the same on the search page as well.
prospect,um it doesn't have to be but yeah i mean we can.
rep,or if you want if you want we also come up with a new design for these overlays i'm not sure if you would want to do that because you may want to keep the same experience on the category in the search pages.
prospect,mm-hmm yeah.
rep,if you want to get at least come up with the most basic ones saying i'll star or even a great deal for some of them let me know how you want to do that.
rep,yeah which is the basic ones what is the logic which defines the product will be great deal.
prospect,what's the logic to find a great deal there isn't one i don't think.
rep,so is there something in the feed which would let me know what product has been labelled as great deal or something.
prospect,we manually picks up.
rep,oh okay then okay in that case we might not be able to show that what we can do is <> sold out once if there is any attribute to which we can define whether a flag has to be created or not there is no one will create this all.
prospect,yeah it's only it's only if we we actually manually do it.
rep,okay got you so for now i keep out stock itself and do you currently have any kind of variance for each of these products or are they all unique products in themselves don't you be having child products or variants.
prospect,oh i think they're all unique <> <> one for $17 point 99 is out of stock.
rep,okay and layout wise i think we want to keep the same one other information you're showing on your category pages they're not keep the same yes.
rep,all right so that's fine do you have do you want us to kind of have a strict- strike through initial price and you don't have the discount price shown up there.
prospect,ya we can but how would you be able to do that we would have to enter in maybe we'd have to enter than that manually wouldn't we as we change the price manually.
rep,so whenever you change the prices or any of that because you're doing that in magento our system would be able to pick it up all we need to do is find out if the product is on discount and if it's on discount then strike through the original price i'm sure the discounted price.
prospect,no i wouldn't i wouldn't i would just leave leave it like i did as it is right now.
rep,oh yeah got it.
rep,do you want us to demote the out of stock products to the bottom of page.
rep,and since we're gonna provide you an infinite scroll we are going to give you a back to top button we are gonna give you a message saying no more results on the page at the end of infinite scroll okay also just to load your image when someone goes to the infant scroll and besides that for your faceting let me see it currently you don't have any filters or savage.
prospect,ah.
rep,are we can come up with filters there you can have multi select filters and categories on brands and prices or any of the other proper you know attributes that you have.
rep,let me let me know which ones you want us to start with i think categories may be brands.
prospect,yeah yes embrace yeah.
rep,you can start with the <> add anymore you know once we've got the data and so that should be okay <> and for price do you want us to do a normal filter or you can just select different ranges or     would you want us to come up with a price slider.
prospect,um i would do for your range cuz unless our products are pretty much roughly around the same pricing i category wise and your price range yeah.
rep,alright and wanna be reflect scroll you're gonna make sure that the navigation on the left hand side the filters are actually fixed when you keep scrolling so that you can just pull up into wherever you are without having to go to the top of the page.
rep,so what's gonna be fixed and whenever a filter is selected you would also be able to see which of the filters were selected separately just in case you don't remove any of them or go ahead and i believe also then have tax and the fact that do you have any kind of the review system that you're using.
prospect,we we have the standard magenta one and work belt were also on a free trial with another review system that we're about to probably move forward with in the next couple of weeks.
rep,okay because whenever you do that we could display the same information on the listing pages as well.
prospect,oh awesome yeah.
rep,alright and the new addition is going to be pretty similar for the mobile devices as well since it's a responsive site.
rep,so that should be taken care of automatically and the size that let me know if you have any questions on the search otherwise i'll move on to the recommendations.
prospect,oh no touch it so far so good.
rep,okay and just to give you this these are different recommendations that we have i can tell you the ones which we generally recommend to start off with and then you know maybe in the next phases we can go in and implement some of the other widgets.
rep,alright all right so one we always like to start with the recently viewed widget this is something which goes on the home page yeah we.
prospect,ya have one already oh.
rep,so do you want us to provide this or you want to try it some of the other ones i can show you the other once.
prospect,yeah let's look at some other one.
rep,okay so on the product description pages pages we have the more like these so this is essentially showing you some of the other similar items when you'r looking at this product this code on the pdp which is that  recommended for you <>.
prospect,yeah how's that logic recommended for you.
rep,yeah so recommended for you is personalized for every user it depends upon the activities that this user has towards different categories towards different brand and towards different price ranges so based on each one of these we trying that recommended products assumption should be you know like if you are selecting a lot of nike products we want to make sure that they actually show you some of the other products from nike itself and so on so personalized for every user and this goes on my home page.
rep,okay and we also have the top sellers of course this is something which should go on the home page and this essentially this place.
prospect,with all of these how would that look on the home page would that look buttoned or.
rep,so what i can do is i come up with a specific design all these widgets with my designer so that we can kind of give you an idea of how this different layouts would look.
rep,i do see the google recently viewed or that whatever and we give you does not really clutter it too much.
rep,you can come up on based on that.
rep,so that's for top sellers and we have the cart recommendation this is something i suggest we use in phase two this is very powerful if used properly the only thing is for a <> with so for example i have a specific product in my cart i can go ahead and recommend some of the other products i want these users to buy based on a specific category or subcategory which needs to be defined through our dashboard.
rep,so i would suggest people think this once you are a little familiar with our dashboard once you know how this whole thing works and then go ahead and put this on the cart page you want to check out pages.
rep,so this is something i would say definitely phase two.
prospect,i love it that.
rep,we have category top sellers this is again the displaying.
prospect,atributes
rep,on your category pages for example if someone goes to nike you want to make sure you can show some of the most popular products from nike are getting depending on your catalog if your catalog does not have too much data for each of these categories i would suggest may not be using it right now we can get using this in phase two again.
rep,yeah okay these two are interesting so we have a viewed also view and a bought also bought widget both of them go on the product description pages move over they'll need some kind of data aggregated already before they start from the in relevant information i wish didn't have going ahead viewed so viewed it will not appear for the final first five or six days but both that it will start showing data which can actually help you in cross selling some of your products.
rep,random hardness 15 pages.
rep,so i suggest you to start off with these and then we can always go ahead and other widgets so let me know let me know your thoughts on them and another quick update so we have is recommended for you which it this is something we also provide on our no search results found page as well so in case unboxd is not even returned any noodles another for a specific query made on the site we take you to a page which actually at least shows you the recommendations and you know says a message like didn't find any results and you know you may be interested in the following products so this even goes on the no search results page as well.
rep,so yeah these are the different recommendation widgets we have let me know if you have any questions on any of these.
prospect,nope so far so good all right.
rep,so yeah so i guess these are the only questions i had for you let me know there are any other questions on this and this is pretty much the same thing in which we would implement this for the other side that you have unless you have something else in mind and now.
prospect,it should be the same format.
prospect,what access would you need like what path.
rep,well i will share the details with you with you essentially we need access to your magento admin panel as well as an ftp or an ssh access to the server as well.
rep,you can take care of the rest from our end.
rep,yeah so i think you access to the admin but in order for me to be access to the sftp i would need to know what path you would need access to those details.
rep,i will send details over an email to you.
prospect,i mean <===>.
rep,yeah okay so and besides that what we also do in parallel is i would share the autosuggest layouts with you let me know which ones you like and we'll come up with designs for the autosuggest as well as for the recommendation widgets and how will it come at your site.
rep,i didn't pocket him there okay.
rep,all right so yeah i think those are the only things i have to mind let me know if you have anything else.
prospect,and i will review this contract and i will let you know once it gets approved and send it over.
rep,good thank you so much for your time.
rep,please have a good one.
rep,we do the difference with unbxd is that we use machine learning so we've been around for six and a half years but we have taken into account in our algorithms or over the behaviour of buyers and shoppers for over 200 million products . and so we're constantly refining our algorithms to ensure relevancy to optimize product discovery so people find the information that they are wanting and being able to find what it is that they need so a lot of the you know like synonyms stemming did you mean we eliminate a great deal of that because the system because of the machine learning and taking advantage of prior behaviours will automatically provide results for your users it eliminates probably 85 to 95 percent of the manual effort on the part of our users so while while you know.
rep,search tools out there are positive they still require a great deal of manual effort and manual and intervention to be successful harisons joint i am hearing a lot of background noise .
rep,okay so being able to eliminate that manual effort is really important and provides a a huge benefit for our customers the other thing that's really important is to drive conversions you saw over 30 percent earlier and so by do ensuring you're delivering relevant results is where you get that so i go through this this is this is because of the machine look and what unbxd be able to give to you and this is expressed i don't know if you've ever shopped on its press let me go to their actual website so you can go and you can play around with this but here it might start typing our into the search box the system automatically delivers relevant results to the user now if this was a known user someone had already signed in these results would be even more personalised to the user this would be dates on their create prior behaviour right now this is raced on generic but forbes express customers along with all of the prior learning said unbxd offers now the really interesting thing here also is that as you go down you can see how the thumbnail change how again we're trying to make this a much better experience for the user by delivering relevancy the other thing that down at the bottom which is really interesting is and i don't know why right now but for some reason orange dresses modern dresses are have been boosted by the system more people are looking for orange and modern right now so it's actually become a category with that express needing to define it as a category.
rep,because we're trying to offer greater relevancy and personification.
rep,another example is parts warehouse and here purchase ware house parts for a great many consumer products now repairmen can be ordering these parts users can be ordering these parts also because you see the my beer it can be based on things that you have bought before .
rep,but if i start typing in the eye well bissell is the only manufacturer or process parts warehouse carry the way they designed their site and you'll see with unbxd .
rep,we offer you know you can design the sites as you want you see bissell here in the left hand side different products then you see you know different parts i should say on the right hand side you see different this a vacuum cleaner so if you don't know the part number if you recognise your vacuum cleaner you can use that to get down to your part or you can see top searches down below again to provide relevance .
rep,and i think another thing that you will probably find very interesting i think this could be quite relevant to bevmo did that big basket is a grocery supplier if i start typing in red you see a listing of breads this is generic for me because i have not logged in but right now holi is the most in demand of the breads then you see brown .
rep,so it is it is providing relevancy to the user without the user needing to do anything and without the company without big bass basket having to do anything .
rep,this is all through the machine learning now if i had logged in and let's say that i really like garlic bread would have been boosted to the top because wanting to the experience very easy for the user so if ever someone likes a certain type of liquor or a certain type of wine and .
rep,if they've purchased that before wouldn't this make it much easier for them to add items to the cart and then just you know hit delivery ship it delivery and all that and you know have it be a much easier experience for them.
prospect,add to cart that's something that you need to big basket is not coming from your solution.
rep,no that's so the way we work that's a great question we would sit right on top of her beside magento we don't replace magent so you will continue to use the magento shopping cart we take over the whole search and customer experience function that that try and everything that .
rep,i'm talking about that will boost certain categories very certain categories see the type that do the spellcheck do the synonyms the automatic error correction things like that that's that's what we've you to be able to enhance the product discovery you want to make it very easy for people to find a product and here isn't here now again this was a choice for big basket.
rep,they wanted this drop-down to be there to make it very easy for the user uh-huh make sense. yes .so many both back to there yeah so i've got that yep another thing that's really really difficult is spell check so we've talked about to me about having to do that manually which is a very onerous task very labor-intensive and quite frankly it's a test that never ends because people are always find any different ways there are different ways that you need to correct .
rep,take advantage of the unbxd machine learning solution and what's unique you know it's not only the machine learning aspect of it but we can auto correction multiple misspelled words so seriously black leather jackets all three words are misspelled and we can auto correct all three words and deliver relevant results so we're not we're not calling out users for misspellings or you know synonyms things of that sort where we're trying to anticipate what the users want and delivering relevant results.
rep,the only thing that's really really important and you know what some of the approxi can really see this but the people are looking for italian barolo or let's say they're looking for .
rep,a it could be a french red sensor or a french white since they're every other search engine uses the a methodology called tf-idf which is turn frequency and in frequency so he tries to give relevancy so it's either the the most frequent turns that our founders most infrequent and their combined to deliver resultsbut that's that's incorrect and it doesn't provide any context any contextual relevance to a search effort are you familiar with tf idf
prospect,no that's something i've never heard until you just said it
rep,okay it's not a good system but it's the best that's there and was really developed much more on document search for productive search so if i have a look at this example brown leather belt.
rep,. it's going to number one interpret this as in which is wrong first and try to look at all of the solutions that are around it looks at leather so it will look at all of the brown solutions that are also of leather and the last thing that will check itself it's completely wrong and it's not relevant for the users what we do our solution again this is automatic for the machine learning aspect is that we understand.
rep,hello hello hello this is a pranav here i think we just lost on the line.
prospect,i think so too.
rep,no all right just give me a moment.
rep,okay hey pranav i'm checking with louswell trying to make sure that we can hear him.
rep,all right all right thanks sunil.
rep,sorry kristen for some reason his call just got dropped so he's dialling back in.
prospect,that's okay.
rep,you you hello christi.
prospect,hi.
rep,i am sorry my i'm on a mobile phone and it just dropped i totally apologise so i had to go through the whole process of dialling back again how much did you hear what i was talking about with relevancy.
prospect,well you asked me if i knew of a term that you had just mentioned that was kind of where i lost you.
prospect,it's the best we've got today<>.
rep,yeah so what we do is we do two things through the machine learning we order we offer another criteria to ensure relevancy of results we do contextual relevance .
rep,but also as part of that and this is this example with brown leather belt and tf-idf we'll look at brown leather belt and we'll look at brown first and looked at for all the results that are brown .
rep,so i was trying to put it in terms of wine so sense era there you could say french red sense era or french white sense era .
rep,so first who would look for french then it would look for the colour red or white and the last thing would look at would be since there we don't know if it's going to come back with good results because the first thing it's looking for our is french i'll fill it for all the french then the red the last thing is sans-serif and that greatly limits the results.
rep,it does not deliver relevancy what we do and because of the machine learning and how we help the results is we look at brown leather belt or french red sense era our salute automatically knows that since air is the parent we know that french is a nationality attribute we know that red is a color attribute or a type of varietal attribute so we start with the current and then look at the attributes to deliver our results it offers a much better user experience.
prospect,so it doesn't necessarily matter orders what you're saying.
rep,it does not matter what order so that we're not forcing users to enter information in to the search box in any order or it's completely independent of the order that they enter items into the search box.
rep,they get the same result what we found is that conversion based on search you know site search versus just regular search versus navigation is usually two to five times greater than going after you going via attribute and so we really want to optimise the search box as much as possible but we gear up the entire user experience on the site this site showing really there's 12 different query types .
rep,that we feel are there and that we address not every of our customers uses all 12 of these but we want to make all 12 available as part of the solution and these are out of the box so whether it be an exact search site non practice may be people are looking for what are your shipping method you'd be amazed at the number of sites but if someone puts shipping method in the search box no results found as well you need to be able to address all of the needs of that user no matter whether they're very specific or related to your products or not does that make sense.
prospect,um yes i'm curious what symptom is what is that.
rep,so so symptom i see if you are if you're looking for something cold hot symptomatic where it actually is a qualifier for the the item that they are looking for.
rep,so it's a it's a qualifier attribute.
prospect,so it could it be treated similarly then to something like natural language.
rep,every yes natural language we want to ensure that natural language is there but that also they take advantage of slang slogans things of that sort so that's where the linguistic shortcuts is there also or the implicit implied we don't want to have to force users to enter information in a specific manner or with specific nomenclature .
rep,if they're not familiar with that some will we get this for specialist on in our b2b environments where especially where you find people who have worked in a in an industry vertical or let's say part supply whatever they know the parts numbers they know all of the acronyms are similarity everybody.
rep,i'm sorry the qualifiers there well someone knew that might be starting at the company won't have any idea of a big though the natural language.
rep,do all 12 of these is really really difficult the other thing that's that's very important christian is to be able to do all those merchandising upsell cross-sell things that you had today with magento.
rep,but to unable the system to do it automatically for you based on machine learning where have you been a where have you been able to achieve the greatest results how can you increase the shopping cart the largest and let the machine do that automatically for you defining category pages you know different promotions new arrivals things of that sort with system automatic boosting.
rep,system where different categories will be boosted or attributes are in categories you know you can define whether you want that done based on margin things of that sort but let's say you want to override that you have a slow seller and so you you know you can either let the system automatically be trained to both lose items where you have greater inventory or provide intervention to boost certain categories or be different promotions as you see fit you can also have seasonal the.
prospect,now do you have any examples of where you might be able to put some sort of marketing creative a marketing banner within a search result if you want to boost there you have a motion going on and you still don't want to necessarily mess with the search result so you definitely want to have some sort of marketed back promotion if it's relevant to that first term.
rep,yes we have a workbench where you can you know to find banners things of that sort absolutely and very easily also so yes that's part of the solution we also have a great deal of analytic capability that's out of the box are you using google analytics or something like that now.
rep,ya .
rep,know are you using google ga .
prospect,we are we are our current search solution though has have their own reporting as well.
rep,okay our analytics tool is very very strong down to the actual product level and so it allows you to very quickly ascertain what's showing what's not showing different categories you also have the ability to you know obviously you are at the store level you can track at the store level you can track regionally.
rep,mm-hm.
rep,and so it takes you it not only helps us as far as training our algorithms you know when you become a new customer we don't know bevmos business and.
rep,we don't pretend to know that most business but when you deploy unbxd the system starts learning and refining the algorithm specifically for bevmo know if there's some things that we have not seen or that you think can be done differently and you see that through the analytics you can let us know that and you know manually traditional algorithm also.
rep,and what about training learning any sort of since you have machine learning is there the capabilities can build any sort of thematic pages that helps index for natural search.
rep,when you see where you turn that multilingual or what website what you.
prospect,well so say something like red wine and we've got a subcategory of the red wine yeah but for instance i don't necessarily merchandise i don't merchandise to <> say that from an seo perspective. and your machine understands that we should have some sort of a red wine landing page that could be accessed through google search and your solutions build any pages that aren't necessarily you know customer facing except they are callable searchable and they can be landing pages and from google or bing or whatever search engine.
rep,right so to boost your seo the addressee results we we have the ability to do that i don't want to say that we are an seo solution.
rep,so christi i can answer that question little bit more detail so christi what's you're asking is let's say customers are the question is customers are searching for red wine or let's say a specific kind of red wine from a specific region for example and that seems to be happening a lot so you want to make sure that while customers are searching on your site they must also be searching for the same thing google and you want to make sure that the benefit of that search you create this landing page that google can involve is that get the problem skipping correct.
prospect,i say it again.
rep,sure so let's say i'm searching for a malbec wine or something like that or malbec  and you realise that that's a search query that's happening a lot more over time right from the analytics now that you actually realise malbec are being searched a lot so today you don't have a dedicated malbec page what you want to create is now a landing page that shows all the malbec and you want google to index it for your seo the seo benefit.
rep,got it so there's two components to this right one is to actually create a landing page we have the capability to create the landing page the question is when google wants to crawl your site .
rep,it needs to understand to actually crawl that page so somehow it needs to get to that page either you reading it's not i mean somewhere in your sitemap and your footer somewhere when it's crawling your site it has access to this particular page right and then the url is .
rep,somewhat seo friendly url in terms of you know that it's a page for malbecs for example that the other two components is something that we work with your team.
rep,because you guys control the urls not us and you guys control in terms of what the sitemap and the positioning through the taxonomy or anything like that but we enable you to be able to create those pages and the way you might integrate once it's integrated you can create multitude of these landing pages if you want it to as well.
rep,okay i think the the maybe the different question i have is i don't necessarily want to have any manual intervention of having a populate pages i don't want to have to put here i want it to just know what it should build and include it on the page.
rep,correct that's exactly what i'm saying that you're absolutely right so one is the system knows from an analytic standpoint that this is these are the pages where they need to create this would be the kinds of urls that we should create that are seo-friendly and then this is how from a sitemap perspective that .
rep,google should be able to access these pages when it's crawling your website so while we create will we create the landing pages automatically.
rep,what i'm saying is that we have to work with your team to be able to figure out how google can access those pages through the taxonomy or the sitemap and what should that seo friendly url should look like because you guys control the url so as the urls can be dynamic.
rep,that make sense
rep,exactly when the urls become dynamic whenever the customer you can create those dinette whirls the landing pages will get generated automatically and will start to respond with the right set of content or products on that page it's just that it's not completing them it's a part of the customisation and integration that work with you that's all the system enables you to do that.
rep,hopefully i answered your question christin.
prospect,you did you did of course
rep,so its a one time set up to be able to do.
rep,by the way that's monel patel christin he's our svp of customer success he ensures that the ongoing satisfaction of all of our customers should have introduced him but yeah he joined after we had started.
rep,sorry i was late i appreciate that
rep,thank you. so the other thing just - you only talk about best practices but the other aspect of our solution is product recommendations you know all i've mentioned category pages but we also it's not only doing conversions that we are focused and passionate about but it's also being able to drive the size of your shopping cart.
rep,product recommendations cross sell up sell you know what to other people what have they been buying you know so here we talk about wisdom of the crowd or you know completing completing the look or you know people that bought bought champagne often bought whatever you know it could be other you know liquid drinks.
rep,it could be other products it doesn't matter but you also want to be promoting relevant products to the users again this is all done via as a machine learning not through manual and manual intervention if you want to do specifics you can do that but you know the machine will do 85 or 90 percent 90 percent for you.
rep,we also want to share this so here deborah lippmann's i think so you know right now someone has put nail polish into their shopping cart here's an example where you may also love them you see the different lipsticks or another colour of nail polish and this is based on what other people have purchased we want to show relevant results to increase the size of the shopping cart.
prospect,sorry you may also like that that's powered by you <>
rep,yeah yeah absolutely.
rep,yeah and again it's based you know on prior behaviour where we have seen success before so we're automatically speeding this up to the user to not only increase conversion but of course to increase the shopping cart size.
prospect,and what all the solution you have creted on related item.
rep,overall again we've been seeing conversion of 30 plus percent on average with our users so i'm not sure the specific monal you know the specific on the related items and we can track that.
rep,monal i think you are in. monal i don't i don't know the answer i can get back to you on that.
rep,so just a little bit more on our solution i know we had scheduled an hour christen we're a sas solution we sit right next to magento we have many magento customers you don't have to do any ripper replace we go in and for six weeks full production again we're sas so in our sla we guarantee response time less than 300 milliseconds .
rep,usually it's around 150 milliseconds we guarantee uptime remedies are in the contract it if there's you know if we don't meet the sla so there's no arguments there what we strongly recommend for our users and this is demonstrative our confidence in the solution is that do a poc it's a no risk poc we do ask that you pay for the implementation about twenty thousand dollars give or take we would you know get to that .
rep,but around that range to do implementation four to six weeks then you run a poc so let's say you have six to eight weeks if for whatever reason you're not happy and we will guarantee a conversion rate by the way at the beginning of the poc if we don't meet that conversion rate or for whatever reason if you're not happy you can walk away from the poc and we will refund the implementation dollars so it's fully no risk.
prospect,mm-hmm and one thing i'm when you were showing me some of your i think it was expressed that kind of got me thinking about this but in terms of the navigation and i mean do you do you own everything on the page including the left nav in the top nav so it would take over
rep,yeah it depends on on the type of implementation that you want to do most of our customers want us to do an ajax implementation which is very easy much more transparent so you will continue to own the header in the footer and we will own everything in between so all the search results are between it makes it very easy for you.
rep,we just you simply redirect the search you know which we we take over search the other alternatives we can do go with restful api but that's going to take more work on your side it gives you guys a little more control but again it's more of an effort so especially most of our customers want to start off with the ajax approach and you know yeah on the road if they do want to do more they might end up migrating to the restful api is but there's no requirement to do that.
rep,hey luke i'm sorry i just wanted to add to what you just said if you guys can hear me yeah.
rep,now okay okay got it so kristin i think there were two parts to the question that you asked and i think the first part how we integrate the second part of the question is what elements so when you look at and i think your question was specifically on the category pages correct or onj navigation necessary search is that correct and.
rep,no specifically on search page
rep,okay got it so in the search a piece what louk said you know the header and the footer so everything from search results to sorting through pagination filters on the left side any kind of product blocks everything all of that component can be controlled by unbxd. it still looks and feels exactly like what it is today for you but it can be controlled by unbox through the front end method if you do it from the back end give you the elements to render that content but you have total control of whether you want to show it or not to it and how you want to show it.
rep,i just want to add that point thank you. chisty what other questions might you have.
prospect,none at the moment actually have you ever integrated within a native iphone or android app .
rep,correct we have we have iphone and android sdks so yes in short answer is yes.
rep,do you guys have a christian a responsive site or in adaptive mobile site.
prospect,it's responsive well but so we've got that we've got a mobile site which is responsive and then we have a mobile app that we built for iphone and then for android.
rep,okay yep so yeah so for your mobile website because it's responsive it pretty much works the same way whether you do ajax or restful api for your iphone and android apps you have sdks for those apps that your tech team can integrate with.
prospect,okay okay okay no i i don't have any other question right now.
rep,kristin we would love to do a kiosk we look for.
rep,um you know i think the the next step if you don't mind is just just send me the doc that you walk me through and so i can just kind of digest it some more and then we can kind of get back to you and see what a follow up would be from there.
rep,yeah exactly i i think but when you actually see the tool in action on your site and i don't mean this to sound cocky but its confidence i guess would be the best way to put it we did 67 poc last year all 67 people signed up.
rep,because they were blown away with the results you know growth of unboxes again that's not meant to be the least bit i don't want that should be misinterpret i just think it's indicative of how people once they see the benefits say yes this is something we really we really need to have so i will send you the doc when should i you know get back to or start pinging yeah.
prospect,i'm giving it a week and then it can committee gets earlier.
rep,fabulous the other thing just to finish up our licensing or a subscription model is very easy you simply sign up for as a number of site sessions that you have and and.
rep,if you go over the number of site sessions that you have subscribed to there's an overage charge again very clearly detailed everything is very objective there's no hitting anything and so we look for long term relationships and we're very proud of customers that we have.
prospect,great that's good to know too.
rep,okay i will get this to you and i'll follow up in a week but i really appreciate your time thank you very much i the questions were great.
prospect,mm-hmm great and sounds good and we will talk in a little bit.
rep,thanks. bye now.
prospect,pretty hectic like we we are doing some software development lifecycle we have part of 5.2  years
prospect,as i told you earlier so it's been good learning new things yeah.
rep,got it okay all right so we also have with us nimesh the ridhima she's our integration and customer success guru.
rep,and so based on our conversation on sunday what we wanted to cover today is the is to give you an idea of what we need from you.
rep,to make the implementation.
rep,so how do we get the catalog data all the different types of data that you have not just the product but also the documents and stuff like that so what we need then analytics what needs to be deployed how do we deploy it normally so those are the two things and then i the based on that if we can have a conversation with your engineering team or somebody to try to understand how difficult or not difficult this is at least you get an idea of what it is and again then we can come up with this complete plan walk you through the complete plan and then we can go present to your global svp or global vp of e-commerce.
rep,and and then you can take it from there essentially hopefully and then does that make sense that's that sort of the plan that we talked about on sunday .
rep,all right so i want to have that they must start what we need and then from from that perspective how does this search actually gets integrated whether we do think we do it the on-premise hosted or or the backend integration which a program each egg will worry about that we can we can come up with some options on that give you some idea and then if you can get us some feedback from your engineering team on what that looks like that was a good idea to put together a plan and then we can walk in through that.
prospect,oh yeah sure.
rep,okay perfect.
rep,ridhima are you there.
rep,yeah mon i just join hi nimesh.
prospect,okay hai ridhima.
rep,hi mohn can you just make me the presenter i'll just quickly walk nimish through some of the standard steps and then we will take it.
rep,okay let's see trying to make it a presenter but for some reason it's not working let me make you the organizer there you go.
rep,okay there we go.
rep,alright nimesh can you see the screen now.
prospect,yes i can see.
rep,okay so uh there are as mona was saying two three ways of doing this implementation maybe we'll get to that later but let me just talk about some of the initial things that you'd need you know to figure out some of the other elements before we start the implementation so the first thing i guess the most important piece would be how do we go about carrying a product catalogue from you is there a standardized product catalog file that we can already use or can there be an api that can be exposed to us or should be we be pulling this data directly from some database at your end so i just wanted to understand how you do this currently and are you sharing this data with some of the other third parties is that something that we could also use on the unboxd end .
prospect,right right right right so currently we don't share it with third party and we have our own database like our own content management system from where these catalog information including the catalog number title the keywords and everything is being pulled so this is most probably will be an api expose or something related to cms bundle.
rep,right right right okay and a how many prod would be there in your catalog right now.
prospect,so like as i had conversation with mohel and pasanth like it was it was like around 40000 skews and then we have literature that is also part of our search which is also of the same magnitude like 40000 to 50000.
rep,okay okay so when you when you want search you want to make sure that both the contents are made such a good product as well as literature .
prospect,yes yes and there might be couple of other types of content which i was not able to mention in our earlier conversation like for example we do have news and events then we have software's that that could be downloaded from the website so there are there are mixed type of content types not just the skus that we host but also we have product pages then we have category pages then we have a couple of modern versions of category pages so all are actually part of cms and they are like you can say that they are bc are like database content record so these are of different types not just skus we somebody searches on they are not searching just for ask you this also searching for information that they need so .
rep,okay so and you think that you will be able to expose an api which from which we can go ahead and put on all these products.
prospect,yes i should talk to my it team like actually what will be the exact method i don't know as of now i don't know yeah.
rep,and just so you know how you get if i'm pretty sure exposing the api could be one way and otherwise we can also provide you ftp server details and if it's easier for your team to just put the catalog then unboxd can you do automated system to just keep you know pulling in the catalog from that ftp server itself so that's another way.
prospect,yeah so could be good if you can share with this document after the call so that i can go and talk to whitey and see which other ways possible so i can definitely yeah definitely talk to them and get back with all the questions answered.
rep,okay sure i'll go and just so you know we accept all xml json csv anything that you will send to us will anyways been converting unboxd readable format so.
prospect,yes most probably it will be xml yeah .
rep,okay all right so i will share these details with you for the feed and on the field again so then you'll be sending this catalogue to us i mean i want to make sure that we get as much data as possible to make sure the search works well so anything about the category structure or that a product belongs to i'm not sure if all that is stored in one table that you are in but we may  may be different sources on .
rep,right right but you want to make sure that anything which can be used to make the search better and obviously also any of the attributes that need to be displayed on to the search page should also be.
rep,coming to system so so.
rep,so that's one and anything else about the product catalogue that we should be knowing so as you said you know you have products and then you also have the literature is there anything else we should know about the catalogue.
prospect,so like there are a couple of other types of pages like for example gene pages and then the assay pages and we have policies then we have supporting documents apart from literature that are also part of i think the indexed xml's oh so i what i'll do is like i will send you the all the types of bc are basically.
prospect,and also maybe one line like maybe one line description about that.
rep,sure okay and so there will be a way for us or probably a field thatas tell us if this is a proper earlier okay.
prospect,right right there will be then they'll be field associated with that abc are saying this is a particular content type.
rep,gotcha watch it okay fine and another question this may not be off absolute relevance here but i just anyways just want to make sure so when you show products to the users let's say the user logs into your site you know they've signed up to your site and they log in with the their own username and then just in the prices for the users were logged in on the side.
prospect,yes yes yes so there are there are changes and pricing for non user versus a user which might have and there there's a lot of complication around that i don't know how we can tackle that but like to keep things simple like i would say let's just keep non-users as of now because there are different types of pricing because this is a very regulated market so they have different kinds of pricing structures for every customer which makes things more complicated so.
rep,right so basically every user on the site could have a different price being regardless.
prospect,exactly yeah .
prospect,okay and that is being by another database.
prospect,which is all of ap right so.
prospect,i sap pulls these pricing based on the user and and basically yeah so that's how the e-commerce is like we have different databases and everything is getting pulled from different sources of databases.
rep,got you what you so this is something which yeah we have to figure out on how this works but then i talked about the approach of search implementation i will talk a bit more about how this could be implemented so i tell you that in a bit okay so that's one anything else on the catalogue side so the prices can be read for every user is there anything else alright that's fine if there's anything else.
prospect,oh yeah yeah right right right oh fine.
rep,so i'm moving to the next piece so the next piece is about unbox analytics integration so this is something which will have to be done by your team because as i understand from model this is a custom platform that you are using on your end so now so these steps are very similar to how you must have i'm assuming you must have done a google analytics tracking on your site or maybe one of the other .
prospect,right right right right we have web trends.
rep,okay so this is very similar to them when you're just you know placing our div or li tags to actually go ahead and capture search hits on the side the product clicks the active carson orders so these are all the event rack and unbox we'll be using so it's pretty similar to any other standard tracking systems then we'll be providing to a <> that needs to go on to all the pages of the site and then there will be these specific actions where you need to add our code for the you know on the div tags so that you can actually start tracking these events so that's one piece that will have to be done by your team as part of the analytics integration .
rep,so this is on the feed and the analytics integration apart from this just so you know you know whenever we are walking on this they'll also be requiring a history of your top search queries just so you know it helps us in determining how our search is going to work some of the search configurations and so on but that's for latest yet you know once you have the catalogue with us just so you know that those could be some of the details that you require during the course of this project just so we have all information to find you in the search relevancy now the next piece that i want to discuss is the approaches of implementation because after we the catalog we have the analytics integrated it's just about you know who will be doing this implementation will it be something back-end being done by your team or it will it be something done yes so in couple of ways in which you know most of the effort is on the unboxed end is by either following a hosted search approach where in the search which is actually hosted on the unbox servers and you are doing a redirect to a sub-domain which internally is being in fact redirected onto the unbox levels so one way could be that but this way the page is posted on our end the implementing is fast the results load a lot faster so all of that is taken care of inherently because it's a hosted search approach and most of the m-word is required on our end and the only changes you have to do on your end would be you know adding an auto suggest script the javascript that will give you and you know changing the form submit action on the search bar so that it redirects to this specific sub domain which is internally having a cname entry for the unboxed hosted page.
rep,so that's one approach however there could be concerns with this approach specifically if you are looking for you know having that whole pricing structure being different off at any user logging onto the site now that will tell now that you've told me about it this may not be the very the best way of going with this so my ended way would be going with the ajax implementation this is the in page ajax implementation wherein we will provide you a java script from our end that will just replace the you know results div within the search page only the listing part where you're listening for the products that div will actually show results coming in from the unbox id so we will only be replacing that one the header and footer everything at your end so it's just that you are placing our javascript directly on your head so we will give the javascript your team implement set and everything you know works inherently on your site itself now what advantage of this pieces again a lot of implementation work will still happen on our end just like how it's on the bullshit page because we are will be providing you that and this will also take care now i'm sure that there will be can figure out a way in which the pricing can be different for every user i am sure you are currently doing it in a specific way at your end maybe we could use the same scripts the same javascript on these pages also to ensure that in real time the price is changing for these users based on whether he or she is locked in or not so this is how we've done for some of our other clients and that's where i'm coming from.
prospect,hmmm.
rep,so this could be one way of doing the implementation and as i said most of the work will be done the unbxd but obviously will meet your team's help in making sure that you know the right divs are replaced and the whole pricing pieces taken care of by you know taking the right java scripts and their end so this is obviously the third way is you know going ahead with a back-end implementation where your team goes ahead and calls our api's directly for the search the auto suggest the filters and the sorts and we provide complete consultation to your team while they do this implementation.
rep,right so these are the three ways of implementation i'll share this document with you but any specific questions or anything or any approach that you would rather go for anything you just.
prospect,yeah i think approach b or c i think like i have to talk to my it team like i don't know okay of course like as i said there are pricing one being the complete pricing being one issue there there is issue regarding like information and all like being served on the platform and then there might be issues regarding regulation and all i don't know like what are the policies around that so has to see what exactly would be done for so yeah i cannot give you a direct concrete answer right now but yeah i'll definitely have conversation with it and see what what could be the best possible alternative.
rep,okay short so that's fine so i will share these details with you so that you can go back and discuss with the team and of course if you have got more question let us know based on that .
prospect,sure definitely .
rep,so besides i don't want to really get into details of anything else but just to give you an idea of you know men will be implementing search these features that you see here are the ones that will get implemented i'm sure more like jean have talked to you at length about all of these features already so i'm not gonna get into this but that's mostly about it and this document that i'll share with you also has some of the you know deeper details on how the implementation is done whether it's on your end.
rep,or our end into the details right now but i will share this information with you anyways.
prospect,yeah that would be good like if you can share me with these details that's could be good.
rep,i'll do that.
rep,alright so yeah so these were the only questions from my end let me know if there is anything else you want to know from us so that you can discuss it better with your team.
prospect,so oh oh like if i don't know it's more or less there so we had discussion around yeah hey so we have discussions around how do i then right.
rep,correct so the idea what we wanted to do nimish around this was let's if you don't mind understand the complexity of the technology piece because that will influence some of the pricing because remember if we gave you a range and depending on how the solution has to be implemented that price could be on the lower end of the range of the high end ranged number one number two is we also need to understand some of the specific numbers so for example one of the numbers that we need is three numbers that we need is the visits that you get on your side that's monthly basis.
rep,what's your conversion number is and what's your average vote of value is.
rep,okay right yeah.
prospect,i can get.
rep,right and in case you in case somebody internally doesn't agree to provide these without an nda go ahead and send us your nda we'll get it executed from our end and so that you can collect these numbers so if any point you feel uncomfortable or somebody feels uncomfortable sharing any numbers or any information go ahead and let's let's just go ahead and execute an nda because what are the other things well we do i was covering this i thought of was maybe what we should do is get a small sample of your catalog and you're both your product catalog and your literature catalog so we get an idea of what structure that data comes in so that also gives us a good idea when it comes in xml csv we what are the components what parts do we have what we can do what we cannot do we also can start evaluating that piece.
rep,does that make.
prospect,okay okay that's make seance toatally totally.
rep,perfect so we can put all of this in an email so the ridhima if you can share that document with abhishek and i'll also share some of this pieces nimish with abhishake and obviously will send you an email so you have everything in one email and i don't care putting a lot of onus on you but i think that as we talked about this we've done this enough times to know that if you do it this way it has the best chance of success because once you figure out all the answers to any question that you can anticipate from from your boss then i think we'll be ready with all the right answers.
prospect,correct correct correct all right.
rep,does that answers question nimesh.
prospect,yeah so totally make sense and definitely moving ahead like i'll be involving or talking to it team as well as taking this conversation to my boss and see if like how we can go about sharing the information that you need from our site will not require nda or anything of that sort so i'm not aware but hopefully there'll be something i am sure but yeah i'll definitely reply you back on that email.
rep,got it perfect so be awesome and so ridhimare we covered the catalog the analytics and the three approaches correct .
rep,so do we have questions for an nimesh on the autonomy piece on anything that we want to know about before before we let him go.
rep,oh no not at this point of time and of course if i have any questions i will drop in an email and <>
rep,anyways should we answer or do we walk you through enough of this document so that.
rep,you have here all the you have what you need and again if you go to the document again if your questions after you talk to it don't hesitate to reach out email or call and we'll be more than happy to to get you the answer.
rep,they work for you okay .
rep,so what in terms of time frame nimish any anything we can pick as a time for him to check back in with you before it feels like we're bothering you .
rep,no no so at mayon currently we are like as i said we are doing some announcements and like will be done with the testing and implementation in production and we would be ending this current project that i'm working on blake around mid of march or end of march something somewhere around that q1 and so i'll be involving ip sooner before and so that we can have conversation parallel conversations and also i have to reach out to my boss and all the stuff that you have provided me so far with the email that you will send about the requirements then i can talk to him about everything so.
rep,me sometime .
rep,yeah yeah what we'll do is we'll skip next week we'll just try to send it and check in with you the following week to see if if you have any questions if not then we'll try to reach out again in the middle of march so that sound fair .
prospect,yes yeah that sounds good and by that time i'll have some information from both ends for it as well as from the management and then like i'll reply you back on the email with the requirements like how we can proceed and then maybe by the end of march we will have the next steps so we can have one called in between if you need anything to answer your questions or answer my questions and then we can proceed.
rep,perfect that sounds fantastic well awesome nimish again any questions please don't hesitate ridhima any questions right now.
rep,no mohan i think i have all the answers.
rep,abhishek do you need anything .
rep,nothing im done.
rep,awesome all right thank you so much again for your time today so quickly and really appreciate all your help.
prospect,yeah same here thank you mona and thank you ridhima all for sharing all the insight yeah okay.
rep,thanks guys.
rep,so for magento i always prefer the hosted way reason being a lot of times what's gonna happen is you put in the unbox plug-in and we will ensure that there are no third party conflicts once unboxd goes in but then you may line up going ahead and putting in some other plugins and then you always have to come back to us because maybe those guys aren't really able to fix them and then you come back to us and then you know there are a lot of times where you are dependent just because you added a new plugin in magento and i'm sure in magento one lines of doing that quite often.
prospect,ye.
rep,so in case of magento i always suggest posted to be the best way you know opening it it's a faster way of implementation if for some reason you feel later on that you know this doesn't work well we can always go in for a backing implementation but i'm sure it's a good start once we go ahead with the hosted
prospect,and the hosted solution with the sub domain and the hosted that's a quicker implementation from your end as well.
rep,yes it's a quicker implementation from our end that's because my team doesn't have to spend time and trying to you know resolve any third-party conflicts with some of the other plugins that you may have it's a lot of.
prospect,you have already have issues as the results of customisation that are already gotten a bit out of hand so anything i can do to sort of limit additional conflicts or you know overwrites from the magento site would be good and i guess i'm willing to try the subdomain as the first effort provided you know the customers really don't see any impact there that it wouldn't affect our you know seo or search is at all i mean meaning you know what google is seeing but other than that it i mean it seems like a reasonable way to do it i guess you still have to install a connector of some sort.
rep,yeah that's something that's simply going that's a pretty easy thing to just get it up and running in a few hours and then get the feed out and just put it on analytics code but besides that i'll be will be going at it with a question .
prospect,okay well i guess we should probably you know ellis i'm pretty comfortable just starting with the hosted is our first way to try it .
rep,yeah all right so i'm okay so the first thing that we implement as part of the search solution is the auto  suggests when a user starts typing in something i'm not sure you have any others just give you an idea a few different design layouts that we have auto  suggests let me just okay so i am also gonna be sending in a few different autosuggest layouts in an email to you but i just want to kind of explain the different elements that we have in this autosuggest so if you see this first autosuggest so this is a two-sided autosuggest what we have here is one we have something we call the guided search then we are categorizing the data that user is typing in based on categories bronks subcategories or anything else which defines these products a lot better for you based on your product catalog so it just lets the user jump into the right category of data directly from the autosuggest itself so when you in this case it's an apparel example it could be based on categories where someone says t-shirts and the parallels and men's t-shirts top pairs or could be something like a brand or a manufacturer way of saying t-shirts you my and nike and so on and when someone goes ahead and clicks on any of these they are directly taken to filter page where this brand is already pre-selected so this helped and guided search then we have something we call the popular products which is essentially taking into consideration popular products for that specific query so this keeps changing in real time based on the data and then we have a top query section which again takes into account the real time talk queries coming in on the side so these are the actual search queries been made by the users so this is data coming in directly from there and then we have the keyword suggestions this is something can be controlled from the backend you can define whether you want a combination of let's say color plus category or gender plus subcategory or you know anything of those just coming up with the right combinations based on the search queries that we've seen coming onto your site in the back so based on that data we actually come up with these contributions.
rep,these are the different elements within the autosuggest lot of different ways in which they can be done you can have a single box autosuggest where you hook the guided search then you put the keyword suggestions and the popular products or you do it the other way so lot of different ways of doing it i will send in a few layouts so that you can you know just have a look at it but let me know your first thoughts on these.
prospect,okay and there was one there was a company that specialized in in parts really i don't remember if it was parts dot com but he didn't generally some vacuum parts on that we really like the way with respect to parts and those kinds of things that that was working i think that was a nice a nice layout for sure<>.
rep,you want to have something like this but you have a two-sided autosuggest.
prospect,yeah that was impressive to us because basically it's very clean and simple and it was sort of in mind with our article because i mean we're kind of in this space but the pulls up a bit.
rep,hmm gotcha.
prospect,that getting quick you didn't have to get stuck there but i thought that was nice too so.
rep,yeah and i haven still share you the other designs with you so that you can just go through it a quick question on the back parts to the parts warehouse autosuggest so the way we've done it for them is they have parts and then they have models for which these parts exist so then someone starts typing in eureka you actually show them the parts as well as the models for which these parts exist is there some kind of a correlation any specific fields i should know off where and you may want to do this .
prospect,you know i need to take a look at the details in the data i'm sure that there's something out there where we can make that correlation whether or not that exists in the connotative that's within magento i i'm not i don't think so but i i would have to dig a little deeper to answer that question .
rep,yeah that's fine not a problem and each of these residents that you see here so the vac plus one is essentially having two sets of popular products one is the models and the other one is the parts and that's all that you've given them so.
rep,all of these are configurable oh yeah definitely i'll share those with you and then you can let me know which one you like.
rep,okay all right and uh do you have a responsive site or a dedicated mobile website .
prospect,it's it's responsive it it does need a little bit of fixing at the lower lower breakpoints we've got all changes that have affected that but it is fully responsive.
rep,okay okay i'll make sure that are hosted page template uses a pretty much the same thing because you want to make sure it looks perfectly fine on desktop as well as on the mobile version .
rep,yeah i'm sure you must be using mobile analytics to keep a check on the reporting.
rep,we have that in function.
rep,okay you can see require a read-only access to your ga because that helps us and analyzing what other kind of those queries being made on the site what are the kind of conversions and making sure that we can optimise the page and all of that information.
prospect,okay will you give me an account that i can provide access to.
rep,yes i'll mail you the details.
rep,yeah and currently is just a deep for magento search or are you using any third party.
rep,oh yeah.
prospect,okay out of the box you can tell it's not very good.
prospect,and you know there there is a it's interesting i saw what's powering the category pages i think that there is some javascript and there's a sequel view that's being used it's it's one of the frustrations that i have with this height that i edited that so we'll see how that affects what it is you're trying to do if we have to make some adjustments there we'll talk about it that may may be a development thing but yeah i'm just i noticed your question about how the categories were being created and it's so it's still pretty much straight out of magento but i've seen a couple anomalies in our site in the code so.
rep,okay fine the next set of questions that i have is more on how the search listing page should look so i was just trying to see how your category pages look because it's gonna be powering the search pages and you want to make sure it's pretty much in singly what you are doing on your category pages so do you want to keep the pagination same as what you have currently you want to have an infinite scroll let me know what do you want to do with the pager nation.
prospect,i think you know let's keep it consistent i think you know if it's implement somewhere and not everywhere else it'd be frustrating for folks the same.
rep,okay and i did see that you have both the grid view and list view so we make sure we provide both as well and as part of search we also provide a spell check which automatically takes care of any spelling errors coming on the side what kind of a messaging would you want on such a page where our spell check has run just the standard did you mean or you have something specific in mind.
prospect,yeah i mean until we really have time to put more thought into it i think did you mean the most reasonable suggestion is appropriate it doesn't have to be fancy so that it is it is okay.
rep,okay yeah and you can change that you know if you wanted .
rep,okay floored by so i see that you're doing a sort by relevance by price by art number and part name do you want us to keep the same ones or do you also want us to add any other field out here.
prospect,you're distorting our show you need let's not take anything away but certainly if you have suggestions for improvement you know and you are with respect to taxonomy you know that's why we're we're looking at you guys as the experts for solving our search problems so i'm going to let you you know make some suggestions in those areas.
rep,right so what we do is you know once i've actually gone through your clearly done once i've seen your catalogue well we'll see if there is any other field we feel you should use for sorting option we definitely.
rep,okay okay what are the different overlays you're doing currently so i do see something for new arrival i will i just want to make sure we have a list of all of them so that we can you know incorporate to see.
prospect,so you have the entire product list.
rep,all of our note is this so you have this overlay here for new arrivals and or if i do see something for discounts i just want to make sure we having a strip all these overlays that you're using a sort of even it.
rep,yeah there may be a few more that we haven't turned on but we can certainly find out what what's what they are that's all coming out of the theme we're using a basic well um sure him off of theme park forest or envato or something like that i do have the full name but a lot of that's being handled there so.
rep,okay and all right so that's something you know once we can get a list of all of these we make sure we've added them and let us know in case you want us to add any new overlay that you may not have already.
rep,the <> we can add those.
rep,well i mean if you know if we have the option to add them or modify them i've heard some people say they wish they could see something else but i think starting with what we have is good and and discovering how to add to that will also would be nice over time .
rep,okay and just to make check while i'm here um are you using any kind of review system like a <> or something like that .
prospect,no no not at this time i mean we you know we been sending well we're using freezing mandrill so we've been asking for reviews kind of i think in the back hand after three weeks but that's about it .
prospect,are you familiar with the mandrel extension i mean it's not like the oppo at all but .
rep,right gotcha and so the reason i asked is because you know on the listing pages some people actually want to start showing in the rating the product waiting drinking on the listing page itself so that's something we generally do well a lot of times we are integrating the people information coming in<>.
prospect,yeah no it's not coming from a third party right now it's native magento and where we do have reviews you would see them and it's just using the basic reviews and star system better i don't that i see any would there's only a couple product or a pattern review at all so.
rep,certainly at some point you using something like <giotto> may improve art that you know if we started using him to go out and request those those ratings and reviews well we'll see.
rep,and um so do you currently have variants for any of these products that we should be made of anything to do with the configuration.
prospect,i don't know hang on second let me ask this question to a business mc r2 so i mean you know they need like a very to be like yellow red bar small in the motors i mean they're all pretty much like you're not stacking out the three more power motor then taking the meat you use and yeah i mean we don't really have any variance of size or color per se certainly we could have some you know kit type products or you know compound products but certainly we don't have those yet and we .
rep,those those variants are not not being used now.
rep,okay right .
prospect,yeah i mean we have a lot of the attributes that would be used in those cases but they're only being used as attributes they're not being used to as a selector they're all simple they're all simple product in the magento.
rep,okay okay sense it all are unique products essentially okay and okay .
rep,so i believe even for the fields to be displayed you just want to keep it same as a parent site because it has to be in sync with your category pages so i'm not going to change anything there oh right i think you are already striking that off in case of discount so we do the same thing for the out of stock products.
prospect,you want to go one question really quick you know just going up to the box above what attributes do you want to display i know that when we did the initial sales presentation that they were making some suggestions that you know we have in some cases filters that were really ineffective because you were filtering to what the results already was so again that goes back to when you guys see that type of thing from your your opinion as a professional search organization and you see a place where we could make an improvement i'd like to get that feedback from you.
rep,got you so what we do is so i'm gonna make sure so we've taken all of your inputs right now and once we have access to only this data i'm gonna come back to you and let you know it me you don't actually want you to make any other changes just because that could be a little better based or you know what do you seen so far so we'll definitely get back to you.
prospect,sure okay .
rep,and how do you want us to treat the out of stock products do you want us to hide them or do you want us to demote them to the bottom of the page okay and how do you want to treat the outer products do you want us to hide them or do you want us to demote them to the bottom of the page how would you wanna.
prospect,specifically in search results or.
rep,in search results yes.
prospect,yeah you know if they're if they're truly out of stock i'm not against showing them and you know what i think we're gonna change the message that says you know call us for availability or something like that but demote would be appropriate i suppose the motor show.
prospect,i'd like people to know that we could probably get it if it's really just a stock issue you know it may be truly a special order or something like that if we could help them with.
rep,can they add some kind of overlay for these do you already have something that says this is all the out of stock or you know me.
prospect,oh good question i i think we've kind of been turning them on and off to some extent i believe it does to show out of stock in place at the price i believe it's really.
prospect,is out of stock again we can we can find a couple and toggle and test on that and.
rep,that's fine we can connect again on you know how we should be showing this message so that's okay.
rep,and okay some of these are for infinite scroll i'm just going to move away and so what we'll do is we have a look at the different facets that you're using currently from magento and you'll see you know in case we find that there are some filters which are kind of you know redundant based on what the user is looking at then we will let you know on that but otherwise we try and keep them as much as same as the category pages.
rep,okay and price let me see how are you doing so you're not showing the price <> it at all do you want us to add that <> chance something like.
prospect,and scroll down a bit.<>
rep,yea.
prospect,it's just way down there it's a slider.
prospect,well yeah if you went to maybe.
rep,a category page maybe
rep,yeah let's yeah exactly you're the category page for eaters or filters i think yeah there it is so it's not on every page.
rep,got you so we love that.
prospect,not bad not even i'm honestly not even sure why you know part of part of this is we we inherited this site from a separate effort and this is still a little bit of discovery for us so you know we realized that search is broken and it's also refunds and other questions that should be answered so.
rep,okay all right so what we do is we keep the price right i seen it that you have on your category pages.
rep,okay now the other thing is of currently i don't see too much data where you may need an option to expand or collapse one of these facets but if we do find that you know there is a possibility either you may have too many values if that happens then we will include a view more and a show more or a show less option for every facets .
rep,i'm just gonna mark that as a guess for now.
rep,and let me see how this works for you currently so once a filter is selected what we do is we also add over here on the top what are the filters which have been selected and we provide a way for the user to directly clear all the viewers or you know clear any individual filter directly from one you know somewhere on top over here so those are the facets tags that's something we can provide to you by default at least in those pages you <> so.
prospect,here has a question on the on the pricing slider when there are no results that made a particular price.
prospect,yeah whats the message you would you be able to show<> or category so for example if you go to the price fighter that we're talking with our footboard.
prospect,price range from zero to zero.
prospect,oh yeah so if you move the right hand slider down to the lowest value.
prospect,so i guess yeah.
prospect,maybe we would be able to set the price range to what actual evangelist for that category or to show the lowest priced filters<>.
prospect,or i guess i guess that i guess the thing is that the filter goes down to zero can we stop that normally show the lowest post priced products like zero is not 0 it just is the lowest value right.
rep,right we can do that okay.
rep,that's something we can do and okay besides that you don't have product ratings oh that's fine.
prospect,we do yeah we do have banners enabled but it isn't running right now i kind of turned it off we have so much javascript running on the front end on the homepage it was really killing our site speed night shuttle out of it off so.
rep,that's the reason why i didn't ask you that question in magento have always seen everyone do that sure.
rep,yeah that's something well so what we also do is we provide you the banner feature directly from our end as well on the search pages but that's something and have been implementing once we've gone live so that's something we can definitely the discuss on is a content or marketing manager can really maintain that content from your system right.
prospect,yeah because what can happen to select if someone comes in searches for heaters and you have a specific banner you want to show when a lot of products from heaters are being shown in research page you can actually go ahead and configure them to make me from a dashboard so that's something that can be controlled.
prospect,can you guys address can you put any banners in the carters that off-limits.
rep,oh we can only put banner on the search page.
rep,okay yeah for mobile since you have a responsive site everything is gonna be pretty much similar to what we have discussed for the different well the only thing is we may come up with a design for how the filter should be and all of that that's something i will be able to discuss once we know just.
prospect,i'm sorry i design for which part
rep,for the filters on these pages let me see .
prospect,oh yes okay.
rep,so i believe this is now you're doing it currently so so currently oh did you have the filters you hey let's see.
prospect,yeah i don't think you they may be down fairly low if they still exist or we may have dropped them off let's see what's at the bottom there it's a good question but.
rep,so we can fix that you know at least to ensure that on these pages yeah i do see them at the bottom of the page what are you gonna do is give you something like a filter button here when you click on that there's an inline expand over here and you will be able to selecting wine set of facets from there i can share a few screen shots .
prospect,to make it more usable with the awesome.
rep,yeah so i can get a few layouts i'll send you a link to one of our uprights and let you know seek yourself how they<<<>>>and yeah i guess these were the only questions i had yeah one other thing is as part of the search now i know you're not using a recommendation but what we do is in case a user see zero results on a search page <> for some reason  unboxd is not able to showcase the results for a search query they actually show the recommended for you widget on those no source results pages so this eventually in case it's a new user it's going to start showing in some of the top trending products on your site and through being user it's gonna start showing in some products in which the user has shown some interest previously and you know some recommendations that's as part of your zero in some page and yeah that's about it let me know if you have any other questions.
prospect,well not so far i mean i i understand you'll either need to i don't know if you have the extension as a standalone certainly i'm not beyond installing the extension on the magento site and getting you guys connected in there or i can work with your engineering team to complete that so those are public if things they learn we're just really kind of ready to just keep moving through it and give you access is needed and keep just working through the process here until we're in good shape.
rep,yeah and so your staging and i'm sure you must be having stage staging site which speaking to<>.
prospect,it's it's a local it's a local set up right now but out on the primary server i intend to well i already have the container set up i just haven't created the database for the staging site yet so well we've got a couple efforts underway i'm just a couple steps behind yes there will be a staging site there's also a get report and this i know you i can send an invite for the base curve.
rep,alright that should be good yeah yeah that's in fact that's good enough for us to get started so i just created all this information and all the accesses that we require i'll turn in all the account details from my end and we can get it from them.
rep,all right and let me know if you have any other questions.
prospect,i'm sure well yeah i'm just you know i'm sure i'll have many as we move through the process right now just everything sounds like we're getting started so.
rep,i also give you an idea from an infrastructure standpoint in a scale newegg dot 
 com has just a shy of a hundred million products in their catalog and we run their search and target on the other side of the spectrum has few fewer products obviously not 100 million but they have 300 million searches happening a month and we also power their search so and you also work with a lot of pure online brands and we also work with a lot of platforms essentially making our solution platform agnostic you know and i can show you very quickly what that looks like so what are the three differentiators that unbox brings to the table one is technology we've solved some of the site search problems that were not solved before i'll show you those what those are business next is you actually customize our solution to fit your business needs and why customers buy from you and the third one is framework so one of the things that your <> told me that you're going from maybe three million active products to maybe say eight million in the next two or three years so new problems will come up when you have scale issues when you have relevancy issues or you start some specific categories that you may not have sold before the ide  a is that new problems may come up and a year from now six months from now so we also bring that aspect to the table they're going to bring a playbook that strategically and tactically helps you solve solve those challenges so how does our technology actually work so very quickly to give you an idea for every single query we do four distinct things were meant semantic relevance exclusion behavior learning and merchandising and when i say every single query what i mean is if i'm searching for a book versus books that's still the same query to us but if i'm looking for malcolm gladwell book versus just books those are two different queries to us okay so for each query what we try to do is these four things now what's it are the semantic relevance mean is that you have three techniques and aquitted techniques that are available to get boring ending and minimum match and i'm sure you you are aware of those and these each of these techniques create unique problems in terms of how relevancy works or doesn't work so sometimes with single word queries it might be okay but for multi word queries relevancy really gets screwed up just because of the way the technique might have been applied and the reason for that is that every search engine out there today uses the same technology called tf-idf that was developed in the 1970s so let's say if i looked at women's white jeans and i know it's not so vertical but just bear with me for this example women's why jeans why do i get a white top which is the typical occurrence that will happen when relevancy does not work either i get some bad results or totally bad results and the reason is the underlying algorithm tf-idf which is termed frequency or inverse document frequency only gives you popularity or where you score so a similar example let's say you had a very small catalogue dan say a thousand white sofas and 10 black chairs okay so to give you an idea if your thousand white sofas and 10 black chairs and if i search for a black sofas what tf-idf will look at it and say black only comes up exist 10 times out of 1000 and 10 times where's the sofa exists thousand times out of 1000 and 10 times what will now happen is that tf-idf will think that black is more important so it will show all the products that has the word black in it so ultimately we end up showing black chairs and that's not necessarily the intent the intent is that sofa is a more important keyword even though you don't have black sofas you still want to show sofas so that's the problem first problem that unbox halls by creating another layer on top of ideas called elements game so we actually identify which keyword is more important as it relates to the other keywords in the query and then show the results based on that so now.
prospect,what how do you a quick question there yes i mean one of the issues we've had and i understand that totally but the challenge is we don't have any bright words in that that are typically rising to the extent that sofa would over color so in in the book title there rarely are bright words that make those words rise significantly above the others there are some that are noise words but not a lot of bright word so how do you go about making that kind of differentiation in a case where the words are relatively the same way.
rep,right so give me an example where you feel that the words are relatively the same work if you can just give me one idea i can give you an example of why in terms of how we look at the wait edge of the words against each other so let me simplify another example let's say i was looking for bags versus handbags versus bean bags.
rep,okay so if i'm looking for bags bean bags and handbags the context of the word bag changes with the presence of the word being in it so it's not that one word is more important than the other the idea is that the context of one word in relation to the other right so the context actually changes which is what the semantic aspect of it is and that's what we're trying to say so if if let's say for example i am looking for malcolm gladwell books or just malcolm gladwell it's not that we're saying gladwell is more important than malcolm that's not the idea the presence of both words together creates and yet another context and that's that's what we're trying to do here it's understanding the context with one word or the presence of other words in the context of each other hopefully that .
prospect,okay i kind of get you we just had we've struggled with making that work well so i guess what i'm then defer here is assuming you have and we haven't and shut up about your talk.
rep,yeah exactly .
rep,and it's not that you know by the way from a semantic irrelevance perspective it's not we're coming and saying oh you've got everything not nailed down 100% there is no such thing as hundred percent but what we've come up with the ability to is to actually tune the system in such a way and actually figure that out for you and it gets better over time maybe not the perfect way it's day one maybe it's 70% day one and it gets better over time so that's that's the essence of this and that's not the only thing that we do by the way so that's first step one of four step two is to try to understand the meaning of each word and this is where we've built this by scanning on 100000 ecommerce site indexing almost 200 200 million products in our system to create an algorithm that actually understands when i search for say women's white jeans that jeans is the product white is the color attribute and women's is the gender attribute and so now what happens is which is another big problem is that when you get search results you may try to solve the relevancy up to a certain extent but you always have loosely relevant products in the catalog or in the results that also like for example let's say this white top shows up the white top also shows up because it might have somewhere in the description where it says this goes great with jeans so it still has women's white and jeans words in it in the title description etc and so it's still loosely relevant so now what happens is we actually identify the type of product this is and i understand that in your world everything is books but even within books you probably know that there is categorization and subcategories ation as to how products can be differentiated the question comes in now is if i understand that jeans is the product and i know in the results said i have tops as products also the tops are not the same as jeans so that's the second thing that we do we now actually exclude loosely relevant products because they are not the actual product and we show more relevant products up top then the third thing is we also do user behavior search where we're actually tracking clickstream data where we track all the clicks that a customer does whether they are searching or not searching so product click searches click through add to cart buys filters pagination sorting every single click gets track and using that data in the context of that query again we try to figure out what is your star product okay so women's white jeans may have this product as the star product white jeans may have this product as a star product so it may have different sets of products that are different for different queries and so then you reorder the products based on popularity based on that clicks from data and then the last piece that we do is what we call merchandising which is again something that depending on your lasting search you may have experienced that maybe not maybe switch to solar you'll experience that where if you want to merchandise products and reorder them based on whatever business rules there might be there's no consistent way to do merchandising you always have to use some random number of points but here i want to boost this shoe up top have i boosted by 10 points which may not be enough so i boosted by 20 points for a different query the range might be 1 to 100 so certainly now i have two boosted by hundred and twenty points and sometimes some of these products get boosted so much that they start to show up all over the place even though they were not intended to show up in that instance and so that's what another problem that we solved by normalizing this process so all merchants basically use percentages to boost to boost the products so that's the technology aspect of it here's some of these to give you a very quick overview of what the limitations of elasticsearch or solar are so you can get what's the middle box from solar or elasticsearch but you need all the other blue boxes to make it a really good search system including real time merchandising so you'll have to build dashboards to actually have merchants and marketing team to be able to do a lot of things so they don't bother it all the time next is a lot of context awareness so you get the relevancy controls the synonym corpuses stemming spellcheck etc autocomplete from a ui perspective to help guide the customer and i'll show you some examples of what we do next is self learning algorithms the user behavior stuff that we talked about and the infrastructure to scale so i'm pretty sure that you have a huge expense in terms of the infrastructure just to host three million proactiv products and typically if you grow that's going to grow so that's just from a pure cost perspective that's also something years to manage but then how do you do analysis if you wanted to start changing and making changes to search from a user behavior based then you need even more infrastructure to be able to do that and you need a lot of manual work to scale .
rep,so unboxd actually solves all of these requirements and we've built a product that took or three years for us to build 16 engineers would do to give you a context by the way target has 22 search engineers dedicated just to search . amazon has almost 50 that we can tell by the way by looking at their linkedin profile and and still it's not an easy problem to solve so there's there's a level that we take you to from where you are from that perspective okay .
rep,any questions so far .
prospect,no i mean great .
rep,okay so let me show you how the business aspect really works and i'll give you quick couple examples to give you an idea of what this really looks like so give me one second okay .
rep,let's start with this okay so here's just to give you an idea from a business perspective how we really think differently for different businesses and verticals to give you an idea of the word totality of our approach so here's parts warehouse almost a thirty million dollar company annual revenue pure online they sell parts for different appliances they used to have two search boxes one for parts one for models we obviously came in and questioned that because you're putting the onus on the customer they could pick the wrong search box or you can only optimize one search box at a time so now you can see here just within the autocomplete as soon as i start to type in we split the autocomplete into two parts one for parts and one for models and this way we are able to cover both bases in terms of their customer behavior here's apparel world very simple very different catalog customers are more looking to engage in what they're trying to do so we need to guide them very quickly to category subcategory or specific set of products or help them with some keyword suggestions next is a grocery customer so here we had this customer who has users buying 15 products in a single transaction okay and the problem obviously was that it took almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these products so under the theory that in grocery you typically buy the same products that you normally buy to replenish your pantry every week or review of the week you redesign the autocomplete to look like this where every single customer gets a personalized experience based on what they've bought in the past so if i've bought if i bought chicken boneless breasts i'll see that up top if you've bought chicken without skin you'll see that up top and you can add two cards from right here and you also get to see commonly searched terms popular brands and categories to help you with products that you don't normally buy so this hopefully gives you an idea of how we try to solve different problems that customers face it's not a one solution that's designed for every single one of them very different solutions for different customers we also have from a relevancy perspective solve 12 different types of queries every single type of query requires a different algorithm to solve them next is spellcheck so we have automated spellcheck 85 to 90% of spell check spell check queries are automatically solved in today i am assuming dan that murrah marketing or merchandising has to create a lot of synonyms on the back end to accommodate for something like this all right yeah yep you do not have to do that with us in fact let me just quickly show you something okay here's all the reasons why you don't have to do synonyms and if you do need synonyms what is capable to our system so any kind of plural you do not have to create synonyms it's automatically taking care of any kind of stemming gaming game central center run running automatically done by our spell check automatic by us however you do want to create synonyms to create certain kind of business rules you do get the ability to add three kinds bi-directional unidirectional replacements and ends and we can get into some of these details in a longer conversation from a experience perspective we also find ways to guide the customer two different sets of products so here i search for mobile crosses a lot of different categories how do i find all the subcategories show them in the order of importance will also always show some products another interpretation i searched for alexander wang so here let me show you quick i searched for alexander wang who is it designer makes a lot of different categories of products which could also be the case where a customer is looking for an author who may have jaw on different genres of books so how do i show the results neatly bucketed into different categories but still all show all the products that that query matches so i show here all the tote bags made by alexander wang all the shoulder bags made by alexander wang then i can scroll down dresses sandals pants etc so a unique way to neatly bucket all the products in two categories or genres in your case four that are relevant to what the customer is searching for.
rep,next real quick is the filters so depending on and this may not be yes applicable but you can have dynamic filters based on the category of products that the customers are searching for so for specific genres may be customers are more interested in specific set of attribution you can actually identify that define at once and the search system will automatically take care of it no matter how you search so if i fit so example is i said these filters up for shoes as a category it doesn't matter how i search for shoes search will automatically pick up those filters so shoes casual shoes men's shoes and man's casual shoes does not matter how you search a large filter options you get two pieces search within the filter or reorder the results based on that you also get variances that this is more of your parallel world but you get variance if you have the same product in different variances we solve that problem color synonyms a built in synonym corpus four colors zero results option page we believe in today's day and age you want to give the customer the ability to go back or to go forward on a zero results page so we show recently viewed or recommendations that are homegrown by unboxd .
rep,does that give you guys an idea.
prospect,yeah i guess you know trying to connect the dots between the theory of what you're saying in the reality of our book inventory.
prospect,so is is the part that i you know we need to look at carefully or they have some kind of a demonstration of concept along well i know.
rep,yeah absolutely i mean so we are absolutely open in however you want to feel comfortable in terms of evaluating what we do now obviously the best way to do it is if you can share your catalog with us so we can index it that way and give you an idea of what that looks like and from the relevancy perspective and it minimizes the effort one of the other ways what we've done dan just to give you an idea we've shared this with matt .
rep,we also have a performance guarantee that we provide in our solution so what that means is let's say you decide to work with us and give us a try we'll analyse your analytics data give us access to some of your analytics data and we can send you those questions will come back and say okay this is what we believe we can help you grow to the next level in terms of performance give us a chance to do it for 90 days and this is what we believe in the next 90 days is what will perform at if we don't perform at that level you walk away you don't pay us anything.
rep,yeah if you go you take it to the next level and then you integrate.
prospect,yeah so my point of view i think i need to talk to matt obviously did you say you sent over some technical docs to him already or can you send them over to us now.
rep,i can certainly send them over to you i can just give you an idea of what i had prepared so you can see it so here is the approach okay so basically we need your catalogue to index into whatever shape or form that you can send us or if you also have a standard format that you can upload if you want so there's two methods to that and then we need analytics integration into your back-end which is very similar to ga analytics where you drop in a javascript and some html tags.
rep,so those are the two things we need from you there's two ways to implement what is the hosted search so you can.
rep,i can show you what this looks like posted <> you can see here rods comm if i search for jenes it goes to search dot rods dot com and search dot rods dot com search dot rods dot com is completely hosted by us.
rep,now this you can do for a 90-day trial period for example if you were to come in and say let's just give these guys 10% traffic or 20% traffic depending on what they're comfortable with and we can try the hosted search for 90 days so it's minimum impact on you maximum impact on us or the onus is on us and all you do is get us a sub domain redirect sub domain to us if there's an ssl or anything like and enable course and that's it the second option is the back end which is what obviously you want to use for the long term but it requires more onus on you and your team so we suggest the hosted search for short term while you prove us out we prove prove it to you you want to now take the long term approach you can do the back end and now you can dedicate engineers to do it just do some of the back and work and it's restful api is responses in json xml that you can render.
prospect,okay <> send it over and i'll <> man we'll set up a follow-up call to you know may be get back to where you were expecting to talk today a little bit more .
rep,yeah no problem.
rep,so that's totally fair i just wanted to understand dan and matt just a quick question what is the timeline that you guys are thinking because we are approaching the holiday season i i'm pretty sure that your world also gets impacted because of holidays i want to make sure you're are you expecting to make a change before december or this is something is post december so i can schedule resources accordingly or at least give them as.
prospect,well i'm not sure we have any kind of commitment we want to make it all but my assumption is if this proves out with some discussion and potentially the proof of concept maybe with the subdomain for fast proof i mean we want to move on this pretty quickly of all the pieces lined up.
rep,yeah no commitment.
rep,really quickly means exactly but just you know really quickly means really quickly so if we could i'd like to make sure we do it before the holidays i but you know we have a lot of parts from here we'd have to discuss yeah and that the.
prospect,holidays are upon us.
prospect,and we're getting below basic yeah we're getting close.
rep,yeah exactly that's why i wanted to sort of figure out is if we and it's okay that we don't do it before the holidays and we do it after that's totally fair i just want to make sure that if not that you're making a commitment that if you have interest will you be able to move quickly enough will or so that i can move quickly enough with you guys and if there is an anticipation before the holidays that's all i was looking for if there's not if they're still up in the air we can take play by ear whenever we get to that point i'm sure there's a cut-off time we can or can't do it and we'll take the decision accordingly but we're more than happy to do it either way just wanted to get a heads-up from you guys so that's all.
prospect,well here's anticipation i think we can't really save you on that until i look at the implementation pieces both for the test and for the final piece if it's straightforward you know we have resources here they can make it happen fairly quickly but without seeing the details of it i can't speak to it .
rep,so all i can say from my point of view and matt can override this is there's definite interest and the sooner the better if it all lines up but you know .
prospect,i did depending on how difficult the implementation is is we can move very quickly that's common feedback we get from a lot of our vendors is we're a lot more responsive than some other companies that they work with.
prospect,we've got resources that can make it happen if it all lines up.
prospect,just the pricing again i don't know that we had talked about it briefly but um and we can also hold that off till a later call too.
rep,yeah the only reason we don't have the perfect pricing is because we want to make sure that me give you a pricing in the context of what we're going to help you as a proof of concept so we can send you some questions to give you an idea of what we were looking for and i can give you an idea of what our pricing looks like from a base model perspective so i can certainly do that absolutely i can send you that information as well so i can walk you through that our next call that is not a problem.
prospect,okay so yeah what go ahead and send that over and then let's as part of that send me some times that you're available maybe later in the week that we could set up the next call.
rep,absolutely i can tell you right now if you have your calendars in front of you gentlemen.
prospect,you know we have to up on another call it's starting right now yeah we already stopped and fortunately.
rep,yep no problem.
prospect,but i'm joined sometimes and we'll get it set up.
rep,perfect sounds good sir.
prospect,okay thanks so much.
rep,for our engines can start the internet nation so it's just a checklist of things i want to walk you through and just fill in some of these details and<>.
rep,okay so i'm going to share my screen let me know once i did it i'd say okay all right so currently you are in magento platform right.
rep,and you're looking for implement implementation of site search only so and the way that you did with this implementation is we have a magento plugin so that helps us in getting out the product catalog directly from the sequel database within magento and once we have that you will be doing an engaged in acts implementation within your magento environment so a quick thing i want to show you is i hope you have a staging environment which is an absolute replica of your production.
rep,okay so you just require access to that we require a magento admin panel axis we require an ftp or an ssh access to the same server i will obviously send out these decays to for an email but these are the couple of things that you require from your end for us to do the implementation.
prospect,sure one question.
prospect,i'm like yeah so we are currently in the middle of a platform upgrade for magento we're about one maybe two weeks out from going live from 1 6 121 9 point to would you want to have access to the 1 9 point to staging environment.
rep,yes that would be better so i think it's best that you know after you finish all the work in the next couple of weeks you can provide us the access then because with magento we've just seen you know couple of teams making the changes together and it can you know lineups doing a few things so we just want to make sure that when we are working on the staging environment your team has already finished all the work that they're doing so i think it's best you give us the access then.
prospect,ok perfect.
rep,all right and so the product catalogue page as i said this should be able directly pulling from are plucking a couple of other questions i had wrong feet are there any attributes like price that change depending on the customer loan or customer segment anything oh that's all.
rep,and another thing would be any changes or price or any other attribute based on any customer logging in anything of that sort.
prospect,i don't believe so this is linked on page display price correct not like an in cart price.
rep,thats correct.
prospect,then.
rep,okay the next question i have is around how do you want the type-ahead to look like i think the one that you have right now is the default one coming in from magento though so let me just show you how are some of the layouts that we have okay you see the screen.
rep,okay so lot of different ways in which you can happy order suggest the first one that you see here on the left hand side this is a side by side order suggest so the way it works is the first thing that you see here is what we call the guided autosuggest so basically we segment the data based on categories subcategories product type brand or any of these other attributes and then try and segregate the data based on that then someone starts searching in for something so if here in this example if someone is searching for t-shirts we have segmented the data based on brands and as somehow a user clicks on any of these brands they will see the results for t-shirts with the filter nike or puma as they select so that's guided search then we have the popular product section now this section is based on or the real-time analytics tracking and aggregation that we do for the product clicks or active carts cards and the orders so based on all of this data which we keep checking which are the most popular products for any specific way that is being typed in so based on this aggregation we come up with the popular products then we have the top query section again this is something that is populated through our analytics intubation we keep a check a real-time check on the queries that are being searched for on the side and we keep aggregating and based on this we come up with the top queries   list depending on you know what the query is typed in you will start seeing in the top queries coming in we then have the keyword suggestions section now this is something that is controlled from the backend this can be configured based on some of the important attributes coming in from your end again this is something which is set by unboxed third team internally based on some of the best practices and you know basically just going through some your previous data to see how people are trying to search for products on the side and then coming up with the right combinations for example it could be category it could be a brand plus category it could be a color plus product type it could be any of these combinations so it's just a matter of configuring that from the back end to get that working within the auto suggest so these are the core sections but they're lot of a phase in which you can show this data it could have two box or a suggests to be a single box auto suggest it was a test you can change the position where you see any of these coming in all of that can be controlled from our side just want to know what i also do is i'll probably send you around eight to ten different kinds of layouts there we've done for some of our other customers you can go through that list and then let us know which one which design you like the best .
rep,any questions on auto suggest .
rep,so i will send out those details over email <> okay all right.
rep,do you have a responsive site or do you have a dedicated mobile website.
prospect,responsive.
rep,alright and i'm assuming you must be using google analytics on your end to keep track on the numbers.
rep,it's all we require read-only access to that it just helps us in understanding how to use would have been searching for products on the site the second such configurations as.
rep,so i guess currently are using default magento right.
rep,okay alright and okay the next set of questions i have is more around how the search layout should look like so let me just quickly search for something here so do you want us to mirror the way you have the search page right now do you want us to keep the layout exactly the same way.
prospect,yes unless you have suggestions you know kind of based on indications but for the most part yes.
rep,okay you want me to do it so most of this part that you see here on the right hand side this whole day you know where you're having the pagination the sort by option and the search listing we keep it the way exactly the way you have it right now but the left-hand side this is what is gonna change a bit because we wanna provide you multiples select feature multiple active selection within the filters so you may want to have different checkboxes so that you can select multiple attributes at any point of time so that's something that's going to change.
rep,but for the most part we'll try and keep it just the way you have it right now because you also have the category pages and you want to make sure that you know there isn't too much of a difference in the design and layout between the two pages so just so you know you can provide multiple search result layout <> analyst <> so it depends on what you want i see it right now you only ever do so i guess we're just gonna keep it the same way.
rep,i know it's part of the unboxers product we also provide a spellcheck algorithm that automatically takes care of any spelling errors done by the users on the site the only question i have for you is what kind of a messaging would you want would it just be a standard with you meaning and sky pretty or something basic.
prospect,the default one.
rep,okay all right now let's see the sort of the currently have sort by relevance name and price is there anything else you would want sort on or do you just want to go ahead start with these and then maybe as we go ahead and see or data we'll let you know what could be some of the other sort options if you can add.
prospect,<> ya you can determine popularity which i think we've talked about that would be the only other thing i could i could see adding.
rep,right so so what happens is now that unboxed with unboxer it's a default sort would always be by relevance now relevance would be won of course what is the relevancy of the product to the search but apart from that it would also be you know looking at providing some amount of popularity on top of this which is again based on the click static arts in orders for a product so you'd be a mix of relevancy and user behavior but if you want another sort just feed on the orders you could do that you know we can have a whole sort which will just be say sort by popularity which will essentially be sort fury based on the orders data it could do that as well .
prospect,yeah let's let's plan on doing that i think that could be useful .
rep,okay relevance price popularity.
rep,okay okay now i have any kind of overlays that you use let's say to tell if a product is out of stock or on sale is there any overlay that you use for that.
prospect,not currently
rep,okay. so at any point of time you update the overlay from you're end in there is no we can add same on this listing pages as well.
rep,all right um is now are each of these products unique products or do you also have some kind of child products or is .
prospect,the only child products our size so if there's different colors currently all the different colors are their own parent products.
rep,oh so only size variance so obviously that in search you can always drop them as a single product when you are listing them correct.
rep,this naturally see miss currents size and price i guess you are spreading it all yes okay how do you want us to treat the out of the stock products do you want us to hide them completely or do you want us to remove them to the bottom of the pages how do you want us to.
prospect,good question let's denote for the typing.
rep,okay all right now some of these questions are<>.
rep,what feels you want us facts filter i'm assuming it's gonna be the same list that you're using on category pages.
rep,and if you want us to add any more filters it'll keep posted otherwise be automatically that data up from the filters that you are using category basis.
rep,and how do you want the price let's see how so currently you don't have a price pastor do you want us to add a price pastor or we don't see anyone like.
prospect,potentially i might need to fresh that out a little bit more could we add that later.
rep,yeah we could add that later we could have couple of different kinds of price pastor layout i can share that with you as well so you could know could how would you do that.
rep,then we  could do it later that's fine okay now for fast as i just want to show you something so i'm just taking you to your demo side of us just to show you how we've done a few of the pastor so basically they are gonna have it check this off you know checkbox here so then you can select multiple number of values let me try opening up an outside and let's see how your all right yeah so just the way you are currently if value is selected you kind of add that on the top of the page we'll make sure that we have the same functionality on our end you'll have these price pastor coming in today you have right now the only thing that's gonna change looks like it's looking a bit slow for me so it's clear with me for that or in case if you are you can open this link on you are and as well you go to any of that category pages or certain pages you will be able to see how we are handling the pastor for them how they are multi selective nature how we are adding the pastor tags and you select any of those values as much all right looks like i'm more able to open that up here so so one way of doing these facets and filters would be now you have these little checkboxes here and then you may have a lot of different values for example in this category pastor it there's an option to expand so view more or a view less option and asking how you keep selecting any of these we start showing in the pastor tags over here so a lot of different ways i'm handling this just so you know that you could do it any of these ways the other way would just be instead of doing an inline expand it could just be a strolling list that's something like this and as an how i keep selected i keep adding the passage i can pop.
rep,so you just want a simple scroll feature or would you rather have a view more view less option.
rep,i'd rather do the scroll.
rep,okay all right so it's gonna be expand all right another quick question so i do see ratings i am assuming this is likely coming in from the magenta there's no third party that is providing this or.
rep,that's magento okay and i'm assuming that want to make sure that any product is searchable through its product id right.
prospect,yes that's correct.
rep,all right so i guess those are the only question i've had and another quick thing so obviously unbox will ensure that you know we show in the relevant results for most people so much queries but there could be some specific search where for which unbox might not be able to show any result simply because it does not exist in the catalogue and all of that in these cases unbox will ensure that we provide a personalized recommendation widget for the user on the no results page so the way this would work is if the user is new we obviously don't have any data for this new user on the site so we start to showcase is some of the top trending products on the site and in case it's a bit user where we have some specific clicked and available for this user we start recommending some of the products based on the user's past history so that's the recommendation which would go on the zero exactly.
rep,yeah all right so i guess those are the questions i have do you have any questions.
prospect,i don't except for what email address or we should we should be able to set up our google analytics and magento admin for.
rep,okay thank you so much for your time and i'll drop you an email in some time.
prospect,sounds great thank you.
rep,our recommendations as well as the search i think the best way of approaching this would be we get your team to do the recommendations because that's something which is very straightforward and all you need to do is you know add an analytics integrate our shopify module get the recommendation up and running and just put in some of the bibtex snippets to actually get the recommendations live on your site and post-trial any of the design changes and all of that can be taken care by your team or through our recommendation that's what it says but i hope you'll follow these steps in a bit as well but in search it's going to be a little i think if best if our team gets involved and gets the search up and running because for shopify the plugin that we have automatically takes care of the data feed which we need to get but some of the other elements for search like the facets and the filter is the way the search testing page should come up you know getting in our autosuggest and all of that it's best that we actually get our team to interpret or the search piece for this so i think we just walk you through the recommendation step first and then move on to the search.
rep,yeah you have any questions so far.
prospect,i dont think so. maybe one i don't think we've even set up accounts or anything is that just something you guys have helped us do at some point or do we do all this through shopify i have it all kind of work.
rep,yeah yeah so there are two ways of doing this either you can just give us the admin access and we can take care of installing our module directly from the store or in otherwise you can just directly go to the shopify app store and search for unboxed and just get our module installed from there the unbox recommendations module and during the installation of that there will be a couple of questions about selecting a plan and all of that i can send an all these steps to you so that it's a lot easier for you to fall of them and once you've selected the right plan you're just taken to the different set of steps the first one being the integration of the analytics on your site so this is for tracking the clicks cards the orders for the recommendations as such and this just involves including specific snippets and our module itself will directly go directly you know from our dashboard and what are some of these elements that need to be added on the specific places within shopify so it's a self you know sustainable model out here where you can actually go through each of these steps and you will be shown what others different steps or analytics information for recommendations and all of these so let me just walk it through how each of these look like so for example this is what needs to be added for the recommended for you so let me just show you the analytics integration first so yeah these are the kind of snippets that you need to add on all the pages the javascript codes and then we have these simple div tag placements for the clicks add to cards and the orders so all you need to do is add these at the right places and the module when you install the module it will just take you through each one of these steps automatically one after the other and it will validate for you whether whatever you can enter it is tracking things correctly or not so all of that will be taken care of on its own so talents for the analytics integration and then we of course have the recommendations part as well so then you can choose you know which widget needs to go on which of these pages so you can just all you need to do is paste the snippets on the index dot liquid for the specific page location that you want to add this one because some of these you would want to add on the home page like your home page top sellers there'll be some of those which you'd want to add on the product description pages like the more like these and the viewed also viewed so it's a pretty straightforward thing and you can get down in you know two to three hours to actually get the recommendations up and running one on your site so if there's a specific design you have in your mind i can get my team to do this integration as well and this is how simple it is to get the recommendations up and running there's nothing to it so let me know if you have any questions on the recommendations.
prospect,go ahead.
rep,okay so so this is pretty straightforward but the first is the piece where there are a lot of elements involved so this documentation for example will give you an idea of the different steps that are involved within search so product feed is something been obviously getting directly from the recommendation module that we have on shopify so that's not a problem the analytics integration is something that is again taken care of through the recommendation module itself so again nothing new you gotta do there but then we have two of these pieces one is the unboxers and one is the autosuggest now let's go to unboxd so the first thing we have in unboxd site is <> we do is we do an in page ajax implementation on the shopify templates so that we can get our running during this inferior ajax implementation what we take care of is ensuring that the service listings work the way they are supposed to the facets and the filters are you know put on the left-hand side and then you multi select in nature and so on so all of those elements are taken care off within this as well and beside that what you also have to take care is any of the pagination that's working how we need to go ahead and implement that and all the sort options that you have for a sort by price and sort by name or sort by bestsellers and so on so there are a lot of these elements that we need to integrate as part of the third solution and that's the reason why it's best that i can get our team to work on this you're talking about up four to five days of implementation time at our end to get this up and running .
rep,and we're talking filters we are talking facets and we are also talking about implementing a spell check algorithm to take like you know ensure that in case someone typed in something wrong i'm boss can actually go ahead and start showing in the results for the right query so implementing all this could be a bit cumbersome if you get your team to do because there'll be a lot of concentration required from our end to get this up and running at your end so i think it's best that we actually get it done at the unboxd in itself and apart from this because the autosuggest the type-ahead that you'll see when you go to any of the sites when you start typing in the search box so this is something pretty simple pretty straightforward we'll be showing you a few of the design layouts that we do and it's just going to be a java script which needs to be put in all the pages and you know getting the search up and running over there so any questions on this aren't otherwise i can just quickly run you through a few things within the autosuggest as well.
prospect,okay that's perfect.
rep,okay all right so do you think it'll be easy for us to get the admin access for your shopify account or do you want to install that on your own and you know provide us the access later on.
prospect,i think we want to try to do as much of it on our own as we can this could kind of helps us learn to sew i mean i don't k now what works we couldn't but we have a whole development team at our disposal here too so we can just get these documents and stuffs we'd be more than happy to give it a try.
rep,okay okay so i would suggest we can get you know your team to work on the recommendations part and in parallel we can get our team to do the search part because it's just that search has a lot of these different elements and we can i please just get some of the basic code up and running over that on on one of the test teams on your end and then your team can then go ahead and make any modifications that they want on top of that.
prospect,okay so you need admin access to our site is that what you're saying or.
rep,yep oh yeah it'll be great if you can provide us the admin access or your team can go ahead and install it from the shopify app and i have and then just give us access to one of the test teams so then we can go ahead and implement our search over there.
prospect,okay where do we go in and you know once this is all set up where do we go and we go in through shopify are we going through unboxd to make it any changes or anything.
rep,so if it's change with respect to you know how the search is working and all of that then you go to the unboxd dashboard and if it's a code level change where you're just talking about changing how the search is coming up the design elements or the filters and all of that then you need to go within shopify itself on the unboxed and you don't just make any changes for the search phase that we may already have with in the search template so it depends if you're talking just about the search results it's going to be the unbox dashboard.
prospect,okay so at some point will we use need to create an boxed accounts or maybe i already yeah.
rep,so the unboxd account will be created as soon as you install the shopify module the unboxd module well that'll be taken care<>.
prospect,you'll take you'll install the module or whatever.
rep,yeah give us the i mean access we gave that up and running it just takes a few minutes to get that done.
rep,and then you can give the control to your team to start working on the recommendations i think i can get one of my engineers to make sure that he can consult your team in case anything is required and i'm hoping so so we will also do part one of these test teams to you know work on the search piece while so what we want to do is just make a copy of the latest code changes that you may have done in the templates and then we will just make a copy of that and make all our changes there and then you can get your team to review it and you know make any other changes that's required and take it like.
prospect,okay okay how so how long do you think to have the search up and running and stuff how long do you think overall that would take like a couple days.
rep,first start talking something basic would be done up and running in three days and after that we can just let your team do any of the fine-tuning that they want to do<>.
prospect,okay that'd be really good we have a meeting monday that we want to kind of show the search capabilities there's anyway i know it's kind of late in the week but if there's any way of having that up and going first the next week that would be huge for us.
prospect,yeah you are good.
prospect,sorry you're kind of breaking out there what what you say.
rep,so well when are you targeting to date this whole thing live is that in the next couple of weeks are to be next as well.
prospect,oh we're kind of what we're trying to show a proof of concept to our bosses and the search is kind of the part that's not clearly defined yet so that's why we wanted it for this meeting next week to kind of show them hey we can do this with unboxd you know cuz search is an important part of what we do so we're it's kind of like a proof of concept and if that goes well we would roll out sometime shortly after.
rep,so okay so let me let me see so it's not really necessary for the whole thing to be working completely as long as we have some autosuggest to show some kind of features coming in and some of the search results coming in will that still be okay because we can get some rough version ready if possible by that next monday or tuesday but it's not gonna be something which you would want to take life right away it's not something you could just roll out right away if you have to do something so quickly.
prospect,okay yeah i mean i think as as far as we can get by by then yet monday would be awesome and that will that be like will i give us like capability going like add some filters like for the navigation on the sidebar and stuff like that will we have that capability okay cool.
prospect,yeah this site doesn't have a whole lot to it yet or anything so it's .
rep,but how be.
rep,yeah yeah go ahead.
prospect,sorry you go ahead.
rep,okay i was just saying how big is the product catalogue.
prospect,right now that's why i've been kind of waiting to push them all up there right now what's <> is about like probably 30 bats baseball bats but we have probably about another three or four hundred products we could push live like right now i was kind of wait and see what we need to do here.
rep,so probably we could have product about between 350 and 400 products.
prospect,all right cool.
rep,all right any other questions.
rep,no i don't think <<<>>>very hands-on and i think we'll have more questions once we get it implemented it's hard for us to really grasp it right now but once it's in there and we're pretty good you're resourceful about figuring stuff out so yeah the sooner we can get it just plugged in over your in <<<>>> a
rep,ll right great so will do this face we get your team to do the recommendations we get our team working on search as soon as possible and i just create i just sent out an email you know when the engineer who's gonna be helping from rn as well just in case your team has any questions so that we are all on the same page.
 cool.
rep,all right hey <<<<>>>> on anything from your end.
rep,i know from my perspective as long as andrew and dustin you guys are okay the plan seems to fit into what your schedule looks like you just want to make sure we are able to deliver on time and what you expect.
prospect,sure and we know it's kind of a quick turnaround but again it's more of a proof of concept you know that we're showing to our bosses a this shopify site can do it what we want you know search works this works that works and then the idea of adding that to the other side that we talked to you about a couple months back that would come later.
rep,yep absolutely that's completely understand that and like i said we are here with the focus on this site making sure this site works for you you're able to launch and do what you gotta do for this particular site.
rep,is that a tentative launch date john.
prospect,just so that i know not really like we said i mean we just kind of need to see to see it and you know whenever we can we'd like to launch but serge is just so important we want to make sure we fully understand it i mean if we had it all kind of up and running so comfortable we'd love to have it but before the first that yeah before december.
rep,okay that's fair all right and did you guys decide on domain.
prospect,yeah now we're still kind of working that part out the domain yeah yeah we've got we've got some of our guys looking at been trying to get the name that we want so.
rep,i see playing in the game right does the showed.
rep,so we gotta track them.
prospect,track down a couple of people so.
rep,gotcha oh god oh you're buying a domain makes sense okay yeah yeah i know that's always fun so okay now that's fair so ridhima from our perspective you're gonna the next steps are you're gonna get back to them with a timeline and pacific seductions so these they can get started on some cheese and in parallel we can get something else done also right.
rep,yes okay all right awesome well any questions gentlemen if not i am good.
prospect,yeah i think in payments and stuff just you know let us know you know if there's an invoice that need sent you know for this first part or whatever just in it we're gonna take care of.
rep,sounds good.
rep,well let's get the plan figured out we'll take care of money as soon as that works out no problem.
prospect,perfect sounds great.
prospect,alright awesome thanks guys thanks for the.
rep,thank you no problem.
prospect,e-commerce platform but it's tied to our inventory and crm system so and it is it's not very common okay.
rep,can you give you the name for that.
prospect,it's yes the the company that makes the platform is called epicor.
prospect,okay yeah the the platform is actually b2b let's now b2b seller i think it's what they call it.
rep,okay and i believe you're just looking at implementation of site search for now so that's what we have all our questions on and i do believe it oh he did tell me some time back that you are interested in doing an in page ajax implementation .
prospect,right it's possible yes i'd like to do it that way.
rep,perfect that's actually one of the fastest way of implementing this as well and i also gotta hear that you want to go alive around somewhere in the first week of february so taking that into consideration i think it would be the best okay .
rep,well the first question i have is how do you think we should be putting in the product catalog is there a specific api that epicor exposes  or would you like to do in ftp push to us.
prospect,i'm trying to think through how we had a couple different conversations about this um i don't think that we have an api right now so it probably is going to have to be an ftp .
rep,okayso maybe just start off with you know we will share our ftp details with you and you can just put in a sample feed over there so that we can have a look and figure out how to convert that to an unbox readable format take .
rep,wait the next thing i want to take you through is our autosuggest now i'm sure monal  must have already taken you through this but i just wanted to kind of give you an idea of the different things that we can do within this auto suggest so.
rep,this is a sample the first one that you see here on the left side right so right essentially there are four different parts within this autosuggest so the first thing that you see here on the left side this is the guided search that we have so we call this a guided smash because you can segment the data on categories brands or sub  categories and so on so whenever yeah someone is searching for t-shirts you could segment this database on brands or categories or mix of both  so we take that we make these configurations based on think that people are searching for the products on your site and based on that we come up with someone will click on any of these they would directly be taken to a specific page with this filter.
rep,so that's and the second part this is the popular product section so what we're doing is you know we are also integrating our analytics onto your website so it's just that placement like how you must be using google analytics it's pretty primitive ah so once we do that we start getting in the data like you know the product clicks the actor carts and the orders coming on to the site and based on that we calculate the popularity score for each of these products so hasn't how you start typing in something we start showcasing the most popular products based on the specific where you can typed right .
rep,so so that's one and then you have the top queries now this is again your real-time analytics data based on you know what are the tops of space on the side and then we have the keyword suggestion and this is something we configure from the back end again these are some of our best practices on how we see users would be coming onto your site to make these search query so.
rep,well these can be implemented in different layouts and i will get my design team to you know come up with a couple of layouts for you as well but just you have an idea it could be a two-sided or suggests it could be a one box or a suggest you can change the way these things are shown and so on so let me know if you have anything specific you may have already discussed with model or anything you want us to know before we come up with a design .
prospect,okay yeah i mean the only the only thing i would say just looking at the different options there is we probably don't want anything popping off to the right of the search box so that first the upper left option that would go off the page at this point or even go outside of the normal view.
prospect,so maybe the body you know if we were gonna have that the extra the top queries and keyword suggestions then the bottom right option would probably fit better with our page.
rep,either we go with this or you could just have one box auto suggest.
rep,so the categories and then maybe show in the top searches and the keyboard suggestions or just reorder them to show the top queries first so.
prospect,yeah i kinda i think that bottom left that's somewhat  what we have now so in terms of the way it looks so that might be the best option for now because it's gonna be familiar to our users.
rep,okay so this will this be started with a single box autosuggest and of course while you are doing this implementation if you think you know you just want to see how it looks for the two-sided or suggests it's a very quick configuration <> anyway so we can do that.
rep,okay great.
rep,okay and do you have a responsive site or a dedicated template for mobile.
prospect,do we have a what site now.
rep,oh a responsive site or do you have a .
prospect,there's a separate it's a dedicated mobile site.
rep,so you have a dedicated mobile site alright .
prospect,if it would help  you know when we're done i i can send you a link directly to the mobile site.
rep,that'll be great.
prospect,you can pull it up on that what.
rep,hat yeah that'll be great i think that would you know just so then we can refer to it and make sure because we will have to our scripts were accordingly.
rep,great with right all right and i'm assuming you must be using google analytics at your end to keep a check on the analytics tracking or is there something else .
prospect,yes we used to plant likes .
prospect,absolutely i i also have theirs now you're not going to see a whole lot of history of the site search information in google analytics because we've only been able to track it through there for about a month or so but i do have maybe a month or two months more of data that's just in a just a file that i can send to you.
rep,that'd be great if you can just email that to me i'll just make a note of .
rep,that okay// yeah// okay and is this an in-house site search or do you have any third-party <> <> <>.
prospect,it so we have there's a third party who specializes in just this type of e-commerce platform i he has a lot of experience with this specific platform and he's the one that's who developed the site search that we have now .
prospect,so it's not it's not the one that's built in but it's still there's a lot of limitations with with our e-commerce platform so the site search still is just plain text search through product information .
rep,i see okay so my next set of questions is going to be specifically on the search page so let me just quickly go there so what i just understand is how should the layout for our search results page be so even though you being in ajax implementation we just wanna make sure this part is actually taken care of i unboxd and we get the designs .
rep,so let me just quick also move on to a category page i just want to make sure you can compare how both the pages look right now right now.
prospect,so that on the left there where it says refine results you'll notice here on this category page it doesn't show up there and that's because we don't have any attributes set for these products yet.
rep,okay okay do i go to any other page right now or do we just click on any one of these.
prospect,you can click on any one of them .
rep,okay all right so okay and you actually have search running running on these husband on your category pages.
prospect,that's that's how its implemented with the e-commerce system essentially it's it creates a custom search results page when you get to this level so you go through categories and then this type of page you're looking at right now they call a master category page.
prospect,so essentially these are all the same product but just in different sizes or different colours or in some cases we may put two or three products that all go together on one of these pages what it's doing is it's basically showing customized search results of specific items with that picture in the description up at the top.
rep,okay so one quick question on this building when we are replacing your current site search would you also be expecting us to powering each pages.
rep,i don't think so no i think we should probably leave that the way it is because that's all this page that you're looking at this type of page is the content there is dictated by our back-end system so i'm not sure if we would be able to replace it plus it's already set up.
rep,that's exactly what my concern i just want to make sure that we are clear.
prospect,yeah yeah i would leave those.
prospect,okay so i just go back to this page for now now quick few questions here so i do see that you're currently just doing a list view what do you want us to come up with a grid view as well so that the user actually has a choice between how they want to see the results or you just want to come and say /// i'm not sure i mean i've seen a couple different ways that you've implanted it before so i think in terms of the way it looks if we can keep it somewhat similar to the look that we have now.
prospect,but you know if there's the extra functionality we can add in and that would be great too.
rep,i would suggest yes what we can do is we can divide you both the list as well as the grid view because what we've seen generally is the people like to view these products in a grid view specifically in.
rep,still so give me both the options if you don't like it of course you don't have to keep it or you can have one of them set as the default and give the option.
rep,and user to actually select one of the views so that they can.
prospect,you know do you have a screenshot or an example or something of what the to look like .
rep,oh yeah just let me quickly see back into one for you you see this.
rep,and you have the option here you can now also look at in list view.
prospect,yeah actually i like that that one <> the way that you showed it there starting with here is you and then giving them the option to switch i think that makes sense.
rep,okay great so let me just make a note of that okay and yes so you are doing so you want to keep the same pagination right the way you're doing right now instead of doing an infinite scroll i think.
prospect,i'm actually i yeah i wouldn't i think i'm not sure what how do you normally implement it because it an infinite scroll might make more sense.
rep,a lot of times a lot of people are actually going for an infinite scroll at this point of time so .
rep,because if you want to do that <> .
prospect,yeah i think that i would be a good step at this point i know looking towards the future we are probably in a year or more we're going to be switching over to a responsive site and so i think that having the infinite scroll kind of gets us closer to that okay whether the you know cuz i'm on the mobile site it is an infinite scroll there's not pagination like that so i think that gets a little closer to the the one unified experience.
rep,gotcha so yeah we will go forward let's go in there alright okay and besides that so the layout for how it will be with a grid view is something that we will come up with so that's something i think it would be around standard for products over here but that's something you will come up with then we come up with the design for the grid view so .
rep,and so as part of unlock search we also provide a spell check now you know so if someone is typing in something wrong we actually will still you know show an error message and say did you mean with the respective quick now is there a specific standard messaging that you would want us to come with or is the standard did you mean fine.
prospect,i think standard is fine .
rep,okay okay and maybe i ought to show you one more thing i think you already must be having a few sort options alright so so if here if you just see this so by default we can also provide some specific sort options now it could be based on relevancy or it could be based on price or it could be based on some custom attributes based on your product catalogue so and this is something you should definitely be adding but i just want to understand which would be some of these custom fields that you would want us to add this feature so as an example it could be relevance which is something we give by default it could be price  it could be new arrivals and any other field custom field that you like.
prospect,ok so as far as the the new arrivals how would that be satisfied is that something i have to note in my uploads.
rep,yes if there is something like either a time stamp or something like that but just denotes that this product you know is a new arrival based on that.
prospect,okay yeah i'd be interested in looking at that i i think i just have to see how time intensive it is for me to add that to the upload file.
rep,so let's do this we'll start off with relevancy price and i'll just review your feed and then let you know if there's something else we found which could be used as thought option.
rep,and are you using any kind of overlays or badges as we call for doing if any products that's a new arrivals are up stock.
prospect,no we don't we don't currently do that i don't think we have the ability to.
rep,something like this like how you see here.
prospect,yeah we we don't have the ability to do that.
rep,okay but is there any attribute coming in the product catalogue that tells us if a product is on sale or is out of stock or.
prospect,not currently no.
rep,all right so what we can do is for now we leave it as is but just wanted you to know that we can provide these on our search pages.
rep,as we get this information in the product catalogue.
prospect,okay great that may be something we're adding sometime next year but at this point we don't don't have.
rep,and another quick thing so each of these products do you actually have variants for them i'm sure you have variants and sizes all the variants in colour  as well or is it just excited.
prospect,yeah it depends on the product some are colouring in size the only problem is the way that they're set up right now there's no connection between the different very variations so our system doesn't know if you look at that that screen right there you see the second and the third result the search results page are the same item they're just two different sizes so the one is the 2x one is the - 3 x our system does not understand that those are the same item.
rep,okay so you know once we actually have a look at your feed atleast for the search results we may be able to group these together.
prospect,okay yeah i mean it and there are some rules that we use as far as the item id number that you may be able to use to get that grouped.
rep,yeah because it looks like for example you know cor mp 400 - x and then this is 3 x + 4 x and they do have the same names maybe we can be.
rep,they doing alright so in case we were able to group these products together do you think it's ok to just for one primary product and you know just take them to the product description page and they can then choose the right product from there or do they actually have separate atp's as well.
prospect,well if you look okay so you click on that you're going to get just that size but the link.
prospect,i'll see you here if you go back to the search results .yeah it's just it's a separate page if you go back to the search results though
rep,oh so what it's doing is when i just click on that it's just basically giving me this information is there anything yes i should be looking at what if i click on this
rep,yeah and that that is available from a search results page as well.   so that that link you just clicked there if that's that's what i've seen that the master product category number we so this with one of the other ones so this page shows all the different sizes that currently that is something that's returned in the search search results
rep,okay i got this may be it may not be a good idea to group them together right now because also allow them to add to cart' directly from the search page itself so.// right right// .so okay but we'll just have a look just to review okay and besides that he wants to keep most of the layout same right so.
prospect,yes <priceless family>  yep.
rep,so no striking off the prices in case of discounts.
prospect,hmm no i don't think you need to do that they typically the only time there would be a discount is we do have a promo code but that has to be entered on the shopping cart page so they wouldn't typically see it as their browsing through the site .
rep,okay and how do you want us to treat the out of stock products what do you do at this point of time do you do demote them.
prospect,right now we don't really do anything that we try to keep them off the website all together actually but i think that's something i probably would just manually demote once we get the system up and running.
rep,okay because on the search pages we can demote them okay.
prospect,okay yeah.
rep,okay so i think that's about it okay.
rep,i'm sorry so anything anything you're side .
rep,no i don't think so the only question i have is whether and this is something obviously as you guys look through it and kind of discover what it's going to require i'm wondering if there's a way for for us to include both the product page and also that master category page in the search results so right now if you look at that the second result there the 2x cover all the link that's above the image takes you just to that size but the link that's right below the image takes you to the page with all the sizes .
rep,great okay.
prospect,so i'd like to have both of those links showing up in the search results if we can do that.
prospect,and i can when when as far as to get the data to i can get you a list of the i believe i can of each of those category names and the items that that fall into.
prospect,perfect yeah i think once we have that data it should be pretty straightforward for us .
rep,okay anything else.
prospect,okay no i don't i think that's it we did i did talk a little bit earlier on about indexing the non product pages as well .
prospect,because right now those are not included in our site search so if you scroll up to the top of the page everything under the about us tab and the services tab and even the blogs none of that is indexed by the search right now.
rep,okay and that's something that you would want us to do as well.
prospect,i'd like to somehow be able to handle it yeah i think we talked about either just including it in the search index or.
rep,redirects.
prospect,or yeah the yeah i was going to say the other option i think was a redirect so for locations for instance if system types in locations or something that makes clearly indicates they're trying to find out where we are i want them to find that page.
rep,okay i think we can look at doing redirects as the first option why we still figure out how else to put that data in the product catalogue i think this will be right way to.
prospect,okay and those those pages do not change very often so<><>.
rep,okay quick thing i didn't forget to ask you one so do you barely have any reviews for these products as well or.
prospect,no we don't we don't currently have it.
rep,okay and i didn't see one more thing that when you actually select any of these filters there aren't really any tags that are shown on the filters that were applied so let me just give you an example of that just just so you know how we would be implementing this.
rep,so when you select any of these<><>.
rep,so that's something we would be adding by default.
prospect,okay yeah all right.
rep,and yeah i guess that's about it from my end and what we do as next step i will share the ftp details with you so that you can share a sample for our catalog we just go through it review it and give us a couple of days and we will get back to you on the timelines of this implementation.
rep,okay yep and apart from this i've attended some of the other action items like getting in the data for your analytics from the past one to two months.
rep,i will share all this.
rep,okay oh great.
rep,great thanks so much for your time jaison i'm dropping an email shortly all right thank you.
rep,excuse me jason.
prospect,thank you yes yeah.
rep,hi jason this is rohit here thank you ridhima for this first of all and secondly just want to check if you had a chance to go through the the agreement that we sent out last week not sure you.
prospect,no i haven't i don't think i did anything with it yet i think it was maybe came my last day of work last week so i'm going through all my emails today but yeah i will make sure we take care of that when i'm trying to remember now from last week what what did we say when when do we mean to get that back.
rep,- uh it was the same it was on the same email thread you know when in bed and you responded for this implementation call let me just have a quick .
prospect,all right yeah i will make sure we take care of that today then.
rep,perfect just wanted to check your check it out with you know it would definitely look good on my numbers being <demanded> .
rep,all right perfect do let me know if you do have any questions though you know regarding the information that we shared<> .
rep,okay yeah i haven't had a chance to look at it yet but um i will review it when we're done here and then i can let you know if there's any questions or anything .
rep,that sounds good thank you so much for the help jason .
rep,poor or can i just get started on the discussion.
rep,i believe can start the discussion got it  ridhima.
rep,okay don't i know that we kind of connected around six to seven months back on the implementation so and i know that you guys are on shopify and we've been through the whole process of filling in the implementation piece you know the form and all of that earlier as well so what i do is i don't think we probably need to go through that you know completely all over again but maybe just do a quick recap so nimesh can you just make me the present i am going to share my screen .
rep,oh sure just give me a second.
rep,jones are you able to see the screen.
prospect,yes yes i'm looking at it now.
rep,oh so so currently what would you want us to start the implementation with is it gonna be search and recommendations or is it just gonna be search.
prospect,it's gonna be both.
rep,okay all right and i know that you're on shopify and you sent some details of how to install the plug-in but i just resend those to you so basically all you need to do at your end is install our shopify i plug in and then give us the access to one of the tests themes at your end or you just give us the access to the theme section and then unboxd will go ahead and create a copy of your current life theme and go ahead and make all the changes there in the test theme for everyone to preview and you know once everyone is fine to those we'll go ahead and push those tonight so that's for that but how would you want us to do the search because now my guests see and this currently when you click on search do you want to keep the same design when someone starts typing in you want the autosuggest to start coming in as a drop down here itself or how do you .
prospect,actually i would like a bar i think that just provides better without changing screens or so probably a bar and i got to figure out it's just above or just below the current menu bar 
 so i was looking at pure <> bracelet today with my marketing team and we were just kind of reviewing some of those questions and i don't know that we're decided but i definitely want a bar on the home screen .
rep,yeah because that's kind of a little better experience because sometimes when you just you don't know you're clicking and going here people don't know and sometimes you just see a pop up and then they just land up closing it anyways so yeah if you know you can let us know what kind of a design you're looking at is that something someone at your team will already design and give to us or if you need any ideas from us let us know and we can work around those as well .
prospect,oh so basically you need i'm gonna a list of these items that you need for me so i'm clear so i'm going right now through a new theme a couple so i have a test theme that we've been playing with and i have a designer who does all these all of our theme tweaks and so that i guess my question is i would need to know exactly what you what you need it for me and what you need it what you were gonna do if i was gonna do so we got that perfectly situation.
rep,right so so what we need from you is you know basically a final design of how you how you want to do the search box and if there's someone in your team who will already be making that change then i would like to go ahead and make the unboxd changes on top of that test theme itself you know where all the other changes are happening because this is something which is not happening on a single page this is happening on across the site so we got to make sure that you know it's completely in sync with how you want the design to be so.
prospect,so basically my designer create the bar you could just then take that and then go from there.
prospect,okay i can do that .
rep,okay that's one and besides that okay let's see now if i search something so currently when i'm searching for the products this is how we are getting those and let's say i am on one of your category pages so we'll keep the listings very similar to how your category pages look is that okay or do you want to do something very specific here as well .
prospect,no i like it this is one thing i really want to have on our search.
prospect,so looking more like this .
rep,and on the left-hand side i see that you're displaying the complete category section all the collections can we do this that we sim provide you the collections but you probably keep it collapsible as well so that people can actually look at more of the facets that you have on the left-hand side which are going to be multi select arranged .
rep,yeah yeah .
rep,yeah so that's one and of course apart from this we will be providing you a spell check that will automatically show you the right set of results even if someone types and/or miss types of query so all that will be taken and.
rep,are you using any recommendations currently.
prospect,i am if you go to a product page so click on those t-shirts below the fold .
rep,this one right yeah okay so you'd want us to keep a similar design for all the widgets that we give.
rep,ok so i just quickly make a note of these things in my phone just to be sure and what i do is i will also be sending you a few designs for the autosuggest so that you can just quickly go through them and let me know if there's any specific design that you like and we'll go ahead and implement that specific designer and i know i shared those in the past with you but i just resend them to you just so beginning a refresher on what design would suit the site the best and i think once we design for the search bar it's gonna be a lot easier for us to then go ahead and make the auto suggest design based on that .
rep,and i'll send you a few of those again you currently have a responsive site i'm assuming for mobile.
prospect,yes correct.
rep,and i'll will also require access to your google analytics because that just helps us in you know keeping a check on what our top search queries and making sure we can trigger some of this data based on that so if you can also provide us read-only access for a couple of email ids i can share those with you .
rep,okay so a few specific things within the search itself for pagination let me just see how you're doing it currently would you want to stick to an infinite scroll or the pagination of products when you're on search listing listing page.
prospect,yeah no right now we do by pages with you yeah i don't know how many rows that are i have to look i think like five or six rows .
rep,six looks like that around yeah twelve rows okay.
prospect,twelve rows yeah.
prospect,so on search you can do infinite scroll.
rep,yeah we can do infant scroll.
prospect,for yeah i like that i mean that's always better than having to like press next and then i think that's a more dynamic experience.
rep,yeah yeah it's more engaging for the user so alright so i'm stick with that same as category pages so we just discussed a few of these and i'm just making a note okay so .
rep,what kind of a messaging would you want for the spell check just a standard did you mean or do you have something more specific in mind.
prospect,no that sounds good.
rep,okay and i don't i don't think that there are any sort options that we give so by default we can provide you some specific sort options for example it could be sort by price it could be sort by discount and it could be you know sort on best sellers are then specific attributes that you would want to put the sort on let me see.
prospect,no no when i look at i don't think there's any specific i mean obviously by the attributes of size colour size colour price all the attributes is i don't think i have anything generic or anything specific .
rep,okay so do we just stick to relevance and price for now or you also want to add anything else i mean these are for example these are some of the different sort options we give it could be price.
prospect,i like relevance i like price and i do like new arrivals because we do that's a big deal and bring in new arrivals/.
rep,okay and i guess the details for a product of being in new arrivals should be easily something we can pull in directly from shopify .
prospect,yeah we have in a specific cat collection while they're listed as a new item and then what they removed from that but no longer considered a new item.
rep,got you. so for example you see here one of these sites you can you know you provide these different sort options what we also provide them is multi select filters there you can expand or collapse them and then as and how you select any of these you start seeing some asset tags coming to me.
prospect,i do like popularity actually i think that provides.
rep,yeah okay then we make out of that.
rep,and so these are how the facet tags will be as and how you keep doing a multi-select you can start seeing in what are those filters that users are actually clicking on and then you can go ahead and either just close any one of them or just feel all of them and that's something that we would be implementing as well .
rep,i didn't specific overlays that you show right now i don't see one on force in one of these leggings is there anything else any other labels that you may be having something when you are and .
prospect,i love the new arrival once again i think that's a great a great one just because we are constantly adding new products and the people who search that i want to sold out should be there .
rep,so do you want to show some other products in your search results or do you wanna hide them if you want to show them what we can do is we can always demote them to the bottom of the search results .
prospect,so i think the demoted would be good .
rep,and we can come up with something specific and you know wade on how you can have a message saying sold out and you didn't see for yourself and you know of course you want to make any changes to it we can go and do that as well but while you're implementing this and test i would suggest adding this overlay as well.
rep,okay i do see only one price here would you be having places where both the prices are shown the discounted price and the.
prospect,well you go to a sell item go to sell item it shows it .
rep,yeah okay we make it the same and do you have variants these products are are all of them individual unique products .
prospect,no we do have variants so this isn't a great thing to look at for variants because the variants are just sizes small medium large extra-large but on a lot of different colors a lot of different other like jewelry there are multiple colors within a variant.
rep,okay let me just go through section .
prospect,let's see go to the i'm not overly familiar with all of our skus try that aurora stone yeah exactly see if that one should have some different colors there's one thing i'm worried about is our colors are pretty so there's black so the color there but sometimes we do some off colors like rust or seafoam and so i want to make sure that we don't have like a you guys are putting like a color sample i think the name should be they're not like a little what i'm looking for a little palette.
prospect,little swatch that's where before because when we tried that before swatches it didn't recognize 50% of our colors and it just was a complete failure.
rep,so what do you want ue to put smaller thumbnails of these images or what do you suggest how do we go.
prospect,i would say you just list the attribute colour so like if you click on that on the colour drop-down box i think those are the values that it that it provides are we talking the same thing .
rep,yes i saw just john them oh i think what john is saying just list the text of the color so it says black say black and sort of the image of the swatch color image so if it says rust just say rust the text of text that says rust.
rep,yeah but it's just what a make it big crowded if we try putting in the text there it's we have to think about this because it will require some design changes on how the listing page would be so.
prospect,i do have a concerned about it i don't think there's any way that in a swatch setup that you guys will ever be able to match our colors and i don't know that we want that either.
rep,we can.
rep,are you talking about the facet we're talking about the facet right.
rep,okay we can do that what what i was talking about john was showing the variants watches here itself on the product so.
rep,so to show the science yeah i am on yeah john just give me a minute let me just show you an example here for example this the specific product is available in different metal types and we actually show them a smaller thumbnails just so that the user knows that this is actually available in different colors so although you'll still list those we can list those and colors directly as text instead of swatches but we can also show some smaller images for each one of them while you're on the listing.
prospect,okay i mean i guess my concern is like on that aurora stone dangle hearing on my page if i have six seven or eight of them is that gonna be crowded down there.
rep,right right that's something we never check or maybe we just show two three more or maybe just throw in an overlay or a small message that says you know available in different colors maybe something like that.
prospect,yeah i mean we've struggled with that ourselves we used to do a little hash tag that would or a little description thing available more colors because we weren't able to show the more colors we wanted people to know that i mean what if we said we displayed up to four or five colors anything more than that meaning it's okay they capped at four or five whatever whatever works the right way and then we just assume they're gonna click on it if they want to see the more colors .
rep,yeah we can do that you can just display four results or yeah three or four of them and depending on we will go through the designs i you know go and discuss this with my designer and see maybe i think we can do for so four should be .
rep,and you on the left-hand side you will see the filter and we do that using the text instead of using the color swatches.
rep,and for the out of stock products we will demote them to the bottom of the pages and since we will be giving an infinite scroll as on how you'll keep scrolling through the results they will be adding a back to top button and let me see if you already have that one so you don't have that so many someone is scrolling through these infinite number of results here we'll also be having a back to top button just so that when they click on it they can go back to the top of the page let me see if i can show you and it's something like this you see this .
prospect,yeah that's great
rep,so something like that alright and so we will have to go through your feed to understand what could view different fields on which we can create the facets and the filters but are there any specific important fields that you think we should be creating these filters on so that i can make a note of this here itself <>.
prospect,oh i felt yeah color size.
rep,category.
prospect,category yeah those are those i mean i think any attribute yet price it has to be that we have list of you have access to me nuts.
prospect,i don't know i don't think i don't see a very big custom ones that we really need.
rep,okay okay got it and for the price facet would you want it like a slider or something like a price range.
prospect,well so this one has both right.
rep,i'm sorry i didn't get that.
prospect,the one we're looking at has both yeah generally people like to have any one of them but let me know if you want both of them we can add both as well .
prospect,but can you take me to and i'll pull up in my the pure vita bracelet i just i like the cleanliness of there's a long.
prospect,so i'm looking at how theirs is right now.
rep,right filter on there's.
rep,the other reason for that is a lot of the products are absolutely similarly prized on their site so so these are their colours filters these are the metal charm and category so they don't do a price filter up so what do you do is for now if you want we can just you know in the test theme just to create a range filter for prices and then you know you'd see how that's looking and if required we make changes based on that.
prospect,okay can you block anything that less than a dollar or like a specific price range.
rep,okay you don't want to show that in the filters itself the same .
rep,yeah we can do that.
prospect,well yeah i sometimes we do like upsells and they're in hidden collections or not they're not hitting collections but there's some different collections that don't go up and i want to make sure in the search they don't show up.
rep,ya we can do that.
prospect,we're gonna include a collection from being in the search.
rep,yeah we can do that absolutely so we just need to know from you you know the flags are the values of specific attributes based on which we need to filter these out and once that's done it's pretty easy to set up a filter directly from our unboxers dashboard itself so that's something actually do and do you have any kind of product ratings that you would want to display or something like those review stars that you see on sites or is that something you'd want to meet up.
prospect,why already yet something i'm working on in my 2016 plans.
rep,okay so as a now you add those we can obviously add those search on search result pages as well so that's one and i'm assuming you would also want the school search to be enabled which essentially is you know if someone searches directly by the product id you would still wanna make sure we are able to show the right result.
prospect,sure i know i don't we don't get much of that but sure i don't see why all .
rep,right okay now obviously since you have a mobile insight all of that will be taken care of inherently when we do this implementation for desktop as well so that part will be taken care off and as i said i will share these autosuggest designs with you so that we can just you know go through them and let me know which are the ones that you like for the recommendations i just want to understand which ones would you like to start off with initially so if you want i can just give you a quick list of the ones that we generally recommend to start off with and once we've captured analytics data for around 10 to 12 days that's when you can start putting in some of the other recommendation widgets as well.
prospect,<<>>.
rep,okay so on the home page we generally go with recently viewed and the top sentence now obviously in the beginning we will not have any top set of data coming in from your end but going through your geo data we know what our top four or five top-selling products and as on how we go live but the next couple of days if we actually start throwing in the top sellers based on the real-time analytics data that unbox captures so these are the two that go on to the homepage and you can go for well more like this on the product description pages because this lets do you know show some of the other similar items from the specific categories and subcategories that people may want to buy so this is this goes on your pdp and later on once we have enough data we can pick up one of these two widgets on the product description pages as well we've also viewed all the bottles you bought which takes into account some of the other similar users with very similar click history and buying history animation that we try and recommend products that those are the users have been buying on the side so these can all be done in a phase two and then you have the recommended for you now this is personalized for every user i would suggest you to put this on the zero result page you know whenever someone is coming onto the side and for some reason they are not able to find any results for a search query instead of redirecting them to a blank page we actually take them to a page where they can actually see these recommendations were personalised for them vision what they have been clicking on and in case it's a new user we try and show those products which are trending on your site at any one point so so these are the ones i would suggest starting off with and in due course we can then go ahead and add the cart recommendations and a view also of viewed or a bought also bought on the product of description pages.
prospect,okay the only thing that from historical data with our current recommendations provider we found the home page recommendations to be very poor performance and so we actually removed them off our home page and we manage our own home page recommendations via our own collection that we customised for that .
rep,got you okay.
prospect,not performing at a nominal it was pretty very little value .
rep,okay and when you're doing it in house clinically is there a specific logic that you guys are following on.
prospect,no it's a collection it's the featured collection that whatever we add to that shows up there.
rep,okay alright so so what you just want to uh maybe just keep the featured one and here itself and below this maybe just add a recently viewed or something or you think.
prospect,keep the page too busy you know i like right the other recently viewed i guess and i think about it i with that with search i could remove that that left column of the collections i can go a little bit wider and then i could you know for that would give you a room to do almost five featured items and then below it five recently viewed or top sellers.
rep,yeah yeah so yeah maybe you can just think about it and see if you need to make any design changes and then we can go and map those otherwise get started with the product description pages and add the first widget there so .
rep,okay this seems to be vertical for me right now.
prospect,i don't know what's going on there that's weird seems like it went like.
prospect,really pleased with the formatting of of my current recommendations so they just it makes the image a little smaller and it doesn't quite i don't feel like it's as quite as attractive as it potentially could be see all that wasted space below where you have a price and you have the button and the picture of the product is smaller i almost want the inverse where the picture is bigger the text is smaller or even you know i don't know if if price is maybe something we skip i don't know.
rep,okay so let me know one thing i'm just probably but so when i'm sharing these designs for the autosuggest i can also just share a couple of designs for how the recommendations could look maybe you can just go through that and you know we make the custom templates based on that.
rep,let me just make them note of it okay so yeah i guess so these are the only questions through my and let me know if you have any other questions for me.
prospect,i think we've talked about it enough i think i have a good understanding of where we're going and what can you do until i feel good about it.
rep,alright thank you.
rep,you just published just to add in a thanks for them john just to quickly add in one of the other things ridhima we're also going to do is provide some sort of a timeline of when each phase of the project will complete correct.
rep,yep that's right yeah so it's just that once we get the access once we have these designs going and they have a variety of that we can obviously go ahead and we'll be sharing those details as well.
rep,correct correct so john basically once this state information is exchanged some of the details have been finalized you also want to give you an idea for the timeline looks like so that you can anticipate you know when we would need your help to make sure you are also looking at these things testing it you're happy with it and then we move it into production and again you know assistance requiring your assistance in getting into production as well so just from that perspective and also what we'll finalise is the agreement on the final set of fee and a monthly fee so you will also get to see that and once you're happy with all the details and you are okay with the agreement you sign it we'll get started on the work based on the timeline and get it done.
prospect,good to me.
rep,all right awesome well thanks sean i really appreciate your time today and with ridhima thank you so much for walking john for this as well.
rep,thank you any question john.
prospect,no i said i think i put this off long enough i just need to buckle down and do it so i appreciate your patience well and we'll look at the time .
rep,absolutely thank you so much and keeping us in mind even though it has been a long time we have absolutely see a new you stay patient with us as well with our bothering you and everything so thank you.
prospect,you're gonna be great i appreciate it thanks guys all right .
rep,thank you okay have a great day.
prospect,yeah i i think i appreciate that kind of high-level talks because i was concerned that we're you're gonna want to jump right into everything i'm like oh my gosh i don't know that i'm ready for that but like i told you previously it is a priority for 2016 i feel like i told you i'm with forktail i don't feel like the value i'm getting in return is worth what i'm spending i feel like you guys offer a better value proposition when i just compared you to foretell i'm going a politican i get search and and recommendation and so i do look at that as a great combination and so we have a lot what you're exactly right we did come up with our list of priorities we did that over just right after new year's we met together as a leadership team and we have our long list of priorities and i'll be honest with you we did search on one of them but i feel like it is part of the website experience which is what we're trying to provide a premium website experience but that's a sub kind of a detail within that and so.
rep,that's where i'm at right now.
prospect,i we are you know i'm very interested in like i told you before and so i guess i'd like to review with you guys again and there's because it has been several months and we don't need to do the whole team know kind of what exactly what you guys offer just as a review for me from implementation time and cost those three things we can do a quick review of that then i could kind of have a better just i think remember the numbers and the general i come here but that would give me better kind of just refresher and so that i alright let's do this i could put some time aside and this week this month let's get going on and let's do this.
rep,got it so let's start would be the biggest question is cost what we believe at that time you were paying around $600 to four tell if i'm not mistake right and what we were trying to come up with and say look for the traffic that you have and the catalog size that you have what we can do is for the first year we can give you the search and our recommendations solution both for 600 to show you that we have a better solution than for tell not any better value not just from the recommendations perspective but also by adding the search component to it and so that's the cost we wanted to price match to what 4chan was doing even though we are providing two sets of solutions and products you're willing to take that hit for you and make sure that you get you're not spending any more so you're not spending more to try us but then you'll be also able to see the value that you're bringing to the table so that's the cost that's the monthly cost there is a one-time fee that we proposed of $1000 which is just a setup fee to set up search setup recommendations etc and you know that's just a secondary sort of the cost please so that's number one number two was the implementation so typically the implementation takes about four to six weeks it could be as fast as four weeks because there's not a lot of back and forth and but it could be six weeks where let's say we come up with one design you don't like it you have to go back and make changes to come back with more designs etc.
rep,right and so it's typically four to six weeks is what the time frame takes it does not require a tremendous amount of effort from your team it's mostly the onus is on unboxd the only time you get involved is approving giving access approving the designs and your qa and testing pretty much everything else is done by unbox which is what the setup fee is for so that's the sort of the implementation awfully that's enough detail as far as the high level implementation time or do you want me to go okay alright and and they just take one level detail beneath that is that it's very simple you kick make a copy your current theme we implemented into that theme you tested on that theme when you're all happy you make that theme before realize and that's how you switch it into production so it's pretty straightforward .
rep,the third key or the first piece that i think that she asked is what is it that we're going to actually provide so if you look at your site and if you look at my screen and then if you can see my screen john.
prospect,i don't get ya know i have.
rep,the top and we start i'll have to stop and restart.
rep,cannon can is that your john or it can you guys make me the presenter please .
rep,me thank you that's why you didn't see the screen actually okay there we go hopefully you'll see the screen now// yeah //okay awesome so if i go to search obviously the experience is slightly different right now but let's say we want to start saying what is actually okay so let's say here's the autocomplete the type-ahead piece will come in so that's number one how the type what the type of head will look like we'll give you a couple of design options based on your style based on your fonts etc and you can pick pick and choose mix and match etc so that's what we'll take care of next would be the actual search results so today the search results obviously are not as optimized as your category pages both including the listing of the products the sorting options maybe the view options and also the filters on the left so that's what we'll we'll give you the fourth thing will be the back end merchandise so you'll get the ability to create merchandising rules or to manage your search fifth is obviously the reporting for each one of them six will be the recommendations themselves so if you have this recommendation widget will be replacing with our own and in fact we you only have one right now we'll add two recommendation widgets here then you you may or may not have certain recommendation widgets so you have a cart widget whatever the widgets that you have from four till today we'll replace those as well.
rep,and add any widgets that you also agree with in the plan say let's for example you have the featured featured ones here if you wanted to have some sort of a much more call it a top sellers or on the on the even on the product page if you wanted to have specific complete the look type widgets for that those as well okay so .
prospect,okay can you a be testing on different things like i was thinking the home page we were seeing that it wasn't performing the recommendations that foretell is doing on the home page  performing well don on the product pages there was some performance but on this home page there was a zero performance and so that's why we swapped to a static list that were like our highlights so can you guys provide us an a/b testing scenario so we got the haze yeah we're seeing it perform better or let's tweak it so now it's performing that at its best.
rep,yeah so what we can do is more rather than calling it a/b test before and after so let's say you have this white space here we can put something else here we can keep the future right here where it is you can add something here if you want to and you can see what the performance of that particular widget is over time so before the widget got added what was the performance or the click hatred was after the widget was added what was it and based on the feedback if we tuned it what's in the new hit weight and the reporting on based on that absolutely so we can do it that way because a trying to ab test absence or presence of it will require you to deploy an a/b testing tool .
prospect,okay i don't know if you guys could serve up you know depending like 50/50 one collection recommendation versus another or something like that okay i was more wondering .
rep,yeah we was just something we have added to our product road map it is something that we did something we cannot do today but it's definitely coming in our product roadmap for 2016.
rep,okay we're not only will you be able to a/b test between two different widgets you'll be also able to ab test merchandising within the widgets you'll be able to come in and say okay i'm going to merchandise this widget and i only want 50% of the traffic coming to my merchandise versus that non merchandise gets the other 50% you'll be able to do that as well.
rep,yeah okay so that's what you're going to get very high level hopefully that gives you an idea.
prospect,oh what let's go back one thing real quick go to a collection like drop down in products or scroll down to the on the left hand side and see let's see a collection so whatever i'm trying to see you guys click on the life actually the chic collection the very top one do you do any recommendations by collection or don't you have some scenario where you provide that to be a header for search things.
rep,oh so for search yes for search you're gonna have a banner just like this but this is your category page right.
prospect,yeah yeah so you want you're saying you want to have a similar banner while the search page what if everybody knew what the options were here so that i could kind of present it to my team and make sure we're on the same page .
rep,sure so if you were to let's say so this is what your search page could look like so today your search page obviously does not look like this so your search page can look like this you can have a banner up top you can you can the more things you can have you can have sorting options here let me show you something simple okay so you could have product listing in a very different way so you can have list view of you can have grid view of you you can have sorting options you'll have the filters on the left right so that's what you will have for the search page so if i now what to search for let's say sheik this is what it looks like today it can look like this structure obviously the fonts and colors and everything will be yours but it can look like the structure so can have the right images detail right images and everything for the search page .
rep,okay does that answer your question john i just want to make sure i answer your question.
prospect,yeah yeah i think we're pretty good there.
prospect,do you have can you send me i know we reviewed a powerpoint the person or one remembers phone calls yep if you have like a copy or pdf or something even send me just so i can go through and have kind of a more detailed review of everything .
rep,yeah absolutely i can send you that .
rep,okay no  problem what is the time frame john that  you're looking at this realistically.
prospect,good question um let me look my calendar real quick.
prospect,i yeah it's got march i would say here's my talk realistic time frame i got a couple projects going on in january last two weeks in january were going on vacation i get back on that basically the eighth and.
prospect,you mean february is told you man
/// yes february get back on the fifth or the sixth month of saturday so eight and then i'm pretty wide it's open i have a one before i'm out of town but i would say i like the idea of starting the process like get going on the 8th and then from a four week time frame four to six week time frame from there that's what i would like to do kind of get my all the requirements i need for you guys put together in a few weeks with what we want the next week's of them start like a implementation process like on the eighth have like a phone call or something or maybe on the knife give me a day back and then we kind of start them there that's my stop.
rep,absolutely okay so that's that works so if you if you don't mind can we do the tenth possibly if i tell if i'm perfect so we could probably at least tentatively scheduled something right now for the same time on the 10th is that open for you.
prospect,i usually meet have a scheduled recurring phone call at 10:30 on the 10th so i would say maybe like afternoon my time i know we have some different times time zones for you guys but if there were an after  eleven 30s what i really anytime after 11:30.
rep,are you eastern.
prospect,i'm mountain.
rep,oh your mountain okay so so i'm central so would you want to do 1:00 pm.
rep,your time.
prospect,1:00 pm.
rep,would work okay perfect because right now it is 10:18 for you right.
rep,and he's got okay just want to make sure because this is day light savings times really messes me up because during day light.
rep,<><><>.
rep,you guys are saying this specific daylight savings.
prospect,yaya we don't we actually are like most of civilised state so we <>.
rep,okay alright so if you're always an hour behind me so that's perfect so 1:00 p.
rep,m.
rep,mountain time which would be 2 p.
rep,central on february the 10th so what we can do john is in the meantime i'll send you the the deck so you can talk about it internally also send you an agreement that outlines the price that we talked about etc so you can see exactly what we're gonna do and we can also set up we can also request a couple of pieces if you don't mind i mean i'm assuming you use google analytics today right so if you don't mind giving us a read-only access to your google analytics once you are in agreement that you want to move forward okay you don't have to do that until then so and also give us access to one of your themes if you can make a copy of the production theme and then give us access to that so we can actually see what the catalog looks like all that so we can do some of the homework and the legwork up front we can go on the 10:00 schedule an implementation call outline what exactly what you're gonna do what you're gonna do you sign the agreement before that after that how are you feel comfortable and once we provide the timelines to you you sign off on it we'll get started.
rep,okay does that sound fair sound like a plan .
rep,awesome so let me send you the presentation also send you the nsa and let me know if you have any questions and then we can absolutely go from there now the two things what i'll do is it's a more likely high level overview of the individual features that we are providing so you can actually see what this would look like i want to make sure i add some of the new elements since the last time we presented that to you what is it can you give me like a couple of days to just finalise that make it pretty before i send it to you.
prospect,yeah totally fine okay totally by time you know i have a lot of things going on this week so i probably won't even really touch it this week and b next week that i have some time and it kind of hurt for you that so .
rep,yeah this gives me perfect timing because we've added so many things over the holiday period because we have it down delivered on time in terms of integrations so i want to make sure that don't get added and also look pretty so not just engineering language so thank you for that for the end of this week i'll send that to you and if you if you want us to schedule one more demo call for your bigger team john don't hesitate to say so i love to do these demos i love to have these types of conversations so i'm more than happy to do that as well and i can very quickly walk them through within 30 minutes exactly what we're going to do and what's gonna look like so they can also see if you want them to see firsthand what this will look like rather than taking a whole hour i can do that also as an offer if you need to .
prospect,yeah i make a gif on that because i he won't want to make sure that the marketing team is fully on board and they you know they can give me their feedback on what they want because you know they i can put them in charges you know they're in charge of the look and build a website so i if i wanted to do something without their input.
rep,absolutely so that's perfect would you have any preference to set up this call maybe we can just do that sometime next week since you're busy this week.
prospect,let me let me tell them they have a big trade show i may have you guys do it while i'm out of town they have a big trade show next week that they're gonna be really slammed on preparing for and then sometimes on the 25th through this january to the 6th of february i may have you guys work out a schedule once they're done with the trade show i may be out of town but i'll have you get on with them so they can kind of understand what's going on.
rep,is this trade show your trade show or is it like nrf.
prospect,it's an influence trade show where it's more like a conference than a trade show i should say where we had a lot of big influencers show up and we talked about our brand and how to partner with us to promote our product potential .
rep,but it's more like the apparel world trade show not a retail world it's not like the and rf that's happening in new york next week .
prospect,no no .
rep,okay cuz i'm at nrf so i thought maybe if they are coming channel maybe i can set something up there but that's not the case okay.
rep,no problem alright so that works i'm assuming you at some point introduce us to them and we'll work with them to come up with the schedule .
prospect,yeah i talked about this week and then give a heads up what's going on and then what case we can we can email over the next few weeks and i can introduction then you can schedule something directly with them and their team but let's look to communicate every email get that take care.
rep,absolute perfect so if you don't hear back from you john say that's the end of this week should we reach out to you again early next week just to just check-in to make sure what you want us do as next steps is that a good time frame or good okay awesome.
rep,all right awesome and anything else john that you have a question on that i did not answer .
prospect,no i think we're good .
rep,okay all right awesome oh i didn't want to ask you one more thing john would it be possible i'm assuming you might have created certain rules within the four cell solution is it possible for you to give us access to the full shell solution as well so that we can make sure those will be copied over to our system as well .
prospect,yeah i think once we sign an agreement i wouldn't have an issue with that like i need to talk with four tails well and have that conversation and that's totally fine.
rep,sure well obviously don't tell them you're sharing the login that might get them upset and.
prospect,no no i my rules are pretty simple they're not over the complicated so it's fine .
rep,okay got it okay that's perfect any we don't need access if you feel uncomfortable doing there being it you just need the rules we thought if you give us access we can copy them ourselves but if you're gonna give a screenshot or just tell us what they are we can do that as well you know what. okay okay awesome anything else john from my side .
prospect,no i did a good
rep,perfect okay so next steps i'll send send out the presentation to you and the nsa and we'll schedule a call with your marketing team and then we'll just go from there .
prospect,okay appreciate it .
rep,no thank you thank you john so quickly getting back to us and giving us the time in the new year i know you're busy so i really appreciate it .
prospect,all right thank you have a good .
rep,we'll talk soon all right talk soon thanks john.
rep,have the ridhima who is our implementation expert and she and i spend a little bit of time looking at your catalogue and we also looked at some other shopify elements so we wanted to make sure that at the very least today we can answer two questions for you one was the storefront shopify installation that you've done and you can install our app the catalogue that it exists as of today what state is it in and ridhima will be able to show you what data points that you get today and what is possible yes go ahead.
prospect,so sorry interrupt that.
rep,that's ok.
prospect,the shopify catalogue that we have today is incomplete.
rep,cool.
prospect,i also i also should let you know that based on our last conversation kind of about shopify being a good for 0 to 5 million business and for scaling up we've been in conversations started conversations with big commerce volusion and magento.
prospect,magento is cost prohibitive and we weren't really impressed by volusion but big commerce and as they showed us kind of the intricacies of the you know us patriot tactical seems to be kind of everybody's golden trails for you guys and for an e-commerce.
rep,yeah thats funny.
prospect,yeah there it's there um one of their case studies.
prospect,and i my space is great and they they i guess like.
rep,they've done a good job.
prospect,yeah but talking a big commerce i think that while if we can walk down kind of how it works on shopify especially we have the account rep from from big commerce walk us through faceted search that's like a built-in big commerce out-of-the-box feature and i think that combining just looking at what shopify their features list and also their documentation compared to what big commerce has to offer.
prospect,things like bigcommerce might be a better fit for us and wanted your and i know that now we have a shot by expert on the line but wanted your take on that as well in the context of unbox and the context of product search because i've found that you know search results tend to be a little more vibrant on bigcommerce the the faceted search out of the box is i mean a huge plus for us also the whole thing with the columns that you mentioned you know finding the different product attributes.
prospect,is a lot more flexible with bigcommerce and with shopify so me i mean this would be good to talk to a child expert day because get an idea of the possibilities and limitations of the shopify platform in depth.
rep,got it's so good news is ridhima has actually worked on shopify and bigcommerce so she also was a person who did the integration with us patriot and and we have a couple of other bigcommerce customers also.
prospect,correct ridhima.
rep,that's right hai polen so in fact i've worked with the us patriot on the bigcommerce implementation i also worked with a lot different customers on shopify so maybe we can just you know walk you through what are the things that you can currently achieve even within shopify to start off with and then we can probably discuss with you folks.
rep,monal you were saying something is there anything else or .
rep,no i just wanted to here the two parts a column that we had prepared was one was we understood that the storefront catalogue was incomplete but at least from the structure perspective you wanted to give you an idea that what does it need to look like for us to be able to provide the faceting for you and which may also necessarily be true for bigcommerce by the way so that step may still have to be done the second part is and how we can help you with that the second part was we actually found some articles on shopify to walk you through to say once we do this exercise for you from processing your catalog and building up the attribute columns how you can take that and put it into the shopify app to make the faceted navigation possible so as i said faceted search faceted i'm sorry and the other piece last piece i just want to add is while bigcommerce search may seem out of the box there's a lot of limitations around how it actually behaves which is what us patriot actually wanted to use somebody for this particular function because out of the box it's not very not very intuitive it makes it a naked enables it but the look and feel a lot of the other functionality are still very limited in that sense which is not necessarily any e-commerce platform strength by the way you goes with magento you go to bigcommerce you go to atg everybody out of the box is pretty if they're the more they have the breath right they don't have the depth in a particular vertical which is why we've atg you have products like endeca or with ibm web commerce you have products like unbox again there or with big commerce so let us walk you through the shopify piece and then if it is the same thing as possible in becomes at least you now know so if there are other benefits to the commerce that you are more interested in that doesn't have anything to do with unbox you can make that independent choice and know that no matter what direction you go what's available and what's not.
rep,all right awesome.
rep,go ahead ridhima.
rep,based on the feed that we are getting in from you at this point of time i think the data that bit just getting in is the category which is not available for all the products we are getting the product type information for each of these products and apart from that we're getting in a lot of time now i'm sure this must be a lot of manual mapping done for each of these specific products but at this point of time if you look at this data then even when we are providing you a fast navigation something like her or probably us patriot it has at this point of time there are a lot of different elements if you would have to work on well there can be a way in which unlocks can stop being of data from the tags that you have just to come up with products now it would just be based on the fact that you want to show gold pins and silver pins and bronze pins or it could just be the occasion for which a specific pin would be used so depending on this data and if you have a standard set of values let's say you have come up with 10 to be values at your data needs to be segregated into then unlocks can definitely go back and we can write some scripts and make sure that we've actually segregated in and segmented your data in that specific way now while still an <> on our end or within the product catalog and unboxed n what we've seen is in shopify we can then go back and upload the same data for the products that you have or by using some of the shopify api so i can you know send them the details for that in an email to you but let's say i go ahead and populate 5 or 6 custom fields here all that we have to do is then use the shopify api at your end and then make sure that we've updated this information within the shopify catalogue itself so that's something.
rep,that can be done at this point of time so that will be one way of populating the data in your case so is there anything specific that you see you know just because you were talking about us patriots where i just opened up what are some of the different facets and filters that they provide on their site and another similar one is pictures on gold they they actually do this based on product category on metal type and shape and sub categories so on and so i did hear you mentioned some time back that this is not your complete read data i just wanted to understand from you what could be some of the different fields that you would want to add within these and how do you think we can go about getting the data for that .
prospect,can i share my screen and i can show you don't i.
rep,let me just make you the presenter yeah all right.
prospect,can you see my screen .
rep,yes i can.
prospect,so i'm pulling up this is our current website and it's building their commerce to service 2009 platform okay so we have 12 or not 12 we have 11 top-tier categories so area of pins educational kids apparel but we'll go into one that i know we are definitely gonna want facets for which is curriculum.
prospect,so within curriculum we have starters in subject areas so we have as you can see science agriculture citizenship creative arts all the stuff so i'm envisioning that being one facet if you want it to you know dig in there.
prospect,and then with in each one we have subcategories so and i don't know what the best way to set up facets so faceted search for this would be if you would have like standard category navigation and then we're faceting would begin would you begin like fascinating on this page would it be on this page would be on both and then within each category so we can go into like aerospace for example in aerospace we have four different books plus a helpers guide also set plus bundles so i would envision one facet being one facet we definitely want is.
prospect,each book in a category this one's grades one through three this one should be grades like four through seven or something like that grades three through five so we want to be able for customer few based on data we input say.
prospect,show me the curriculum for grades three through five or show me the curriculum that is a digital download so we have a digital download products and we have physical copies so the the facets have been determined but this is we've got such a wide range of prop products here because within each of these subheadings you're looking at anywhere from one to five to in this case seven different products the pins is another one for example so the things that we have on the 4-h shopify site we i believe we only have these pins but we have within member year pins just as an exam three types we're going a bunch of pins after good showed up so there's such a large number of <> and use it is that we haven't determined the fastest or probably going to be different for each one of the he's at lore except occasional kids is small so probably wouldn't need facets clearance outlet.
rep,repeat colleen i think at some point i still confused could here's some of the things you were saying it's like you got dropped off but i'm still here can you hear us.
rep,i think even i just lost calling for a bit over there but quite an i think i miss the last part that you were talking about .
prospect,okay all right great basically what i was saying was that within each of these subheadings<> category <>ends we have one for apparel and then we'll pay to have that would be that would be ideal too.
rep,colin just to repeat what did you just said colin is that within the each subheadings you said that there are other sub sub categories and that you would be wants to make it possible somehow that we can make those into facets also did you get that right.
prospect,yes got it.
rep,yes did you catch that with ridhima.
rep,yes i did yeah okay so our colin can we have access to this product catalogue because i think the one that we have currently just has about 118 products and it does not really have too much information about any of those products so is it possible for us to get our copy catalogue.
prospect,um i think so i need to do some digging what format would you like it in the reason i ask is i think we've been able to pull like a csv file.
prospect,that would go.
prospect,i can give you access to that would do okay let me see if i can dig that out because i know i pulled it out but it had a ton of information including.
rep,oaky.
prospect,products that we don't have on offered like still live on a site so yeah i also i have a question for you and i put this out to where we have to do an integration with whatever your commerce platform would be like this one which is sage 500 we're currently on an app 500 platform and the upgrade probably won't have i've asked the one of the folks that are doing the bids on the integration what the order of operations is in terms of getting a catalog over to a new e-commerce platform because it takes product data from our erp and pushes it through to um pushes it through to the e-commerce platform so i don't i don't know if it's gonna be and then we don't have a firm date for that that we're pushing to have it in march but it's up to our it team to actually do it i mean it was supposed to happen in december and then january and now it's not trying to march so based on that i don't think we're gonna have a like full catalogue on a new site ready until march but i can definitely send you what we have on this site now.
rep,okay i think that should be good enough for starters so that we can actually start analysing what are the different feeds view on the filters on and you know just make sure we've got all of those things logged before we can actually start implementation in march or maybe if it's april depending on you know when you move to the new platform but i guess be a good start for us just to kind of understand this data a lot better and come up with some filters and the designs accordingly on how they would be working.
rep,okay so ridhima do you want to share with colleen the the piece where how let's say once we create the catalogue with the attribution the correct attribution that you need .
rep,how to put it back into shopify just so that colleen knows what we researched and he has that for visit oh .
rep,so what what i'm gonna do is let me just send that across in a documentation to collin i think that would be better.
rep,okay so what i do is i will just send in an example of you know how you can actually go ahead and upload that back using a shopify api so let me come you know do that for my test site itself on shopify i think that would be a lot better with the right examples and then you know if required and collin can then go ahead and play around with that as well so so that he knows how it's done.
rep,that's fine so then the next piece ridhima is what calling talked about big basket but the bigcommerce we have a customer called big basket site so with bigcommerce the if the same thing so we went with us patriot tactical on a lot of catalogue aspects also right so comparing shopping to big commerce what are your thoughts and feedback so colleen has that also for this information.
rep,okay from our end you know the way the implementations are a lot easier in shopify and it's very easy you know whenever you're trying something new it's a lot easier to get those things implemented within shopify than it is on a big commerce the same thing for field upload a lot of the times when people are using big commerce they are using a lot of other third parties to get their catalogues sorted out and you know then they try and slowly build across within bigcommerce whenever but ya more from this is more from the implementation perspective because i know that the big commerce dashboard also has a lot of different things which may excite you from the perspective of adding new products there and so on but what we've seen it's a lot easier to maintain a shopify site just because of the way they handled having different templates you can always have a copy of the live template make your you know technical changes there and then make sure that you actually take that life you don't lose any data it's pretty easy to switch from one snapshot of your production site to another without really losing much data so everything is a lot more seamless on shopify than it's on bigcommerce.
rep,you probably can.
rep,did you get that callin .
prospect,no i got you to the ease of shopify and selling but something about the live templates and then that was when i only dropped off.
rep,ridhima didn't mind is repeating please.
that's fine. so yeah i was just saying that the whole maintenance of code on shopify for a side becomes a lot easier because as in how you add a new site you're also going to be adding in a lot of third-party plugins the whole implementation is a lot of you know easier to do within shopify because of this whole templating thing that i was talking about where you know you can take a specific template live and then you want any of your other third body guys to work on some specific implementations and that can be done in different templates and it's very easy to switch from one to the other you know if something is not working you know you can just go back to the other snapshot you had of your site without really having to worry about getting in the third party guys to fix it for you and so on in big commerce all of this requires a lot of specific changes and you know the ability of getting test sites to try out your implementation your staging environments all of that is a lot different from the way shopify handles it so shopify makes it a lot easier for you to you know handle the infra the admin piece as well as making sure that all the technical pieces can be handled a lot more seamlessly and more smoothly than how it is on the bigcommerce.
prospect,gotcha okay.
rep,we've seen you know lines go live but shopify you know if it takes a couple of weeks the same thing may take a month to do in big commerce because of all these other things involved.
prospect,okay so creating facets that i think that because we're having the conversation about that's an insertion it seems like doing the actual product search and property condition seems to be similar for you guys on the cup and shop fine but the faceted search you wouldn't say is it any easier and any less easy on big commerce or shopify is it the the the outcome is typically the same on either platform.
rep,the outcome is going to be typically the same one both the platforms because you know it's the implementation being done by unboxed and we provide an in page ajax implementation on both the platforms it's just that yeah implementation as a process may take longer and may be you know not as clean as it could be on shopify that's the only difference but the end result we can do it on both.
prospect,okay well thank you for that overview that's very it's very helpful i think a lot of big decisions that need to be made.
rep,okay so colleen from our perspective i don't know what your timeline is in terms of when you are looking to move but i'm assuming at least a couple of months away at least few months if not couple from what i wanted to sort of give you two caveats on what i had mentioned to you last time regarding you know crossing the five million chasm the crossing the five million chasm what i wanted to clarify myself was seeing when you are in shopify platform the what what you want to be absolutely absolutely sure is not necessarily the flexibility of what you can do but the presence of a particular feature so let me explain what i meant at that time with shopify there are a lot of features that are sort of button down for you right there's a certain path created for you like if you were to compare and i don't know if you're an iphone user an android user but if you're an iphone user you might have experienced that you know it's a very best path sort of figured out for you it's a closed system you can't do a lot of a lot of manoeuvre but the path that has been figured out it easy for you to use right versus on android it's a very open system and you can do a lot of maneuvering you can build a lot of you know deep poking apps and stuff like that and you can do a lot of stuff a lot of flexibility but it makes it for a complicated usage so if you want a very straightforward path a simple user interface like apple and i may not necessarily be the most appropriate system from that perspective however the key to know that apple has not only figured out the best path but has also figured out a lot of features versus android may not have figured out the best path but it might have overloaded you on features ok so if i am a person let's say i'm an individual who's not technology savvy i just want to use a smartphone for the purpose of using it but not lose out on features apple is as good as anything else but if i'm very technology savvy i do a lot of integrated things because i want to make the best use out of the platform android is the way to go so when i was talking about shopify shopify is your apple platform now we've not spent as much time on b collen to really understand and see and that is this is something i want you to sort of discover for yourself because you will have unique needs outside of what what unbox provides as a service you know in terms of full fillment shipping lot of other things what the big difference between b commerce and shopify you want to really look for is one does it have the features and what's the flexibility does it have for those features that you can customize the crossing the 5000000 chasm means that you still for example you talk about express or ancient greg or ashley furniture okay these are some of our customers these guys are huge behemoths enterprises is billions of dollars in sales online and offline right they still have the same premise of what they need to do online they still need to have fascinating the still need to facet shipping etc what they try to do because the reason they go to ibm or atg is because just doing that particular feature let's say it's shipping and fulfilling they have a unique process of their own that they want to introduce that differentiates themselves maybe it's cost-cutting maybe it's whatever it is and those platforms allow them to do that that's what you need to sort of figure out whether big commerce allows you to do something custom that is very specific for you to go from five million to 10 million what you have identified that you need to do as as far as customisation to imprint your differentiation as a business for example your business might need let's say you need to not only sell on your site but you also need to sell on different it's different commerce platforms right our marketplaces and stuff like that i'm not saying that that is the case i'm just saying that's an example does shopify allow you to do that there's a very straightforward path to do that or it doesn't even allow you to do that which has bigcommerce as allows you to do that that's a very clear answer you have to go to liquid commerce it's shopify does not allow you to do that right but if shopify and becomes both allow you to do that and what shopify does is it's a very prescribed path and it does not work for you but big commerce allows you to customize you have to go through it bigcommerce so that's where i feel that you want to really focus on because unless you know specific things and and i'm not saying you don't know i'm just saying unless you actually go through the exercise of figuring out specific things that you need to do to go from five to ten and which platforms allows you to be flexible enough because of the differentiation you need to imprint on process to grow your business that platform is that platform does not support you in that that was the wrong platform now shopify iv all know is a very closed system so it may have the feature but it may be a very prescribed path if you just want to start the feature i would absolutely suggest go with the prescribed path because if you try to customise it without knowing what you need to customise you're gonna spend a lot of time and effort and a lot of heartache what we've heard about the commerce is that it has a lot of features just like shopify a lot of them are closed also but it has some more flexibility then like i said we've not spend enough time to do that to really know the big differences between the two but as far as i know they're very similar in that sense with some differences in how it might be flexible so i just wanted to make sure i add those two cents of what i had said last time to clarify because i don't want the last thing i want you to do is evaluate a lot of platforms pick one doesn't work out for you and you blame that that point when moodle set this that idiot you know so i just want i absolutely am clear on what i was trying to say there.
prospect,yeah i appreciate that and i think that what we've been doing is it at least you what you said brought up more over desire for us to understand our requirements needs compared against the features on offer so well you didn't you definitely spurred us to action on that you didn't lead us down any specific path choice hey different thunder so don't feel like we said alright well now because mom dude invest in magento right away that's not the case it's more of understanding which platform is best for us and i think we've been so familiar with shopify that we didn't give the other ones a fair share of evaluation.
rep,so nope that's perfect man i'm glad to hear you say because the last thing i want to do is put you down to certain paths just because i said so right and sometimes i say things in a certain way that sounds almost convincing but i have not run any e-commerce company so you know there's a lot of things that i generalised when i said it the first time i just wanted to make sure that i i cleared that input in that so perfect so i'm glad you said that so calling from your perspective you tell us what i will obviously take a look at before ajmal a catalog whenever you get a chance to send that to us csv or whatever format you feel most comfortable and easiest for you what do you feel is the next step do you want to see you value it do you want us to say okay this is possible this is not possible same exercise or you want to take it one level further anything else that you want to evaluate and work on .
prospect,umm from from you guys i think that i honestly we should probably put our any work you guys do on hold until i just don't want you guys to end up working on something and then have to wait until like i don't know march or april to do anything which i mean i'll still sending over the catalogue if you guys want to evaluate it but we're not going to be doing the integration piece at least until march because our map doesn't like the accounting system needs to be updated and what if the integration is going to be done the catalog is going to be done whether it's on shopify or bigcommerce until then or whatever we end up and once we do that then i'd rather have you guys go in and then we can start evaluating but i'll still sound over our existing catalogue just so you can get an idea of the breadth and depth of products we have as you said but i think that in terms of doing any more work on your end right now we have to get our own ducks in a line on the requirements and all that other stuff that i'd rather make sure we're good to go before i tell you guys to go and then we have to backtrack or change what we've done.
prospect,end of february.
rep,end of february perfect.
prospect,and if everywhere and i'll be the integration half it either has to happen by the first or second week of march if it doesn't happen by then we can't let it happen until june.
rep,when you say happen you mean start.
prospect,yeah because.
prospect,what the reason why is we have a big sale that we run on our curriculum that i just showed you guys it's our biggest month of the year and we can't jeopardize any systems being in transition and failing so if if there's an issue with our inner group like our math systems i think during that time and we could jeopardize losing you know a lot of a lot of business.
rep,so we're pushing to have it happen before april and if so follow up with me in late february because all having a good idea of if it's happening when we want it to or if it's not.
prospect,got it are you by hands attending a tell west colin it's in a 22nd order it's a conference out in california february 22nd to 25th.
prospect,uti oh.
rep,no etail e-t-a-i-l.
prospect,etails.
rep,etail. etail west.
prospect,no you know what i'm but i would think my boss might be.
rep,he's attending some conference.
rep,well that'll be fantastic because we're exhibiting and speaking etail west so what i was just gonna say is that if you by any chance or attending or anybody else they'll be fantastic to catch up at that time if not right after the conference we'll try to reach out again then.
prospect,that sounds fair it sounds like a good plan.
prospect,okay thank you so much i appreciate.
rep,ya no problem you're welcome thanks colleen welcome.
prospect,thanks have a great day.
rep,thank you you too.
prospect,enjoy costa rica thank you bye.
prospect,um is for you to spend some time you know maybe not today but another time going through stuff with lorraine just so she is up to speed on what you know i've given her all the documentation i've had the presentation she has all that but to give her the opportunity to be walked through some stuff so that she can have some questions.
prospect,you know what i really want to understand is from both pieces that we discussed which is a replacement of two of other products that we have which.
prospect,is our site search with sli and our web recommendations with um well magnetic and outlets who they're owned by just to know what it is that you would require and what the steps would be.
rep,got it perfect so the typical process would be as following we had obviously shared with you the pricing for both products combined into one yeah and and you i'm assuming you also want to make sure you test this so depending on how you want to go about testing this the approach could be multiple ways so one is you agree on the pricing we sign a contract there's a clause that gives you the ability to walk out of that clause within 90 day notice so if you are tested for 90 days you don't like it you have the option to walk away.
rep,so that gives you a very easy way to try trial see it works it doesn't work you can walk away okay so that's number one number two is once we get the contract out of the way and everybody is happy with the numbers the next step would be to set up an implementation call with our engineering team and we go through the implementation call which basically outlines your specific requirements because based on the experience with these two products you probably already know what how differently you want to do certain things so or or maybe you want to keep it the same but there might be some no answerst o it that we've not talked about so we want to make sure that the customer and the engineer talks and the sales is out of the way because you know we'll say anything to do whatever i'm just kidding so we we want to make sure that everything gets written on paper exactly how you want it how you want implementation the engineering team evaluates that comes back with a time line then you say okay this is the time line this is how we're gonna do things you approve the project we started we exchanged access etc whatever it needs to be done and then we start the project based on the timeline we tested qa it everybody's happy we launched it and post launch we obviously monitor makes any post-lunch changes that you want us to change you go through the training with the tool and and that's it then you obviously will be here with our 24/7 support for anything that you want us to do there will be monthly check-ins with our customer success team will be running specific reports to sort of keep you guided and make sure that we keep telling you what things we're saying and that's sort of the high-level overview of what you can expect of how this would work now how much each individual piece takes is for its time line it all depends on how you want to take out the project for example we did another project we just finished one step of the project with and i think magnetic was buys a kind of name of the companies on my tip but i'm trying to buy second advice dotcom uh magnetic bought somebody for the recommendation.
prospect,i bought my mic.
rep,my wife was that my advice .
rep,so this company also had something very similar and they wanted to not stay with my vice because i think there was some great change and stuff like that so but if they're using somebody else for search they're using adobe not sli but the my advice contract was coming up for renewal sooner than the adobe one so they wanted to first implement recommendation than just do that and then do site search i'm sure you've heard of a company called popery .
prospect,yeah oh yeah we know popery very well.
rep,yeah so uh.
rep,yeah go ahead i'm sorry.
prospect,so there are a large group i think i and uh have you dealt with is it bob webb.
rep,we worked with mike mike michelle and or mike yeah michael michelle and bob robinson .
prospect,bob morrison okay okay switching from my vice as well.
prospect,oh bob morrison okay that's right.
rep,i'm sorry it's bob morrison. and yep and i think bob just joined them up fashion to suggestion but recently recently enough he was brought in to manage the commerce piece and i think michael is the vp of the commerce for them.
prospect,okay all right okay.
rep,so so they had the same type of scenario so it all depends on and they were very clear they have 15 sites so everything had to be done 15 times right so slightly different world but from that perspective the idea was pretty much the same to say that you know what's the timeline how do we go about implementing one or the other and what's the timeline really look like so that's that all depends on you guys.
rep,so hopefully that helps.
prospect,yeah so getting getting further into i guess into specifics and this is really the piece i really i wanted to just get your thoughts on is.
rep,please.
prospect,currently four if we i'll separate the two i'll separate and the web recommendation.
prospect,recommendation it was a fairly easy implementation based on the fact that we only had so much data okay.
prospect,we only had you know certain pieces of information of what our categories were and all that data came directly from our web provider to to my vice they created that feed went to them after we worked with them on it and and you know i guess so understanding what how your data needs to be mapped is kind of where i'm coming from it from a technical expertise because my technical skills that i have on site we're working on a huge back-end upgrade but i don't want it to stop us for our web stuff moving forward so i've got to kind of determine what type of it resources are needed.
prospect,that's really what for this of weather when we can do something or not that's kind of the.
prospect,<> from a standpoint of say mapping the web recommendations data feed along with the site search data feed that gets sent to sli i i mean my preference would be to start you would start out with exactly the same data feeds that we have available and i'd love you to take a look at those to say these work or they don't.
rep,absolutely so and ours works exactly the same way so there's two components for recommendations one is the analytics and analytics is pretty straightforward you drop in a analytics tag like google analytics and one extra step beyond google analytics that we take to make sure because the specific signals are important for our recommendation engine is to actually track a click so let me are you guys you just dialed in right or can you see my screen.
prospect,i can see your screen.
prospect,and i believe my voice check track that as well so .
rep,okay perfect that's already been done then it would be pretty straightforward to replace sort of find and replace so the idea is let's say that if i went to say jewelry and say necklaces.
rep,and i clicked on the fifth product like so the idea is for us to actually know that you clicked on this product on this page and then went to this party okay so tracking that specific click and the analytics that's step one what you mentioned about the catalogue is absolutely correct that is step two so if you have an existing feed just give us a copy of that feed 99% we should be able to make use of that or at least let's say let's say you have a requirement that we cannot fulfill based on that feed we can at least do exactly what my advice has done for now and then make that is a face to to say when we do get to that point where you're able to send us a data point to be able to make a change and we can do that but if there isn't anything like that 100% the same people would work.
rep,okay so those are the two things and then for the actual recommendations you just drop in a div tag and we'll actually populate the content so it's all front-end based so that would just work.
prospect,and that's the same thing with my wife.
rep,my wife .
rep,that's correct.
prospect,we have them on to all sorts of pages multiple pages.
rep,correct exactly super bender the category page product detail page called page thank you page home page wherever put those.
prospect,we also have them on email we have a another or i think our shape met confirmation emails as well .
rep,so who does the who sends the email because it is it my wife sends the email or is it if you have an esp that does that .
prospect,we actually work broncho is where we do all our emails and we basically vote for it to be replaced by my wife in the email.
rep,got ie so we just need to figure out how that integration might work.
rep,and if we can copy that or not so that's the only piece that we might have to be evaluate and quickly take a look at it.
prospect,and i believe my wife is integrated with broncho and that's why it was an easy thing for us to do.
rep,got it now we are not nativly integrated with bronto so that's why i said and we can probably figure that out and see what what is the effort that we need to make to make sure that happens seamlessly and if it doesn't cannot happen that we can tell you that up front so you can make that call and say okay if you can't then we cannot go with you guys or whatever the case may be so.
prospect,okay so i guess for from the technical standpoint that would help me i know we just went through the rug rex would you be able to send me a couple of sample implementation either the implementation steps along with your data feeds and that kind of stuff to understand what you require and that will tell me how much work i need to do on our end.
rep,let's do oh let's do the reverse robin if that makes it easy for you if you can share the existing catalogue that you have but you use to send to my wife and if you can send a sample we can tell you easily to say this works for us so that takes care of that piece i will send you the analytics piece the instructions on the analytics.
rep,it will take me a couple of days to put together because we try to make sure we you customise the documentation specifically to your website .
rep,so i'll have mind you take a look at your website and specifically identify where the code needs to go in .
rep,so we will give you that as well and if you can send us the catalogue we'll take a look at that in the meantime and we'll be able to do that as well.
prospect,okay so what i can do is i can get you a sample now i believe we already did a oh my god i'm moving my brain here we already did an agreement both in the sharing of data.
rep,we've having it here so this correct.
prospect,we didn't have you here yet did that so because of that what i can do is we will get a data feed example from for both for what sli receives along with what my guys provide receive and i will get that we'll send that over to you .
prospect,okay so i'll somebody do that i am only here till thursday and then i get to go to someplace really really warm so um lorraine will be the contact and she will you know try to keep things at least moving so that they're looking at things and i will be back in the office until february 29th so um i just wanted to make sure we had this call prior to that so that at least we could have some information going back and forth to figure out when is what's gonna work for us and when could we actually do some kind of a switch .
prospect,february 29th got it.
prospect,february 29th i'll be back.
prospect,yes the lorraine will be lorraine is the main contact here anyway from a technology from the it side that's still my point got it. the one that will be running this so i think next steps we talked about at least from data going back and forth and then maybe you and laraine with whoever you feel worked at your team just to kind of walk her through what all the you know what your your tools do and how everything works some examples of other sites using it a potpourri group would be great if you want to give her one of those sites we can take a look we do have connections there so um that would be great .
prospect,that sounds great.
prospect,ya sure sounds like a plan.
rep,all right awesome and i think just to give you a note it was the first week of september robin in case you want to check on that ndas when we sent you the signed nda.
prospect,okay yeah oh yeah kathy are my legal finance person probably has it i can just recheck it but i know we did that right before you came back your proposal and you did your testing and you had your survey stuff so.
rep,the stony creek girl brands.
prospect,thats right yep so it should be just fine.
prospect,great .
rep,perfect all right awesome there's anything else that i did not answer that you guys have questions on .
prospect,not from my standpoint lorraine i know you'll probably have a lot after she goes through things.
rep,perfectly so much robin andrew larrick lorraine and congratulations again on successful holiday season so that was great .
prospect,great thank you all right thank you thanks guys.
rep,apart from or the search and navigation feature as abhishek told me about so before we start let me know if there's anything you want me to talk about.
prospect,no we're <> away what you have.
rep,alright okay alright did you see the screen.
rep,okay great so this is just an implementation checklist so that we maintain so that you know once our implementation team starts the work we are all on the same page and all the elements that are being implemented so i didn't see that you are on bigcommerce correctly is that right.
prospect,no we are on next week .
rep,oh you're on next week okay okay so i think that is just someone from my team who mentioned that okay so for next rate what we do is we work on an in page ajax implementation so what we require is access to your dev environment so that we can start with working on the implementation there itself and of course we will be able to directly pull in the product catalogue and then provide site search and browse as phased in a phased approach so are you currently using any other search provider .
rep,ok so because generally the problem only arises if you are using someone else for your search and category pages and then you obviously go ahead and make the switch for all the features together itself but maybe in this case we can start with doing search in phase one and within three to four weeks after that we can then plan on doing the implementation for the category pages as well.
rep,all right so the first things first is the auto suggests the type of head that you see when someone starts typing in anything on the search box so let me just give you an example of the different layouts that we have on our end just to give you a better idea of how the slope so we can do a lot of different layouts we can do a two box autosuggest we can do a single box autosuggest way it's shown here things that you see here now the first one here is something we call the guided search so hasn't how even start typing in something he starts segmenting the data based on any of these specific categories subcategories or brands and we start showing those there and then we have the popular product section so this is driven through the unboxed analytics system so we start tracking what products are being kicked on added to cart and ordered on your side we through search pages all through the category pages and based on all of this information we start showing in the corresponding popular products for any of the queries that that are being typed in so that's on the popular products and then we have the top query second so this is again coming in through the analytics aggregated data where in real time we start capturing what the users have been typing on the site and they show this and all of that especially what's really trending as different keyword suggestions on the site apart from this we can also set some of these suggestions from the back end based on the different fields for example it could just be a color plus category combination or a gender plus a category called configuration and so on so all of that can be handled from the back end can be configured from the back end so a lot of different ways of doing this anything you like in put it in any specific way out or you want me to send these over to you you can take your time and give me a quick.
prospect,yeah if you could send that to me i would like to review it sure alright so and you do have a responsive site right.
rep,okay so the implementation yeah just from the implementation perspective and are you using google analytics to keep a check on the analytics numbers and all.
prospect,i believe it's been somewhat set up but i haven't yet seen anything yet .
rep,can you can you give us a read-only access to that because it just helps us and you know fetching the list of the top search queries on the site or just written on how they can work and have been at this point of time and then that's what we use are the comparison metrics when we start working on our search algorithms to make those better month-on-month so if you did just provide his read-only access to that that'll be great.
rep,<><><><>
prospect,actually ridhima this is a completely new website so even if we give you the access or then you won't find any data over there.
rep,okay okay so so maybe we can just do this okay so there's no data whatsoever you saying.
prospect,yes exactly.
rep,it's all right then maybe we can look look at it a little later on so it won't lie just to see how things are looking then okay.
rep,all right and this is fine so let's go on to the next section so i'm just gonna go to your okay now the first thing that i want to talk about was how do you want the pagination to be is it something that you're looking at an infinite scroll or you just want to go ahead with the same configuration right now how do you guys gonna go about that.
prospect,i like when it has more i think it's better we made it less because the paging though took a long time to load but really i think it's better not like that.
rep,okay so you want to keep it this way it's a very visual train for results per page right wow so currently you're showing 24 results per page as i see here and you keep the same setting.
prospect,no i want to do more i want to have more more items to show.
rep,oh okay and do you want to do like an infinite stroller and as on how you keep scrolling you just.
rep,yeah maybe.
prospect,is that the best way to go .
rep,that's the best way that's generally the way people go about implementing pagination now.
rep,it just engages the customer a lot more. now i did see that you are doing okay so this should be okay and do you want us to keep rest of the pieces the rest of the design just the way it is right now so that we don't make any more changes or do you want any specific changes to this .
prospect,um i don't know about i don't know about in the design specifically i know we're missing images that we're working on but let's say an ad a stock item we want let's take the show up at the end .
prospect,things like that .
rep,so let me do is be keep the same design and layout and as an how you want more changes when you see us implementing this on a test site you can go ahead and make any more changes to that.
rep,but for now we can just yeah the other thing i want to check with you is not you don't seem to have any facets and filters on the left hand side and.
prospect,i would .
rep,ya go attending.
prospect,know say we do have the data ready meaning we have everything set we have the the refinements created and assigned to all the items so we're ready for it we just need it implemented .
rep,great so what i do is i will come up with a design for these facets and filters it's so that we can have those on the left-hand side now when we add those facets and filters then this whole category section that you see on the left side will disappear because instead you would actually be using the facets so is that okay.
prospect,yeah or how do you want to go about that yeah no that's what we want.
rep,and these facets are okay and the facets are going to be multi selective nature all of them so that.
prospect,i'm trying i wanna.
rep,take on anyone so they're all going to be multi select in nature you can select more than one from if every facet that's provided and as on how you select any one of those those actually get highlighted separately i'm going to share in a few screenshots that i'll just see you get an idea on how that's generally done right now all right and apart from this obviously that the search will also be providing you spellcheck algorithm that will automatically take care of any incorrect spelling's incorrect you know miss type words on the site i just want to understand if you're looking for any specific messaging for this or we just go with the standard did you mean.
prospect,i don't have anything specific.
rep,okay yeah okay then we go ahead with did you mean standard<><><> and i don't see any stored options currently on the site so is that something you would want to implement like for example by default it's always gonna be sort by relevance but you may also want to introduce sorting options by price or by discount or sale or any of those .
prospect,um i guess relevance<><> .
rep,um okay and okay let me see if i can show you how that's implemented just give me one minute.
prospect,ridhima we have like name and price walking.
rep,okay so do you just want us to go ahead and implement the same for now and maybe later look at adding anything else in a second phase .
prospect,no no we want that's higher to low and the relevancy.
rep,all right besides that the product overlays that you want now i already see some i saw something for out of stock and oh i do see these overlays for free shipping and out of stock are they any other overlay could be configuring.
prospect,we might have a new idea new arrival.
rep,new rivals sale free shipping anything else.
rep,i'm sorry continue.
prospect,and out of stock ok another question do you go variants for any of these products or are all of them unique so when i'm looking at this hearing there is not gonna be other type of this specific product.
prospect,no we do have the metric items.
rep,okay can you can you give me an example is this .
prospect,yes and that's not want me give you on one second.
rep,i'm have you that humidor that we've been testing found okay.
prospect,<< >>>and um - hmm - okay - 5hy g25 h yj a i'm gonna put it in the chest second 25 of h not media intern j.
prospect,got it pick up the first one.
rep,alright it's in different colors right and you have different okay you do have different images for different product .
prospect,yes better can color correct .
rep,great okay so we see in the catalog how the data is again and we try and implement something very specific for these variants for example if someone searched for this you know humidor in a specific color we want to make sure that we can actually try and show that colored product itself or art or do you actually want us to show each of them separately so if someone searched for this he wants to show four different products or just the one currently you just show one of them do you want us to maintain the same or how do you want to do that.
prospect,i think it's really better when everyone sees the colours is of a colour that they're looking for oh.
//yeah alright so we look at the variant implementation on our end once we you know get hold of love to see what are the different features we can implement that okay and how do you want us to treat the out of stock products do you want us to push those to the bottom of the pages by yeah feature okay.
rep,okay and besides that i guess do you currently have any kind of color swatches for each of these products or if it's just images and different colors.
prospect,i'm not sure what i mean.
rep,so let's see this product okay now then i select blue it actually shows me the same product in a different color but i don't know if you've seen some kind of different swatches when you just show let me see if i can throw in an example here just give me a minute so people actually show these colors watches
prospect,right that. yeah that's good.
rep,okay and is that something you already have at your end or.
rep,do think that we should have to be implemented.
rep,okay maybe what we'll see is we both you're catnip to see if they're these are the standard colors they are then we can come up with a color swatch on our end itself and then go ahead and implement that.
rep,okay how do you want us to create the price facet do you want that to be a range facet or do you want that to be let me show you an example of that or do you want a price slider instead of a range so by the way these are somehow some of the implementations that we've done for facets just so you know .
rep,and on this side we've implemented a price later but on some of the other side we also go ahead and implement arrays let me show you an example for that as well so do you see this this is now a range price range price facet will be and this is how a slide of it ah high part.
prospect,i personally like the range but are more people using a slider now .
rep,i think we've seen a mixed one to this some people find the slider a bit irritating some of them just like to go ahead with the range facets so i would say start with this and maybe as a phase two implementation you can try out how that's working for us as well.
rep,okay all right so i think those are the only questions i had for this do you have any kind of product ratings any data around that in your catalogue .
prospect,no not yet but it's something that we do have i mean it is active but we don't have anything in.
rep,okay as on how you implement that we should be able to show you latest reviews on the listing pages as well just a living example again how you see you.
prospect,uh-huh yeah that's good .
rep,okay any value within this product catalogue that changes with a user logging in or based on the user's location or all in all.
prospect,no not right now.
rep,okay perfect i think that answers most of my questions and as if now so here's what i'm thinking we start with implementing this on the search pages once you're good with everything that's when we run to get the same on your category pages as well that way you don't really affect your complete site just with one implementation.
rep,all right so those are the only questions i had we'll make sure that all implementation we do works well on the mobile as well irrespective of the auto suggest design you choose as you may have seen that there are designs where you have a side by side auto suggest as well but this will automatically switch over to a single box autosuggest on mobile devices.
rep,so you don't have to worry about that but when you're trying to choose the right layout for yourself.
rep,all right so those are the only questions i have let me know it said if you have any other questions.
prospect,um i don't think right now .
prospect,as soon as  possible .
rep,all right nice nice to know so as an excerpt i will share these details with you you can go over these and i think we should contact it we should be contacted with manju for the access.
prospect,for the what.
rep,for the access to the test environment.
prospect,yeah that's fine .
rep,okay all right so i'm gonna drop you an email on this and let me know if you have any questions okay .
prospect,okay thank you very much.
rep,all right thank you so much oh hey mom let me know in case you have any questions for me.
prospect,yeah ridhima i'll mail you if there are any questions.
rep,all right sounds good thank you so much.
prospect,shh there we go okay .
rep,okay all right so what recommendations would do is especially and it all depends on how you want to fit it into your design okay what recommendations would do it is basically guide the customer based on what their behaviour is on the site so let's start with a homepage you will get two recommendation and generators for the homepage i can show you some examples of that there we go okay so here's two recommendations hand-picked just for you and recently viewed products so what hand pick just for you does essentially is looks at three different algorithms one is the user behaviour second is a product behaviour and third is the <> behaviour what do they all three mean so let's assume that you have a brand new user okay we have no history of what that user's behaviour is so the user behaviour component will automatically go down in weight-age and product behaviour and collaborative behaviour will push up what that means is product behaviour is essentially looking at your catalogue what are your best sellers what are you known for what is moving really well or what customers are clicking on based on that behaviour the product behaviour will start showing those products second the collaborative behaviour is what other customers are seeing from a geography that they're coming from and starting to expose products that they would have never discovered by themselves right so that's and <> view is pretty straight for it's personalised to each user based on what products they've seen last products first then we move into let's say a particular category and let's say we move into this particular category now based on this we can show what are your top sellers in this category and i know they are currently ordered in a certain way but the customers can and should really what that would look like.
prospect,could your system reorder based on top sellers are most viewed or something or does it need to be able to block.
rep,yeah we typically trend i try to make it within its own block so here you can see top sellers so there are definitely tons of dresses right but these are the top sellers that we want to show and then you can scroll and the scroll bar could be something like this where it's based on this design or something like this depending on what what your design might look like right and so these top sellers are a little bit yes go ahead.
prospect,oh i'll just go say why well why is this more beneficial than using maybe the you know default magento top seller or recommended products.
rep,because your default magento if you let's say you go out of inventory okay they're still gonna show up or if you just tuned it that way that it don't shit doesn't show up it's not gonna replace itself but something else you all you have to always do is manually figure them out and if to manually place them and also depending on what the customers behavior has been on the site it doesn't change and adapt so for example i'm showing some top sellers and let's say i'm spending a lot of time on red shoes red color for example the top sellers will automatically adapt and start seeing more red color shoes based on the styles that you are looking at.
prospect,mm-hmm okay.
rep,that's with every user so if i'm gonna get blue starching blue me if you're looking at red it will start looking at red the next is if i'm actually going into a product detail page then if i have to see other shoes you know you have these <> like i don't know whether this is manually done or you're using something for it .
rep,that's obscene it's just a cross cross our sell feature.
rep,got it but then you can see her you there are two or three different elements in how you can actually expose the customers one is you can show similar products other similar shoes you can show other shoes that other customers have viewed this is something that amazon made pretty famous like dude also viewed or bought also bought you can add those in here as well so in a very short frame you can expose the customer to a lot of different shoes but you can pick from and so otherwise right now if they don't like these four they have to go back and go back to this page or they have to again restart the navigation.
rep,okay and so that's the idea in terms of keeping them engaged every step of the journey that they have how can we expose them to something that they would have never otherwise discovered or make it easy for them to discover a lot more selection of products so it's easier for them to be in a continuous loop of evaluation because i'm sure in your in your world especially something as personal as shoes you get a lot of page views before a customer decides to buy the product .
rep,so the more engaged you keep them the better you make that funnel fatter where you can see that a lot of customers will exit the site say after or five page views but most customers who buy tend to be between ten and fifteen page views or between 10 and 15 page views the more people will get to add to cart and eventually more people even is a ratio from add to cart to order is the same you still get more people to actually buy from you because you've just increased the number of people coming into that pod because that .
rep,all right awesome then the other piece and i know that you primarily either ryan .
rep,okay i just heard of beats i want to double check such that in right now you are not you're mainly selling shoes right there's no cross selling like belts and stuff like that and you any kind of dresses as far as i can tell is that correct.
prospect,i'm sorry keith it's a repeat that i just cut out over there .
prospect,no that's okay you currently know primarily sell shoes right it's not like you're selling accessories like say belts or it's only shoes yeah what do you see in the catalog errors all over so we have a category from women's and kids so you know when it comes to these product recommendations i'd like you know the system to identify you know if the user is only on kids shoes the only popular kids products for them and same thing for adults and that also a hybrid so you know that family customer that we have who will look for shoes for their kid and then also for themselves so how do how do you approach that i guess there's a question.
rep,sure so when you talk about similarity then we'd show the didn't that similarity in terms of how you've categorised or catalogue to say this is a kid shoe or send an adult then when you cross sell is when you identified to say you know in here where the kids when you're they're looking at a kid's shoe you know cross alarms out but have you seen that an adult buying to cross sell a kids shoe as well the reverse .
prospect,have i seen that ever.
rep,no have you what would you think about this to do we cross sell could see how customers buy from you we this is you your business so we don't necessarily assume that if a customer's looking at adults you can say this will go with your.
prospect,yeah it would probably make sense if they land results to just show adults shoes and grand kids just show kids but you know it is a discussion we've had is how do we how do we you know educate the adult customer that only knows native shoes from you know an adult perspective that we do have a kids line and.
rep,so we can experiment with exposing them to a cross sell for kids that could create a specific section that says kids shoes you know you may also like some kids shoes for the family or something like that where the title sort of gives them an idea to say oh it's not they were saying this is for you but if you're looking at an adult shoe page you can also suggest and say maybe for the family and you can show kids shoes and we can experiment with that too by implementing something like that and then see if people are people are clicking on that people are exposing that you're getting this cross channel exposure then is it actually behaving in terms of and resulting injecting conversions that we've had we have something to work with if it totally bombs we obviously will help you and remove that but i think the best way to know if you don't know the best way to know would be to actually expose there with something and our designer can come up with some ideas based on what we think might be really applicable to do that kind of cross sell .
prospect,of course yeah okay .
rep,does that give you an idea the final piece is on the card page so let's say i looked at this particular shoe and added it to cart and right here depending on what they are buying this is also a good opportunity for us to come in and say it's it's adult shoes do we want to expose them to say oh do you have family members you know little for the little ones in your family if you have any so we might have to work with some sort of a language that that is true to your brand of what you're trying to say but so true to your brand because we don't necessarily come across as assuming right and we don't want to come across as pushing salesy either so something that we can expose and say you might want to check out and then this area also we can expose them to say here's some other shoes you might be interested in or here's some shoes for the family if you have kids and stuff like that.
rep,so that would be also another piece where we can expose the the cross selling the kids but also other similar products so that's how from a customer journey perspective the recommendation widgets will be sprinkled around that will move forward the conversation of customer trying to discover products .
rep,total of nine of them .
prospect,and we can dye  nine differen
rep,sorry yeah nine different algorithms nine different widgets different algorithms mean different things for different pages like we showed you on the homepage you went to a hint recommended for you which is one of the most complicated something simple is recently viewed on the home page and category top sellers then product detail pages you have similar products for viewed also viewed bought also bought those we and then on the cart recommendation pages or cross-sell.
rep,does that answer your question .
prospect,yeah yeah let's see the search now if you want to give me one doing that one .
rep,absolutely so let's do on the search piece i want to show you some examples one i want to show you our back-end dashboard obviously but also the search i want to show you some examples of how we actually evaluate search now because you don't have because we don't have search today it's hard to sort of evaluate it but the way you can evaluate search is five distinct elements that you need in search one is the type a head right that is the first thing a customer with boolean records when they start using search and so what i want to show you is different verticals to give you an idea of how we design search and how should we think about approaching the solution for search that differentiates you from your competitors right so here's parts warehouse obviously they're not from your vertical but this is a parts warehouse where they sell parts for appliances and they have two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the vacuum cleaner they have so what parts warehouse did was they had to search boxes to accommodate for two different types of users one for parts and one for models so we obviously came in and said you can't do that you're putting the onus on the customer and number two what if the customer picked the wrong search box in that case we designed one search box and as soon as i start to type in dyson you can see on the left you have parts with part numbers and on the right you have models with model numbers here's another customer which is apparel customer very different kind of catalog and obviously very different verticals so here we want to make sure that the customer gets to engage with the product and with the categories so we show all the different types of categories and sub-categories show popular products and also show some keyword suggestions.
prospect,mobile how is it responsive how would that function in the mobile environment.
rep,yes so in mobile we it would be responsive would be it would not be as wide obviously it'll be more narrow down but and it would have more fewer category options fewer keyword suggestions and no popular products so this way but however it all depends on what your catalog looks like for this they have a huge catalog so showing popular products and mobile doesn't make sense but in your world you may not have such a huge product catalog so maybe showing some few products may make sense and mobile.
rep,but it is responsive yes short answer okay here's last example this is a grocery customer again in grocery if you look at your last grocery run you bought almost 1215 lots of products in a single transaction right so that's the same behavior online as well but the problem this customer was facing was it was taking almost 40 to 45 clicks to buy these 15 products so we redesigned their autocomplete and search experience to look like this where we actually show products that they've bought in the past in the left insect section under the assumption and the behavior we saw that you typically buy the same products that you normally buy a grocery right every week every other week it's the same products that you buy so with that said you can easily see that if i buy a chicken without skin i'll see that up top if you buy chicken boneless breast you'll see that up top right and for products that you normally don't buy you also see some commonly searched terms some popular brands and some categories and again you can see for products normally by you can quickly change the quantity and add to cart from right here so this way we were able to bring down the 45 clicks down to 18 to 20 clicks to buy the same 15 products.
rep,cool that's essentially what our implementation team would do for you is to try to figure out how can we is to figure out how can we design this experience that would meet the behavior that we've seen on the site the business that you're in and the differentiators that you have and design it that way okay.
rep,the next piece is let me show you some first off second okay so here's a powerpoint so next is the relevancy so we've actually solved 12 different types of queries that customer search with now not all 12 will be applicable to you but any there are applicable will automatically be solved based on the relevancy of the query next is spellcheck of customer misspelled zanda queries will show the corrected spelling of that keyword second will show multiple options if there are probable options more than one and third we automatically will start showing results for the most probable answer if customers over time start clicking on option two or option three that will automatically become option one over time next is stemming if customers looking for shoe versus shoes etc we automatically send those keywords so you don't have to do that manually it automatically takes care of those elements automated redirect if the customer is searching for something that matches exactly to your taxonomy he automatically redirects when you don't have to manually do that
rep,next is a head query search let's say i was searching for something very high-level which crosses multiple categories in your world it may cross different designs so let's say if i am searching for red shoes which we go into a lot of different designs that you have right and or red footwear any kind of like that how do we actually maintain and guide the customer through that experience is by showing all the right subcategories so if you were to call it subcategories but also show products at the same time here's another interpretation of that i'll show you really quickly i started for alexander wang who's a designer makes a lot of different categories of products so if i search for alexander wang i don't know what category the customer may be looking for so how do we actually show these products so totes we show totes up top you're gonna scroll horizontally to see all tote bags then you can horizontally scroll all shoulder bags dresses sandals pumps etc so this way on one singular page a customer can see all different categories of alexander wang without having to leave that page and this way we can also guide them in a very neat bucketed manner it gives them the exposure of all the products they may have not thought of discovering also.
rep,filters obviously you sell shoes so this may not be as applicable to you per se but if you if customers were searching for shoes and if you define filters in a certain way doesn't matter how you define shoes you automatically show them show the filters to you so search customers can search for shoes men's shoes women's shoes casual shoes red shoes doesn't matter how the search for shoes the filters will automatically kick in.
prospect,on the on our category pages already.
rep,right no that's true and that's why i said it may not be as applicable to you per se because if i'm looking at it it's just one category of shoes right so these are the three the most option and you would have clearly yeah but if you had multiple products different categories of products then that will become very important to identify what the customer is searching for and showing the most appropriate filters accordingly and that's may not which may not be necessarily that the case in the future right you may have other categories in the future is that any plans to expand.
prospect,yeah we're going to adjust the category structures how it talks you know instead of just listing the styles we're going to have boots shoes and just kind of make it a much more simpler category structure where the styles but they're not that makes sense.
rep,sure but i was thinking more are you gonna go beyond shoes in the future.
prospect,oh no no we are she bad a little man i should bradshaw not okay so the next thing is variances let's say a particular shoe was available in different colors and a customer was searching for that particular color we would automatically show the right image of that shoe it's a variance problem that we also solve we also have a color synonym corpus so if somebody was looking for a coffee colored shoe right but you don't have any coffee colored shoes but your brown color shoes you know the coffee and brown and close proximity to a chain will automatically show that also okay as your results page if a customer for whatever reason gets the zero results page because they totally garbage then the recommendations will also came to give them the ability to go back by showing a recent review or to go forward by showing some recommendations based on that users behavior in real time okay quick way to quickly evaluate alternatives if i were to i don't know why i like these shoes or there were too many reasons why i like to choose the style color the price if i wanted to quickly evaluate alternatives i can click on the see similar products link open up in a modal window see alternatives like them click them if i don't like them you can close and you go back to the search experience here's how we do it in mobile it's adaptive and responsive based on that and again on mobile you want to show a lot of variety because it's less space so if customer wants to see similarity this is the best way to expose them to that here's where our auto suggest would look like in mobile scope suggestions popular queries and recent searches depending on what type of catalogue you have we may also have thumbnails and subcategories or categories and search queries based on that okay here's a category of fineman ui so if i search for a very high-level query and i know that it crosses multiple categories subcategories show them i was also showing some filter options and some relevant products always showing products if i click on the subcategory and i if there are some subcategories we will show them as well continue to guide keep guiding the customer right and then filter and sort by options and also obvious your products we also have multi select filters that look like this out of the box with a reply button to optimise for a mobile experience any questions so far.
prospect,no looks pure above for a bit of information there.
rep,and this is the last piece from a merchandising perspective you also get access to a dashboard that gives you the ability to do any kind of merchandising that you want so you can control the fields that are searchable you can control the facets that you want to show you can also create synonyms so say for you i want to repeat myself in saying this you do not have to create synonyms for spell check or stand words but you have keywords in and jargons in your vertical then you have the ability to create these synonyms for example shoes and weightlifting were <> pretty sure you know this ryan are called lifters.
rep,right so out of the box obviously we cannot do that automate something like this this is purely a jargon for a vertical look unless you're in that vertical your nails hat we clearly can automate that but you do have the ability to do that.
prospect,now do you does your dashboard here lists what people are searching for and if they're finding any results .
rep,absolutely so this is what our conversion funnel looks or reporting looks like this is a pre tiered reporting the first year is a very high-level executive overview of what's going on so here's your high-level search conversion there's top search queries top products being added to card because of search top clicked products top zero result queries everything is by the way downloadable into excel for you to manipulate you also can see your top search queries and you can drill down into those queries to figure out what customers are searching for and what are they finding you can click on that individual query to see what the conversion funnel looks like for that query what products show up for that query and what is their performance and what is the queries performance over time over your trend line and the last bid is the products individual products and what is their performance in terms of views and add to cart and purchases and you can drill down into an individual product you can drill down into an individual product and see what its trend line is what queries does it show up for and what is the conversion funnel of that product you also get to merchandise so let's say if you wanted to merchandize a particular query saying your world it's obviously going to be shoes but let's say you wanted to merchandise in particular way it's a very robust merchandising dashboard you can also create custom landing pages and i'll show you what that looks like also you can filter based on any results and promotes or boost you can drag and drop for example you want to show this product up top and you want to show this product second and then.
prospect,this is for the search result page that you're referring to .
rep,correct you can also do that same thing for navigation also as you can see here instantly it will start showing those results.
rep,now you can create a custom landing page let's say live event just by right so let's say i do labour day 2015 don't get any results because obviously it's a unique keyword merchandise click on on the right hand side which is convert to landing page click ok and the entire catalogue is available for each keyword you'd say title let's say it contains shoes let's try that simple ok now search for live a day that shows up and you can take this url put in your email marketing campaigns ppc campaigns social media campaigns banner ads but i'm gonna have you supposed to follow them into the links will come straight to this page again .
prospect,and well this populate that category or the search box on the left hand side there as well.
rep,this this filters you mean.
prospect,filters .
rep,yes .sorry yes it will be up automatically.
rep,yep and you can still within here also you can drag and drop results and you can say i want accurate specifically how this works how this looks do that so now you fragile and you can see how it looks like same exact thing for your brows also so let's see if it honor to browse man okay this is what shows up and i can configure rules and browse and i can go to home men section men section the martian eyes same exact ability to control what customers being a browse behavior also and in you know you know in magento it takes for form pages to fill out to get a one custom landing page alright and you ever want to change the order of the products do anything like that
prospect,so ladies right now is showing the product in the home category. in the men category from the home page if i click on men and and you've declared those the products the product ordering in magento already and you're saying that this is going to overwrite that magento category layout .
rep,correct part of the layout of the ordering .
prospect,products
rep,that you up .yeah so you could if you wanted to so what you can easily do is rather than having to drive it from magenta which is not as user friendly and not easy to do you can drive it from here which allows you to do everything that you want to quickly do.// can i get it can it organized automatically based on bestsellers or no shoes .//yes it can definitely organize it based on that as well yes it takes a little bit of time of traffic to turn so we would recommend that you organize it based on what your experience is and then once we collect enough data the user behavior piece will automatically kick in that is correct .
prospect,now we so our site is native shoes dot com it's a us site native shoes dot com /va sloshed is our u or canadian site without have any any issues or do you see any conflicts because we do essentially run two different warehouses two different pricing.
rep,is it two different catalogs.
prospect,it's the same catalog but they're either products or they're hidden or show under depending on if you go see where says usa and at the top left corner there you could on a canada it's the same site it's just it's just the pricing updates and so if you're a little paulo now shop you'll see that it's got a see ad beside all the pricing.
rep,gotcha yep yeah so that is not a problem we can have two different sites so you can manage them independently so that.
prospect,was not the way i would want to imagine and apparently i'm just more concerned about any sort of issues that might come of it and another consideration is that we were using mst full page cache okay and i'm wondering how if there would be any conflicts with this and that cache.
rep,so the only conflict on caching would be if you wanted to personalize so there's not a conflict with recommendations because recommendations are turned based on the front-end so is the recommendations are figuring out on customers browser itself so we don't have to actually worry about it i kind of any kind of caching mechanism however for recommendation and search whenever the system gets updated that would definitely be cached i don't know how frequently do you update that is it once an hour it's over two hours.
prospect,something but you can't with you can declare pages to be ignored so maybe that's the way to go about it there's to have.
rep,search you can do that but for navigation you might want to cache it because then because it's not like we we can click bestsellers at the hour .
prospect,yeah well you know my main concern is just the a you know cache being incompatible with your system that's not the main concern.
rep,because i think for recommendations it's all done for the front end browser itself it is for every customer is going to be different right so we cannot obviously get it done through the back end and where it could be cached it will be all done from the front end but for the navigation and search it's okay to be cached because our systems will update once the day anyways based on a lot of popularity and the sales data would be.
rep,so that's the that's the product rayn.
prospect,yeah well that's a great knowing that looks looks very awesome and it looks like a big time saver yeah.
prospect,yeah i'm excited to get going with it so.
rep,okay sorry i hope that she was gonna be around and be able to join in but i'm glad that i was able to really show you the product but if if you have your calendar in front of you we can recommend a couple of times i can i can send you a calendar invite and block your hour forty minutes.
prospect,tomorrow i can do you know what's i where are you based out of.
rep,i'm in chicago .
rep,you're in a california.
prospect,ham no i'm in vancouver.
rep,<><><>  .
rep,i can do you know 10:00 a.m.
prospect,pacific time either remission.
prospect,hello
rep,hey ryan i'm so sorry i'm not sure what happened here can you hear me now.
rep,okay so perfect what i'll do is i'll send you a calendar invite for 10 a.m.
prospect,perfect sounds good .
rep,all right awesome serve well thank you so much really appreciate the opportunity and the support any questions that i did not answer ryan that you have .
prospect,no that's good all of you no look you all i guess like documentation again and maybe you can send me that presentation that you had there .
prospect,okay thanks so much .
rep,no problem sir well thank you so much really appreciate the opportunity and thank you for the chance to compete for your business .
prospect,yeah all right.
rep,thanks ryan.
rep,hello alex.
rep,hi how are you.
prospect,hi cecilia.
rep,hai cecilia my name is myrtle how are you doing .
prospect,fine thank you.
rep,okay cecilia i'm assuming there's more people joining in should we wait for all of them to join or.
prospect,yes let's see what happens hey hold on please.
prospect,okay one thing has has problem with a connection ready yeah it's vergia from shopmundo
rep,hi how are you this is monal from unboxd.
rep,okay all right awesome can you guys see my screen by any chance.
prospect,okay okay with this screen please yeah .
rep,do you think i scream yes yes ready okay all right awesome well so just way of introduction my name is morel patel  i am the svp & chief business officer for unboxd and i'll be the one walking you through the demonstrations great so first of all thank you for giving us the opportunity here today to walk you through our solution am i talking to i see sturgill cecilia and alex on the call is that correct is that the team i'm talking to .
prospect,yes this is the team for webmaster team in the shopmundo in dominican republic.
rep,all right awesome so i live in chicago by the way.
rep,and so i see you guys have the site both in spanish and english i am not good at spanish at all you could say i am the worst spanish speaker in the world so i will do the presentations today in english if that's okay with you guys.
rep,and i'll be viewing your english website today to just demonstrate some of the capabilities that we have so can you give you guys like a 90 second overview what got you interested in our solution and where are you today where you see that our solution would be helpful to you this is a quick overview from your perspective.
prospect,okay yeah okay alex - okay hello.
rep,okay yeah yeah right now we're looking for a solution because when we tried to search samples we've we see that many of them came because some related are in the description or maybe they are not related something they can find it right away maybe first name that appear in the title and then in the description or in the attribute that is inside of the products.
rep,okay all right so that's sort of the primary problem that you're facing today i see you guys are on magento and i'm assuming you're using magento based solution.
rep,right all right so let let me if you can see my continue to see my screen here's the agenda that we've prepared for you today will tell you a little bit about us so you guys know who we are where we come from what is our site search approach where do we actually see there's five components to having a really good site search and where we see the opportunity today on your site and why unboxd in particular what is so different about unboxd what is how we approach with technology and we'll show you some customer solutions as well to give you an idea of where we come from is that fair.
rep,awesome so real quick we are a bay area company with about 300 customers in the us.
rep,1200 customers globally so some of our customers are in europe australia asia and i think a couple in south america if i'm not sure if i'm not mistaken.
rep,we we've grown faster than anybody else in this particular space primarily because of four unique differentiators one is we have solves a lot of the technology problems that were not solved before and i'll show you what those are we create custom solutions for all our retailers whether you are customer or a small specialty site we have tremendous capabilities in terms of scale so we can scale up and scale out depending on your site needs and we are extremely competitive at our price point and extremely affordable and because of these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery here's some of the customers that we work with today on a global enterprise level we work with target newegg bells we also work with pure online brands like deborah lippmann black card shindigs and we our solution works on a lot of different platforms including magento so in case in the future you choose to move out on the magento through some other platform we can support multiple platforms essentially making our solution platform agnostic .
rep,i know i know this in this day <> on enterprise i know target and new egg it and knew it. i say they knew at the site website
rep,yeah got it okay so you've used newegg and target.
rep,got it okay fantastic so deborah lippmann is out of new york where purses out of texas shindigs out of indianapolis pura-vida out of california sylveon out of georgia these are all pure online customers but let's get into the specific five phases of site search so let me just show you first what are we talking about when we talk about site search okay so the number one thing we talk about site search is the ability to show the customers a type-ahead so let's see if i start to type in screen protectors you'll see that i see some options here like for product options i'm not sure why any of these four are coming up because i was trying to type in screen and you can see trying to show me some other products maybe the screen protector right here might make sense however the idea of the type-ahead is not just to show some products okay the idea of the type of head is to actually guide the customer to a lot of different sets of products to categories that they might not have otherwise looked at and for also to try to figure out what is the most optimised path that a customer can take in order to make sure that we can guide them to an actual conversion okay so that's what a type-ahead does and today the type-ahead from your perspective is not necessarily it's not necessarily taking that particular path and i'll show you some examples of what i mean by that okay so that's number one number two is these search results so let's say screen protector let's search for that now you might have more than two screen protectors by the way so i just want to make sure what a hits third if .
prospect,if you see in this case you don't see that suggesting for the user you are at the <> now you are the user a stander and you don't sign in in the site you are i guess and you don't know you don't say the the information suggestions for it for this quest is this area and we need this in the site .
rep,exactly so now let's say i'll show you it's like difference in how the solution works okay so if i search for screen protector yeah see two screen protectors right and then most of them are cell phones actually they're not but let's see if i search for screen protector is a plural in the word protectors let's see what that does first of all we need to fix the speed with which site search is rendering righ t now this is pretty slow so will terminate this much faster now i type in screen protectors you can see those two products also don't show up.
rep,this is what we call it's the relevancy issue now protector and protectors is essentially the same word happens to be singular and plural you want a system that actually understands the difference between the two today default magento and a lot of other plugins do not understand that difference the only way to solve that in those solutions is where you have to actually create some synonyms of the back end with unbox you do not have to do that and the next is showing the filters of the left so let's say let's say even if the search results were correct and i wanted to filter out based on 4g and 3g .
rep,so let's wait for the filter to take place okay so i clicked on 4g right now if i want to click on say wi-fi i want a 4g and wi-fi right i want both of those features .
rep,i cannot tell first of all i cannot tell what i selected that's number one number two if either select wi-fi or either select 4g that both does not allow select both so that's the third set of the experience that you want to make sure that the customer has the ability to do multi select and it's visually the user experience is clear enough to respond and tell them exactly what they do.
rep,so that's the user experience let me show you some of the examples of how unboxd does it the big difference from an unboxd roach is one the technology second is the business we try to understand the business that you're in and also the framework we give you a playbook according to which you'll be strategically and tactically be able to solve challenges in the future also so let's say you start a new category right you've never sold this category before how do you optimise for site search well that looks will come in and help you with that also okay so let's let's get into some of the specifics of how we approach this so let's take some customer examples and i'll show you these examples to show to give you an idea of the versatility of our approach okay so i'm using different types of customers to give you an idea for this really looks like okay so you guys can still see my screen right.
rep,so here's parts warehouse there are a texas-based company almost 35 million dollars in annual revenue and what they sell is parts for appliances right now the issue was they have two types of customers one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy but they know the model of the appliance that they have so they used to have 2 search boxes to accommodate both types of users we obviously came in and said no you can't do that one because you're putting the orders of the customer 2 what if they take the wrong search box and three you can only optimise one search box at a time so here's what we built for their solution if i start to type in dyson you can see that the left hand side shows parts right hand side shows models and you also have some keyword suggestions.
rep,here's an apparel company and they it's a very different type of experience for apparel because it has to be more engaging so here if i type in nike i want to show them all the different categories and sub-categories top queries but also popular products that actually pour relate to what they might be searching for .
prospect,yes we will search like this like this search engine .
rep,what sir i'm sorry.
prospect,we we write right now we need in in the shopmundo site like this you're singing solution that .
rep,exactly.
rep,thank you for saying that this is the last example that i want to give you guys so this is a grocery customer and in grocery if you think about your past karrueche one right you a lot of products in a single transaction you buy your tomatoes you buy your cabbage you buy your sauces you buy your meats lots of products in a single transaction right.
rep,so same thing is true for this customer almost 15 products are bought in a single transaction however the problem was that it takes about 45 clicks to buy these products okay so this is what we did to solve this problem .
rep,okay here's what the autocomplete looks like for them we because in grocery you typically buy the same products that you've bought before we show the same products that you bought personally to that customer we can add to cart' right here in the type-ahead for products that you don't normally buy we show commonly searched terms popular brands and categories okay .
prospect,this is like a supermarket a solution.
rep,that is correct you got it .
rep,now the next thing you need is spellcheck a lot of solutions in order to solve a spellcheck problem means that you have to create synonyms on the back end with unboxd you do not have to do that 90% of this of the spelling mistakes are automatically corrected and we do three things to autocorrect this we provide the we provide multiple options we pick the right up the most probable option and start showing the results automatically if the customers start clicking on option two the machine learning system will automatically make that option one and start showing the results next is stemming this was the protector versus protectors example right dress versus dresses so you do not have to solve do anything manually to solve this problem this is automatically solved out of the box you also give you the ability to create synonyms and i'll show you what that looks like also you also get the ability to redirect certain queries so let's say for example on shop window if i searched for or say power supply .
rep,you know that the best place to take me is to the power supply category rather than trying to show me the search results so within electronics [hmm] you could take me to let's say search for cameras and this is the page you want to really take with you so we fight search for cameras interesting you want to make sure you take me to the right category page right so this is definitely something that needs to be resolved.
prospect,yes yes the problem is if the search engine to magento not if a solution is not a specific in the inner searching it's only with we see us a the this year's in the sales in the day in the content in the in the content and the metadata information if you don't put the meta information good you don't have a solution and gene a good and the domains that people don't say they the information is searching in this pin this moment.
rep,that is correct that is one thing the second thing also is that even if you have good meta metadata you still need a search engine that actually understands the context so for example when i say context let's say i'm searching for a brown leather jacket right so in men's fashion i'm searching for a brown leather jacket let's see if you have clothes and shoes that's a casual empty.
rep,oh you're still waiting.
rep,got it no .
prospect,call information in women.
rep,like taking you to the url yeah but we need like to specify which church we need to go.
rep,exactly you got it because the idea is that even if let's say i search for brown dress or let's say the dress was let's say the yellow dress okay if i search for the keyword yellow dress the idea is that dress is the product and yellow is the color attribute.
rep,what magenta typically does it will say i'm gonna look for the word yellow and the word dress in anywhere in the catalog and i'm with all the products that i can show that is not house where it should be you should actually first search for dresses and then push the yellow dresses up top.
prospect,awesome that would be nice.
rep,that is exactly what our solution does some other interpretation i wanted to show you simple stuff here's here's a cycle the out net out of uk i search for alexander wang and alexander wang makes a lot of different categories of products right so how do i show all the products that are made by alexander wang but still make a good user experience and we do that by what we call is bucketing so here i search for alexander wang and alexander wang makes tote bag shoulder bags dresses sandal pumps etc i can see all the tote bags here you can see all the shoulder bags here i can see all the dresses sandals and pumps.
prospect,different suggestion in there in the in the results using search engine in the site.
rep,correct it is in the search resul ts engine so if i search for the one alexander way yes next is dynamic filters so you have a lot of different categories of products you have from electronics to apparel to cell phones etcetera so for different categories of products different filters will make more sense and from that perspective you want to make sure that you optimise the customer experience by showing them the right set of filters for the right sort of category so unboxd also gives you the ability to do that if you want to define a specific set of filters for shoes you can define that and the search system will automatically show that if you define driving for shirts defined at once third system will automatically show that.
rep,next is variances so let's say here i was searching for red dress and you have that same image for a dress in four different colors let's say it's in black blue green and red and black might be the primary image but you want to show the red image of that dress instead of the black image right so we also solved that problem the problem we solve is the color synonyms so if you let's say have in your catalog something called a red dress but a customer searches for a crimson dress you automatically show crimson first if you have crimson if you don't have crimson we'll show red instead.
rep,awesome great .
rep,next is zero results so there will be instances where customers search for something that you don't carry and it will result in a zero results page well in what our best practices show us that you want to give the customers the ability to go back in their experience or go forward so recently you would give them the ability to go back and recommendations give them the ability to go forward these are all tracked based in real time based on the user experience make sure is more like these this is something i can show you so let's say if i search or .
prospect,okay it has a question for you right now we have in the shopmundo site different currencies like peso or in dollars and they they this is not a problem in the in the unboxd a solution to do this question .
rep,yeah so what we do is we don't necessarily send you the currency we'll send you the data right and you're getting on so we'll send your product data in the details you essentially decide what currency to spell what i hear what you're saying is let's say this is thirty five dollars and 33 cents in the us i can now change my currency and say i guess this is.
prospect,ok we have this and we have the language if the people enter to language english the people searching in english information.
rep,so basically we can send you both pieces of data and assuming these are two different fields that you have one is in us dollars and what is the other currency.
prospect,peso.
rep,so if this is pesos you have one column for dollar than one column for pesos isn't it correct.
rep,yeah so if you both details and will respond with both data and depending on which currency set you can decide what to show.
rep,does that make sense does that answer your question.
prospect,<> i mean like if we're looking for a prod we can look also for the prices right but if i want to show pesos i mean like the result will change depending on the language i will select level if i am making the search in the spanish version it won't bring any problem with the currency.
rep,that is correct because the idea is that when we pass the data back to magento will give magento all the results all the information that it means to show the results that you've defined there's some logic here that says okay language is english and currencies pesos so show this if it was language of spanish and currency was pesos show something else so this in spanish etc.
rep,idea is that we provide all the details that magento needs and then magento based on its front end logic can decide how to show because it had all the information to show it .
rep,okay right now we are not filtering like results depending on languages right now we're everything that we're showing english like everything we're showing english in spanish like all the products are in both versions.
rep,correct yeah absolutely what i'm saying is so let's say let's go to electronics by the way do you guys sell only to the dominican republic or do you sell outside of dr.
prospect,right now the dominican republic but we're a we are thinking on spending in the caribbean and the united states so no day bender sellers i'm going to be from united states <> before we'd spent the united states so people from the <> can buy from the united states.
rep,got it so let's say i'm in english language and i see one used from 10000 pesos right.
rep,let's convert that to spanish and now it says one use from oops sorry it's all spanish but it converted into english again you saw it right.
prospect,yes i think that's okay.
rep,there it is one you sado up anyways so i mean obviously there's there's some issue in here picking up the spanish language but let's say it was showing that spanish sentence so wherever it's picking up that data from today right there's probably a spanish version and an english version of the catalogue we're always picking up that data from if that's what it's going to send you the data so magento can then choose and say oh it's in spanish i'm going to spanish column or <> it's an english it's in english column.
prospect,oh now i have another another question in this case in an iphone exactly the problem is iphone is like a - and be out we have a problem with sears an iphone in this case because the information is different for name like a different art a there's capital letter on another.
prospect,yeah like right now sometimes we have problem because the search engine they like case sensitive.
rep,okay yeah i mean case sensitivity is not an issue with unboxd but obviously that is something we take care of but the the issue is how do we translate from english to spanish which the spanish to english that's what i was trying to answer the question where we provide both pieces of information back so you can decide which to show when based on what your logic assignments .
prospect,okay because for example right now if you if you look in the spanish version for the word mobile it will bring bring you all the phones because or if you look for cell phones in the world can you hear me i lost.
prospect,if you look for cellular that's more in the english version we had the data search engine look for mobile it translate or it has this you know cinnamon.
rep,cinnamon yep.
prospect,yes for cellular its look for okay you have here cellphones i will look for cellular.
rep,cellular.
prospect,c-e-l-l-u-l-a-r one l c-e-l-u.
rep,oh c-e-l-u. got it
prospect,correct. oh yes are you it walk it also will bring you like all the phones.
prospect,because you created a synonym on the back end
rep,we have the ability to do that as well when you created something called spell
rep,it seems like so when i search for cellular. you created a synonym on the back end called mobile phones or mobile.
prospect,mobile that's why for example i found out that someone <><> it's a like the description said that it has mobile technology or it can connect with mobile you need to do english to find it.
prospect,<><><>
prospect,okay and that's the problem.
rep,got it that's only so that is exactly what unboxd takes care of it's not a keyword pattern match it's not just saying i'm gonna look for this keyword in all the fields that are searchable it will actually understand the context of the search so it will not show a laptop when somebody searching for a mobile up top it may show laptop at the bottom of the search query .
rep,the first top results will always be the actual products the actual mobile cell phones.
rep,<> a context does that answer your question i just want to make sure.
prospect,right now we don't have a question we thinking different right now i jump to today develop an area i think in we we have the code or you put the code in my hosting we what is there they the process to develop to add these this year's engine in the solution in their shopmundo site.
rep,got it so because you guys are magento you have a magento extension you install the extension and essentially that gives you the ability to call unboxd so the extension that takes care of getting us the catalogue so you can define which columns of the catalogue come to unboxd and then you can make calls to unboxd shut up magento and unboxd will respond in a way that magento understands and then you can start showing the results and it will give you a simple div tag for the autocomplete for the type-ahead piece.
rep,for this for this please this again i'll give you a simple div tag which you add and there's one more piece called the analytics so you deploy the analytics it's it's just like google analytics just simply deploy a javascript snippet and that's it that's the implementation.
prospect,okay okay okay it's very easy to do insert to do in the site and this is and we we need another question we have a jquery in the magento site backend but we don't have ajax or another apk ruining a poor who you who you used to to this a apk.
rep,so the typer head is done using jquery the search results are based on an api so if they don't need to be ajax you can call the api and then we'll show the results.
prospect,okay the apa restful.
rep,yes it's restful api correct.
prospect,yeah thanks.
rep,no probkem yes i can and i can show you what that looks like this is our magento search implementation and then you can see here pretty straightforward so user query goes to the magento core code and then we have the search extension on the back end your content box we make an api response to the magenta core and then it sends back the results back to the okay so here you can install the extension pretty straightforward very straightforward process you can authenticate singular catalog you do the analytics tracking figure search and we'll help you with all of these and then we'll give you an auto suggest also.
prospect,okay i read these and right now we we think in the demo site you have a demo site - we enter to put information and check in who to use it that's
rep,yep you can sign up and usually go ahead and sign up - let's click here to sign up its search click on that fill out this form yeah that's it you have access to everything that you need so once you install the extension you'll get how do you get the extension key to authenticate you can upload the catalogue you can manipulate the catalogue the back end dashboard would look something like this once you've installed it this is what it would look like you can then define which fields are searchable not searchable you can define what facets you show you can create your synonyms on the back end so the cellular is mobile that can be done right here .
rep,you also merchandise your solution so let's say here's the demo site we put together so let's say i have a dress.
rep,i search for dress this is what the search results look like i want to figure very dress so this is what dress looks like on the back end i can promote boost the results instantly it will start showing like the products you see here yeah. you can drag and drop
rep,i have a question now that we are liking the back end is you said that incorrect and give you suggesting you have like you means misspelled something we need to write like.
rep,correct
rep,you misspelled dress i use one yes or like those three instead or like correct you or give you suggestions like in this case like we need to specify
rep,so here you got it if i misspelled black leather jacket now i misspelled all three words it will give me did you mean black another jacket show the search results for black leather jacket no i mean like that me do you mean like leather jacket i mean do we need to specify that if somebody misses that c in black. yeah the unbox system will take care of that.
rep,if there are some special circumstances where unboxd has no idea how to correct the spelling because it's a unique keyword you can always solve it by creating a synonym on the back end you can go here <> synonym and say that say a particular keyword for example like cellular may get caught up as it's misspelling so you might want to say keyword is synonym is mobile that's it and if you have more than one you can you can add more than one to say seen
prospect,right now that i like that you can use coma instead of like creating one by one.
rep,correct that is correct. yep. alright next thing so we're talking about the merchandising piece right but one piece i forgot to show you is let's say you applied a particular rule to boost you have few products and you just want to drag and drop you don't initially apply a rule you could just drag and drop and say i want to pin this product in this position i want this product in the second position let's say in it and i now search for dress those two products will show up up top the other thing you can do is create custom landing pages for marketing campaigns so let's say is there any holiday coming up in dominican republic.
prospect,i think yes  valentine's day .
rep,okay valentine's day awesome valentine's 2016 let me first search for this it didn't find any results right but this approach can also be used for <> keywords that are producing zero results put a tool click on merchandise you won't find anything in the catalogue you convert to a landing page by clicking on the right here okay now the entire catalogue is available for you to curate okay now come in and say brand whatever we're gonna create okay by the way does it have to be this specific so .
prospect,now i want to now promote by sorting let's say on price and now search for valentine 2016 i actually now see results exactly the way i curated them now you can take this url put it in your email campaigns ppc campaigns social media campaigns whatever the customers click on the link they'll come straight to this page last piece is the reporting so here in reporting you can see we give you three levels of reporting what is the conversion funnel high level conversion funnel second is the search queries top products added to cart who's your top zero results queries and your top clicked products.
rep,the next is you can also drill down into an individual query and see whether it's performing good or not so you can drill down into dress it as a query and see what is the trend line of that query what products show up when you search for a dress and what is the conversion funnel of this particular query and you can also do the same thing with products you can see the individual product you can see it's trend line you can see it's you can see its excuse me you can see the trend line you can see the conversions and you can see that queries that show up for that particular product and that's the solution so i just want to make sure i make sure i don't forget didn't forget to show you something yep that's it any questions.
prospect,this is good this is the information we need in in this in the site back end right now if you consider a you have on other things alex or cecilia.
prospect,well i have a question for customisation i saw that in different web page the search bar show different way like okay we have we have here a button that allows you to buy right away can we customise it or you right away customised depending or like what we need.
rep,yeah within reason it can be customised you can move around so for example if you want this button let's say in the autocomplete okay this button that you want to show if you want to show that you can show that you can show search turns brands categories you can show images products so whatever catalog information that you send within reason we can customize this absolutely as you see we have customised it right this looks at you can see how this looks versus you can see how this looks versus how you can see this looks.
rep,but the components the components are pretty much the same it's just that how you design the component to create an experience is what's critical .
rep,anyways yes so this customer is able in that sense and it's up to your design if you want to change the design it's up to you absolutely up to you you can absolutely do that also by the way do you guys work with <> by any chance.
rep,oh is that your technology company who's going to implement this or you have an in-house it team that will implement this no.
prospect,it's them.
rep,okay and they know how to do it from the back end so yeah that shouldn't be a problem right.
rep,any other questions
prospect,right now no one so far.
prospect,yes so far so good.
rep,okay so what are the next steps of your perspective you guys you are the next steps from your perspective do you guys need to think about it do you guys want to get started do you guys want to find out what the price.
prospect,i like this solution.
rep,thank you .
prospect,yeah right now we need like confirmation - we need to show this so they can approve it first before we can take any decision so you don't have a problem we need the this presentation is a powerpoint or another i said the powerpoint is right now yes.
rep,in the powerpoint but some of these pages are not included in it.
prospect,okay i see here that it's being recording the this session can you send the video.
rep,unfortunately yeah we record this for training purposes so unfortunately i'm not allowed to send that so i do apologize here's what i can do though if you feel comfortable whoever your team that you need to present this to if you would like me to do this demo again if you want to set up a second round of a demo we can absolutely do that i do more than 350 demos in a year so i get more than i'm more than happy to do that i love to do this so if you want me to do this one more time so we do that.
rep,so i'm assuming that you guys need to talk this internally and get an approval before moving forward what else do you need besides the let's say we do another demo what about what are the information do you need in order to get approved i'm assuming price is one.
prospect,yes prices and time to to support if you have support what is their support type and every information to to this area administration area like this.
rep,absolutely so the cost is i believe my team has shared the cost per month there's two costs one is a one-time setup fee that is just simply for us to integrate help you get it set up design different design elements for you and support the quality of team to do the integration and second monthly fee for the product so this the setup fee is about twelve hundred dollars one-time and you only pay fifty percent in the beginning and fifty percent after we go live the monthly fee is three hundred and fifty dollars i believe that's what we shared with you is that correct and.
prospect,three hundred fifty.
rep,us three hundred fifty dollars yep not pesos unfortunately sorry and and it typically takes four to six weeks to implement it can take less time if there's less back and forth it can take a little bit more time if there's some back and forth folks on vacation etc and that's it so that typically assumes six weeks at the maximum and that's what the time it takes.
prospect,okay okay and it will accompany like completely functional.
rep,yeah this is again if the quality of team is doing the implementation i'm assuming they are the ones who's doing the implementation we will design all the elements will support them with all the details that they need and will help them do the integration and yes it will be all functional that is correct.
rep,okay okay i think that's that's all.
prospect,i think that we are going to contact you like via email.
rep,okay no problem if we don't hear that from you say a week from now should we reach out to you and is that alex or sergio who should we reach out.
prospect,alex or sergio or cecilia.
rep,okay i'm not sure who whose voice is whose i still have done that cecilia i got it.
rep,all right awesome any other questions sergio alex cecilia that i did not answer for you guys or that you want to know or new questions.
prospect,okay right now i don't have any question.
prospect,i'm okay.

prospect,marvin do you wanted you you had actually originally well to be honest with you uh kristen and i were shot oregon we talked to a lot of different people.
rep,and i got i don't know ten or fifteen emails from you guys so you kind of roped us in how do i be interested to hear what you think you could do for us.
rep,got it okay all right that's fair and thank you for not getting upset with all those emails we really appreciate your patience and giving us the chance so just to give you a run john can you guys see my screen one.
rep,okay perfect second is we've prepared a quick agenda to walk you guys through all the different elements of what we do but we'll tell you a little bit about us because we didn't get a chance to meet with you guys at shopper or where do we see the opportunity from our perspective our vantage point from looking outside in and what is the opportunity really from unboxd and how do we differentiate and create new opportunities for you guys and what is this technology look like with some examples of current implementations etc is there fair.
rep,is it a fair expectation okay perfect all right so a little bit about us we are a bay area company four and a half years old almost becoming a medium size company and we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the us and we've grown faster than anybody else in this space particularly because of four unique differentiators one is we have solved some of the product discovery problems especially in search that were not solved before we create custom solutions for all our retailers regardless of whether your enterprise class customer or a small speciality site and everybody else in between we also have tremendous capability in infrastructure to scale up and scale out and we're very price competitive and extremely affordable and because of these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we will be the king of product discovery here's some customers that we work with chile just to give you an idea we work with target dot comm and un dot comm in the enterprise scale we also work with bells department store i don't know if you guys know that out of southeast united states out of florida in a billion-dollar department-store so we have these are some of our global enterprises yep and we also work with some pure online brands like web parts shindigs these are all some of our ir 250 ir 500 level companies and we work with a lot of different platforms including custom platforms essentially making our solution platform agnostic okay any questions.
rep,okay awesome so let's get right into the current state of the union as we see it specifically focusing on site search or our conversation today although from unboxd perspective we do influence navigation site search and personalized product recommendations we have products for all elements of product discovery so speaking specifically of site search let's say for a customer.
prospect,are you able to send this document or.
rep,yes absolutely it's like a five hundred dollar charge for time i'm just kidding yes we will be able to sangeetha's no problem kristine absolutely um so you don't need to take notes i promise you to send do this okay i'm assuming that was a question.
rep,okay so i'm sorry was there a question.
rep,okay i thought i heard something okay so the first interaction a customer has with site search is the type-ahead right so today do you guys a have a vendor that you work with or this is homegrown can you give me some idea oh .
prospect,this is um this is on our own platform develop our own developers .
rep,okay so this is a homegrown search solution that you have what ecommerce platform are you guys on.
rep,custome home ground or it is standard looks.
prospect,well it's it's all developed homegrown but it's it's based on gosh what is it i never can remember i'll have to get that to you but it's a it's it's not like a shopify system or a yahoo store or something like that i mean it's our magento it's it's all coded.
rep,gotcha no problem yeah just i was curious about that and the homegrown solution is that based on solar or elasticsearch.
rep,i think it is solar.// okay so this will give me a good idea as to how we can really differentiate so here you can see in my type-ahead i started to type in judy let's say anything from that perspective and there are certain categories based on that and you can see here it shows me julie belt bells jacket jackets etc right the idea here is half of your search suggestions are wasted by duplicates just because you have singular versus a plural problem so i'm guessing based on what i did the analysis on the site is it is a huge catalogue i don't know i can you give me some rough idea of how big the catalogue is how many products.
prospect,eight thousand styles and what is it it probably a hundred thousand or more skus.
rep,got it so you can see that you have tons of products where the idea is not all products will have exactly the same keywords but you want to make sure that when this is where the customer searches for it all the products show up rather they search using a belt or the word belts so in solar the only way to solve this problem solar comes out of the box with some stemming solution but you have to essentially create synonyms on the back end so you'll have to create belt is equal to belts or belts is equal to belt in order to accommodate for something like this so when a customer is searching for juli belt you then also have to create a synonym for juli belts or belt and that's why but solar cannot differentiate a search query versus a synonym and that is why you see these types of search suggestions and also you can see if belts and jackets are the most popular search suggestions the products are only showing t-shirts okay the one on the right you can see here again and this is not a corner case that i found it shows up all over the place i started to search for security badges or security anything and security batons etc and you can see it shows me a lot of badges in the search suggestion again singular plural all over the place but again in the actual products there is no relevance to something like that if just showing some security related products but completely different set.
prospect,no it it is security that's a security poteau a security jacket.
rep,it is security but if badges are the most popular no badges are showing up a spotter.
rep,and so the idea it's not necessarily by the way guys i want to make sure i say this i forgot to say shoes this is not a criticism of your existing implementation just to create to establish an a a parity that we both understand there is an opportunity at the end of this there isn't i completely understand but please don't take it just take this wrong and the idea here is when a customer is starting to search in the type-ahead you want to do three distinct elements one is you want to make sure you control the journey that the customer is going through by making it easy for them to the queries which you're doing in a way second you also want to guide them because you have so many categories and sub-categories this is not guiding the customer to a particular subset and the third thing is you also want to expose them to products that they never would have thought you also carry so there's that discoverability aspect also that type-ahead needs to accomplish which is where the opportunity exists some other example and this is where i wanted to share this with you i started to search the nike and there's obviously tons of different categories of nike products and you can see here it's showing nike as a keyword but it's also showing some custom landing pages that you guys might have created using solar like a october 10th promotion for nike or an october 15 promotion correctly i'm not sure what those dates are i'm assuming that's what those are same thing with if i'm starting to look for rain i'm starting to type in rain there's a tons of different sets of products not just jackets and coats and pants but there's accessories that are related to rain gear that you also want to expose the customer to and same thing here if i'm looking for fire related products there's a lot of different elements so the type-ahead is an opportunity to accomplish something like that the second thing i wanted to also identify is how the type-ahead behaves with different sets of keywords in different for the same keyword in different stages that it's in so i just typed in ste so i'm starting to type in steel toe right so it gives me an idea on steel toe with two e's it stays there but as soon as i type in steel start showing new products but for ste and stee it has it was showing me no popular products even though obviously there are related products to steel and then i started to type in steel toe and certainly the only product that shows up is this t-shirt okay.
rep,this is happening because the way solar parses the data out is is looking at the individual keywords so what it's doing now is for search suggestions it's doing phrase keyword pattern-matching so it's able to show you the steel-toe that you've been seeing consistently but for popular products it's now restarting it by showing a t-shirt because the letter t matched and you can see here as soon as i typing teo it starts to show me some other products including a steel toe so that's another limitation of solar you have to write a ton of code and i'll show you what that looks like ton of code to actually accommodate for what a complete search system would really look like all right you know ahead yes please.
prospect,so what would value do you see and actually even having the type of head i mean i'm of the opinion and if i'm if i'm a clicked in that search box and i'm gonna type in a simple two-word phrase.
prospect,i'm probably gonna have that types before i even see the suggestions anyway it kind of makes all of this a moot point at that point.
rep,sure if you're a really fast typer yes absolutely but not all customers are really fast typers that's number one number two the other piece also is the type of heads function is not just to create pattern matches to give you exactly what you're about to type in if i'm about to type in steel toe boots let's say three keywords or steel or toe boots or blue boots let's say or black boots if i'm about to type in black boots the fact is that it's not to give you a suggestion and saying oh black boots you're searching for black boots now click on black boots that's not the idea the idea is to give the customer three variety of distinct elements one is if i have just typed in black and there are different ways how black can be interpreted based on an attribute versus based on a product type a lot of customers would prefer not to type in the word boots they just see it and they click on it okay a lot of times customers are just looking for category you're not as soon looking for a specific set of product a very unique way to search for a product it's just that they like the convenience and speed of search so they just want to type it in the category but as soon as you give them the category they don't have to type it in they don't have to go through the whole navigation aspect which could get cumbersome the third piece is discover ability is let's say i am searching for let's say security badges lorraine the example that i was talking about great example you might the customer may not realise that you also carry gear or accessories that could help them in a rainy condition or rainy day or they their waterproof etc and while the customer may not have come to the site to buy that kind of product exposing them to that also creates an opportunity where they might be thinking of buying it they don't know that you sell it now they do you'll at least get the chance to earn their business for that particular piece which they might have been thinking of going somewhere else to buy the product and that's the function of the type-ahead it's not necessarily just to help them finish that query it is to get to get them to a category if possible maybe get them to a brand if that's what they were looking for show them some some top suggestions so that they also see what if they're just browsing it also depends the the state of mind of the customer is it a lot of times search customers have very clear intent but that may not necessarily be true they just may be browsing for certain products without intent and in that case you want to expose them to more things than they might have come into this pie so that's the that's the reason what the type of head actually functions and why it needs to be adaptive to what the customer is trying to do now what you see here today what's being developed today is a very standardised way of how autocomplete has been done and i'll show you some of the ways that unboxd has done when we've taken a very different approach the approach we've taken with type-ahead is not necessarily just to expose in a very serial manner what the keyboard pattern match would provide it's to actually guide the customer what galls cells has been sold by a lot of other retailers there's a lot of competition right would you agree but there is the reason why customers come in and buy from you and what is that differentiator that you have and how they buy from you has to be reflected into the search experience so long-winded answer to your question i hope that i answered you a question.
prospect,do you have any metrics as to what percentage of customers began typing something in the search and then abandon that in favor of one of the suggestions .
rep,yes so it depends on the vertical if you are in the apparel vertical the the autocomplete suggestions either product keyword category etc as with about thirty to forty percent if you are in a big department store type setting like target newegg it has been closer to 75 to 80 percent in grocery which is also another vertical that we work in is also even higher you have seen almost 90 to 95 percent at least in our customer example cases where the autocomplete usage becomes extremely poor and i'll show you why that is the case also but it all depends on the vertical i don't want to say one statistic that works for all it's different for different verticals the bigger the catalogue more the in interaction with the autocomplete so we work with new egg just to give you a scale idea work with newegg dot com i'm sure you get a part of new egg it's a four billion dollar pure online play company and they have just shy of a hundred million products in their catalogue that is grounds for tremendous amounts of autocomplete opportunity of our customers just essentially start looking for autocomplete but if you now look at target dot com for example you're still experimenting with autocomplete with them but what we have seen so far is because target is a department store with so much cross categories not as big as a catalogue they don't have 100 million products they have a couple of million products but they have lots of different categories they have almost 500 different sets of categories and sub-categories autocomplete becomes very important in that case too now we have only thousand or two thousand products auto-completed is not as important in that instance the usage does go down any other questions on type-ahead .
rep,okay awesome so now let's look at some how the customer figures out the type-ahead the query and they hit search and or we do the search for them and here's the relevancy aspect that now comes into the picture i'm searching for brown shorts which you have tons of by the way and this is the first rule to load up results that i get my search for brown shorts now why is this happening because and i'll show you some technology differences in how solar operates and why you need to create a contextual relevance in order to solve queries like this but you can see here the reason these all of these might be showing up is somewhere in the description either the word brown or the word shorts show up and i'm assuming solar has been tuned today to do orange which is one of the techniques that solar allows so you can do ring ending or minimum match and that's why it's showing you different sets of results now what happens is you have it's sorted by a most popular so even though the search result contains shorts these other products might be more popular and they also are in this search result they'll start to show about cow.
rep,next is guard uniform so i searched for guard uniform i get only seven results all of them are rain coats and some gloves okay another aspect of that training weapons there's tons of training weapons guns knives etc but only two products show up first aid kits so here's a different type of site search difference i wanted to show you i searched for first aid kits with no space between first in aid and then a first space aid kits by the way the type-ahead gives me both suggestions so if if i were to you can now see if i did first will give me first space aid as a suggestion however if in this instance i didn't use the space and started to type in aid it will give me first aid kit as one of the suggestions also without the space however here's the unfortunate rub if i search without the space i actually get 517 results if i do use space i get only hundred thirty-five results now i've not gone through all 500 1 35 to actually see are they relevant or not but this is a big problem in case 517 is right or eve 135 is right one of them is wrong then this is a problem both search queries should actually give you exactly the same sets of results okay.
rep,next is if i went to search for gloves and then filtered it by men's as a category i get about 114 results but if i search for men's gloves i only get four results so this is the difference in relevancy is to how a customer might search they might use a keyword and use filter they might not use the filter and use that filter in the key word itself the search queries context is going to change tremendously if i search for t-shirts with - t-shirts without a knife and completely different sets of results and all of these by the way can only be solved by creating synonyms on the back end and solar next is spell check so here i search for shorts with the dropping an o and head wear by dropping an a and you can see does not give me any search results again you have eight thousand products 100000 skus there is no way this is a scalable solution where in solar the only way to solve this by the way in solar is again to create synonyms for every permutation and combination that's available okay so you'll have to do shorts without a know without an r without a t without a light all the different types of permutations and combinations and you'll have to do the same thing for shirts because shirts you might drop an eye then how do you decide do you do shorts or do you do shirts spell check do actually show to the customer or jewish or both and it's not a scalable solution i don't know how large the team is in terms of who manages the catalog or solar but even with 8000 products and the descriptions that i've seen and the categories that have seen i'm assuming that that is not a scalable and which is why some of these simple single word misspelling mistakes are not corrected today okay so type-ahead we talked about search results we talked about any questions christine and gentlemen okay i just want to make sure am i talking about relevant stuff things that you guys are experiencing today am i talking about the right kind of opportunity i just want to make sure i'm.
prospect,well i think to remember you know some of the conversation centred around when we were shocked or no we initially started talking about search and you know we kind of left with the impression that we're not we're not necessarily looking for a new search partner right now but there was something more that your company offered and i do remember there being a some sort of site review or something that was that was promised but i don't remember the specifics on what else we talked about outside of search but i know that we it did come up that right now we're not really looking for a search partner i think you've shown us some interesting results of you know why we might need to reconsider that but is there more to what you offer other than you know the site search.
rep,absolutely so the other elements of product discovery is navigation so there's a lot of merchandising attributes in terms of how do customers merchandise today which is also could be a problem i'm assuming your category pages are driven by solar as well so let's say if i go to categories and say go to shirts and then uniform shirts why does these products six products show up up top is there a particular formula behind it or that do you have a merchandising team that actually sits there and decides to say this is how we want a uniform shirts show up.
prospect,well i mean it's obviously based on the most popular default sort and that most popular is is based on clicks predominantly and also purchases so it's just you know kind of a homegrown algorithm that were that we put in place and.
prospect,i don't think it you sober at all right was that right steve.
prospect,well i don't know what so worried is so i'm completely ignorant to it but .
prospect,well i'm not sure exactly how that would be leveraged in in categorization maybe it is i don't know enough about it myself but.
rep,yes so solar acts as a database of repository which also gives you fast search but if you give it certain parameters it also gives you a result set so if you were to say i want all the results for category called uniform shirts give me all the results and all the data and you can sort it by say for a column that might be a popularity score for example that might be a little bit calculated in house.
prospect,right yeah i mean i can tell you that from from you know the 278 products that are categorised there i mean why are our assortment specialist has manually assigned 278 products to be you know in that result set so i don't think that's me you know that's obviously not being controlled by any other means other than you know what gets assigned to that category the sorts on the other hand you know the default sort being most popular again is based upon click activity and some purchase activity and and you know general popularity and as i understand it as you know the the more irrelevant results that show up at the top as they are clicked on less and less they will fall to the bottom and more popular ones force will sort to the top.
rep,got it now i'm pretty sure steve from that perspective some merchants at business rules may need to be applied say for example you have a large inventory of a particular set of products the merchants do want to expose that to the customers to who are browsing through the category page is it there a capability that they had today or that might be an opportunity to do that today.
prospect,i think there would be an opportunity i think originally before we we really expanded a lot of a lot of our sort capabilities we kind of had this the sequencing option but i believe most of our sorts kind of override that sequencing because you know before we had any of this you could go in and you could say look i want you know that sh is 0:32 to be in spot one and ss are nine nine seven in spot we could do that but i believe today it's really not functional because of some of our more recent sorting .
rep,perfect so that's the second piece that i wanted to then bring up is nothing to do with search how can you leverage a easy-to-use back and dashboard i'm tell the reason i'm making a leap of assumption here but because i'm assuming that because the category pages may be driven by solar the merchandising team may not have a dashboard or a capability to actually create that override and if they wanted to create an override they have to go to it because solar is purely an ai t function and it does not contain any kind of merchandising dashboard per se to be able to do those types of functions now it's not just saying so a business rule maybe i want to reorder some of the products or another business rule might be i have new sets of products are coming up right you have this new product there's a certain limitation to how you can expose new products through email marketing or other marketing channels and this is where merchants may come in and say you know what i want these specific set of products to show up and it needs to have the capability to auto decay so i want this new shirt to have the exposure for one week for five days while it's out there or two weeks whatever the case may be and then you want those rules to automatically decay versus in solar there is no such capability and this is again me i'm reaching for these examples the second opportunity here is what i or this is me coming from outside in if i'm buying shirts versus say i'm buying and i'll open this in the new sam buying shirts or i'm buying shorts the filters on the left-hand side you can see today are pretty much the same it's consistent in the order of how the filters show up so i have category brand color price range size etc and same thing with here i will have category brand color size pricing etc the the reason to bring this up is for cat even for category pages or for search pages when a customer is navigating through shirts or shorts or shoes different filters become very important more important than other filters so you actually might want to show four shorts you might want to show size first maybe because you see that when customer is on the category page they use that filter more than any other filter for this category for shoes it might be something else for t-shirts it might be something else for for jackets it might be something else and you have tons of attribution for different sets of products so which filters become more important for which category you can also define that to an easy-to-use dashboard i can show you that also the third thing from a navigation perspective again i and i understand this most popularity score is used we actually take that experience to a personal level so beyond the just merchandising and better experience aspect we personalise the navigation results to a one on one level what i mean by that is let's say for example i wanted to i went to judy schwartz and i either used a filter or brown or some colour filter or i used a particular pricing element then or i search for something and i spend time on a particular set of products we build a persona for that customer and when they come back to that same category page we actually will show different sets of results based on what their customer has done in that session because we believe let's say for example i am looking for you know khaki color looking shorts and if the first row two rows of results is all black and blue will actually show a little bit more packing results we'll mix it in to show more khaki results because we scene and this again is all dependent on business elements that why customers buy from you say for example color they cannot buy this color anywhere else ok i'm just showing this example out i do not know what your differentiators are or uniqueness is but whatever those are we are able to weigh them in order of importance and using that data you can reorder the results when they see the same category so you will see different sets of results i will say different sets of results which should still be over right using the merchandising rules but it does give you the ability to do that and the same experience is also translated into search so the one on one behavior aspect is also translated into search and the collective behaviour of all the different customers is also then implied in to search for it let's say a brand new user and we do that per query and search ok the last thing i wanted to show you is personalised product recommendations so personalised product recommendations today let's say if i'm looking at this khaki i was made this is khaki colour they're shorts or beige and what are the recommendations you may also like that you show here today by the way are these homegrown also or do you guys use a vendor for that.
prospect,we use a vendor.
rep,so i'm not sure what the theory behind this you may also like is there something this is a cross sell widget but you have to think about a customer could be in two different states of mind in on this particular page either they really like this product and they want to buy this in that case how do we come show them some complementary products which is this backpack or this top may be doing but you're right now we were just mixing it in and giving them mixed signals because trying to accommodate for two states of minds right now the second state of mind would be i'm not convinced i'm gonna buy this product i'm just evaluating so if i'm evaluating the only way for me to move forward in my journey is to either pick one of the two options that you've given me or to go back to the page that i was whether it was a navigation category page result or a search result crate and what unboxd has found is that giving distinct options to make it very clear to the customer what path they can take from here on makes it for a best next step for the customer and what i mean by that is if you want to show for a customer who is absolutely convinced they want to buy this cross selling products show them a vision that says cross selling products you may also like these other products that are complementary to what you're looking at if this customer is in a state of mind where they are not sure um how to buy this product give them more options to give them the ability to evaluate alternatives and you do that by separating both widgets into two i mean separating both solutions to two different distinct widgets and that is what we have found and pretty sure everyone has their opinion but that's the one thing that i would say now this is just on the product detail page we also have on the navigation page let's say again now the question comes up is well we want to show most popular because it's data driven which is obviously one a train of thought the merchant may come in and say you know what we have to apply some merchandising rules to show certain product on top and because they have their gut feeling they have their experience and how do we combine both of them well the way we combine is we show category top sellers so we can have a widget right here as the first row that shows category top sellers which can be scrolled horizontally and the rest of the products that now show up are merchandise or are based on a merchandising rule that the marketing of the merchandising team decides okay so you can do category top sellers we can do homepage top sellers we also do cart recommendations and i'm assuming you guys probably know that have that as well so let's say by the way any of these pop-ups once the once you have confirmed that they're of adage card that pop up also can have other recommendations because that's a very strong signal right it's a very strong signal that the customer really likes that product and the state of mind a they're in so now it's pretty clear that we don't need to show them more alternatives you probably want to might want to show a comparable or not compound i'm sorry compatible other accessories or other products that are complementary to that product which is i believe what you're showing here but what if they had clicked on checkout and not come to this page so there's that missed opportunity to show that as well and i'm sure.
prospect,a question would be if you use the pop-up and you were you know at the point the popups they're i mean they're they're their intent is to add it to the cart and if you're showing other product i'd like the person to go ahead and complete adding it to the cart i mean how do you solve for them being able to get back to that product so today we showing something else that they like .
rep,got it so i should clarify pristine it's a good question i'll show you what i mean by that let's say i add to cart and i've not actually go back to the category page it was not the segment where they were still selecting different variations it was after i had selected the variants that i'm interested in an added cart the confirmation pop-up that came up that's the one i'm talking about let's see if i add to cart here not this page so let me click ok got it so that's that's what i meant so.
prospect,so you'r saying that page you'r talking about something.
rep,this is this page this popup pages know about it yes because at this point the assumption is that the product is already added to cart not the other one this one is the liniment.
prospect,yeah that make sense .
rep,okay so that's also the third product that we have it just personalised product recommendations and we have nine different widgets based on different algorithms that look at user behaviour product behaviour and collaborative behaviour to try to figure out what is the right set of products you need to show to the customer and you still also get a lot of merchandising elements on it next say for example you wanted to create a set of theme for example you have security a profession based products right so you have let's say security let's go with that so security uniforms you have those however security uniforms i still have to find my individual tops and bottoms etc could there be a specific set that i'm sure your merchants could come up with and say this is a package you would like to go with here's the top here's the bottom here is the belt here's the shoes here's the badges all of those things and you can create those complete set packages theme sets using our merchandising dash board also you can also create this is the last piece i promise right now you have these recommendations especially for you and you have some high level categories that the customer can get interested in but if your merchant wants to display featured products highlight specific set of products and wants to have total control over what shows up when we can create widgets like that also for them so that's that's the entire set of product discovery suite that we have navigation site search of a personalised product recommendation.
prospect,but very insightful.
rep,thank you i hope i took enough time to answer that question but i just wanted to make sure that while all of these other things are quite possible the reason i focused on site search was primarily because i saw that you probably were using a vendor for recommendations so maybe you were not so interested in switching you probably were doing certain things for navigational i wasn't sure what the back end platform was so i thought what i couldn't tell looking outside in it's definitely an opportunity and i understand you're not looking to switch that either but that's what i felt had the most most opportunity in terms of and what are the other things i wanted to also share with you guys just in case it is we have composition and how we do prices are very competitive and very affordable pricing one of the big is the ability to test this right so let's say you've obviously put in a lot of effort time and effort in to the solution that you have today but the question is how can we make sure that you're not just all all talk we can actually walk the talk as well the question then comes in is how how can we test this so we would come in there's two pieces that we do one is if you we can sign an nda for this if that's what's required we will come in and do a discovery analysis to come up and figure out a way to give you guys an idea of what is possible as an opportunity there it is so here i can show you this example and this is just random number so please don't read into it okay so let's say your current site statistics might be 250000 visits per month that search etc right and you have three percent conversion rate let's say your average of the value is $100 and that's what your current revenue is we would come in based on the analysis if you get access to some analytical data i'm assuming you guys use google analytics is that correct assumption.
rep,okay so maybe you give us a read-only access to google analytics will come up and we'll sign it into you for that we'll come up with what we can say is going to be at least a guaranteed performance improvement okay this is a guarantee and what i mean by that is let's say when if you give us a chance for 90 days we will guarantee an improvement of say 5% 10% we won't come in and say well double it or triple it we're not gonna be stupid like that very conservative what we actually can deliver and what would that number look like from an roi perspective if you do 5% incremental you're making $37000 in incremental revenue for you which may not be material for you guys based on what your numbers are but just as an example that will be the case then we'll also tell you what we believe will happen in six months nine months and a year okay and what would that number look like and our pricing is going to be one price point let's say it's $2000 per month i'm just again making this number up it's true it does not change no matter what our performance is if we do 20% or if we do 10% our price will still be one fixed cost and fixed cost is based on two new factors your catalogue size and the number of sessions that you have per month on an average you're 12 months rolling average of sessions if let's say you give us a chance for 90 days and we do not deliver what we had promised you walk away you don't pay us anything.
prospect,in this price is that includes all the thing we talk about site search product recommendation.
rep,correct so if let's say you only want to try one thing we'll give you just it is it could be a la carte it could be all combined as well there are some customers like i said who have millions of products they're only interested in site search they don't want to do anything else than the only decide search their customers were very few products we're only interested in recommendations we do just that so whatever price we give you will be based on exactly what you're expecting us do if you want us to do navigation site search and recommendations it will be inclusive of all three if you just want us to come in and do one thing they will just for that and we can we can give you pricing for all different variations so you can say you know what we'll start with just site search your miss pricing for that and then when we add navigation and recommendations what will it look like what would the incremental look like like you could do that too so.
prospect,so could you give us that i see man maybe send it to us i'm looking at a rolling 12 months for galls it looks like we're right at 12 million sessions so a million sessions per month and then products i think you said you need a products i think we have currently around 80 600.
rep,now is it possible so i can give you some base price point is it possible for us to get these numbers your current conversion rate overall site conversion and your average order value then i can create this chart for you and give you an idea of what's possible the actual percentage well i think we could buy it we can get you that yeah but we can do the quick math really even know what the pricing is first.
rep,oh absolutely i can i can certainly do that the reason i was asking that is because this 5% or 10% may not necessarily be applicable it may be seven percent or maybe four three percent in your case right and the reason for that is to make sure what is the current performance if you can at least <> conversion rate i understand you'd want to give me average order value because you might think as a pricing might change based on that which is fine which i totally understand give me at least an idea of the average conversion rate that you have for overall site.
prospect,give me just second here.
rep,yeah absolutely no problem.
rep,so for that 12 months for a 2.25.
rep,got it and do you and you guys i'm assuming you guys have some sort of an a/b testing tool or am i wrong.
prospect,we have we have some limited a be testing capabilities that the developers have coded for us and i'm just i'm not that familiar with some of the google analytics a/b testing and and some of the limitations we might have with that we may actually be able to do more with that but i just i'm not that familiar with some of the some of the things and in attempts that we've made to use google analytics for the a/b testing i've kind of stopped me in the tracks because of the way that the testing has to be set up and i'm not real sure how to kind of get through that so i don't know if that's an opportunity or not if we could do some testing through analytics or not .
rep,yeah absolutely so one of the ways that we do prove out that you know so for example if the minimum guarantees say 5% how do we prove that we were doing 5% because we're looking at a slice of the time of the year so a/b testing is the only way to really prove that your own search is producing x percent or overall performance is x percent and when it's powered by unboxd that's x plus 5% and the way we do that is we can narrow the scope down and say okay specifically looking at site search because that's where the technology piece really comes in as the relevancy part we have done couple of options and i can show you what those look like so here's a customer called rods comm they're a catalogue comes out of columbus ohio by the way where you guys based out of just out of curiosity geographically.
prospect,lexington kentucky just a few hours down the road from columbus.
prospect,ha lot of interesting things at the exhibit so it was pretty successful for us so far.
rep,fabulous and before we get started do you have any follow-on questions or things about unbxd that you like to like us to address her focus on.
prospect,i think lot of things we have covered and meeting in irc i went through the presentation that justin put together so pretty clear on that a little deeper dive i might have some more questions come out of that.
rep,great that's good so you saw the benefit of unbxd and how it could apply in your environment.
prospect,yeah i think so i think its sort of some of the automatic understanding you know like where removing some of the manual work this is the offer unbxd gives .
rep,great and since we get a chance to meet at irc they can tell where your roles.
prospect,i'm a ecommerce manager.
prospect,and kel is our vp of sales so he covers ecommerce as well as our marketplaces.
rep,super great and then monel will be going through the demo for you monel are you set all.
rep,yep i probably take another 30 seconds to set this out so can you break should be there in 30 seconds.
rep,yep vicki what platform are you using today.
prospect,<><><>.
prospect,next opia.
rep,great okay we know next opia very well so that's that help.
prospect,you say that with a smile or.
rep,let me just say we know it well and we'll get into the demo.
rep,that's a careful work
prospect,exactly yeah.hey justin can you make me presenter pleas.
prospect,sure just a second.
rep,as you heard that irc it's all about driving conversions and yep driving revenue for you and improving the customer journey so that's i'll be going through and we'll certainly be highlighting on how unbxd we'll be able to help or certainly improve over your current environment though.
rep,all right can you guys see my screen now.
prospect,not yet.
rep,okay see if i can stop and <> okay.
prospect,yep here we go.
rep,ya know again alright awesome okay so i mean you just put this in context okay so i know that you guys talk to just an inch and some maybe some of the other folks who were at the conference again first of all thank you for joining us and remembering us throughout the conference so thank you we wanted to just i'll take 60 seconds to just give you a background of who we are i know you met with a lot of vendors at the conference so just give you a context and some of the details about us so we're a six year old company based out of mountain view california google country we started out with site search into product recommendations and now category pages essentially trying to help a customer who is on an e-commerce site discover products in whatever path that they choose to so when a customer comes to an e-commerce site they have three options to discover products you have your category pages through the taxonomy you have site search and product recommendations that the site would recommend to the customer and unbxd has built individual products to help customers through each of those journeys that they might take.
rep,and we have about 1200 websites globally that use unbxd today about 120 plus customers and brands right here in the us and you can see some of them on the screen whom we work with today and there are three big components that unbxd brings to the table in terms of the differentiator i know you talked about using nex topia today but there are from a high level perspective one is the technology which i'm glad you guys remembered some components of what the automation and the machine learning piece that we bring to the table to solve a lot of the problems that merchants and marketing folks face today . so we solves a lot of site search problems that were not solved before and we've created the technology in such a way that it allows merchants to also influence the algorithms at scale next is the business so we don't try to just give you a templated version of our solution we try to understand your business the industry that you're in how customers are going to to use your site how you want the customers to experience your site and discover products and will customise our solution to base on what your needs are and the last one is a framework it's not that we just give you our technology we install it and then we say goodbye you're constantly involved in your business on a weekly monthly and a quarterly basis where our customer success team is collaborating with your team to make sure that we're constantly working on enhancing these experiences any questions about us so far.
rep,okay perfect so what i want to do is quickly just switch before we get into each individual specific details around the commerce search study that we had worked on for you just to give you context of concept of what we're gonna talk about and i know you guys have this or i've seen this before i'll just quickly go through it just to create that parody so specifically talking about search and the five factors on which we evaluate search experiences relevance never being number one is our customers seeing actually good products the right products next is the auto suggests is the experience guiding them visually and with suggestions so it's creating less work for the customer where the customer uses different variations to the keywords using synonyms using stemmed words spelling mistakes what does that experience look like and ultimately on mobile.
rep,so let's say we talk about you know co2 keg chat systems what does that experience look like in terms of search versus what that looks like through navigation that is a relevance component wine on tab shows no results but you have a category called wine on tap portable beer dispensing again on the left is the search results versus on the right are your category pages results so clearly from a relevance perspective that's what we bring to the table and i'll show you why we are able to bring that to the table next is the auto suggest as you can see here if i search for let's say bar tools or anything any any query the idea behind what the auto suggest should be doing trying to guide me trying to give me an options and engaging me with the product discovery right from the autocomplete will show you some examples of there as well synonym detection.
rep,if i was looking for dispensable cups versus disposable cups what does that look like stem booth was four inch flange were is for double quote flange error corrections bar accessories where i miss typed accessories and how should that be corrected and then again on mobile optimisation is how do we make sure that customers who use mobile either website i must mean do you guys have an app by any chance.
rep,okay so for a mobile website what does that experience look like so .
rep,let's get into that particular piece and i'll okay so from a technology perspective wanted to give you an idea of what are these four things that we do very differently and a lot of the competition out there one of the vendors that you might have talked to you in the same space including the one you're using today don't do anything near something along those lines in terms of machine learning so first is the semantic relevance and i'll walk you through each one of these four so let's get into that .
rep,i picked this simple example for for this conversation just primarily to create a context around how is the technology actually working in its simplistic form so what we wanted to show real quick was let's say if i was searching for a long tail query like women's like jeans what typically you might have seen with next opi or any other vendor is there's two techniques either it's or-ing or ending so it's a strict configuration which is and  or a loose configuration which is or so what it will do is it'll search for women's or white or jeans which alternatively gives you bad results because it might end up showing you women's white jackets or shoes not necessary just jeans.
rep,so when you do strict with ending it creates other sets of problems where it is expecting all three keywords to exist for each product if it doesn't it's not going to show that products with ends up showing fewer products and also ends up showing more zero results pages then the or-ing option again a challenge in terms of relevancy so the last piece some vendors have come up with is what we call they call is the minimum match which is again an or-ing option the problem again is because its or-ing it still has the issue in terms of how it might end up showing jackets just because i'm searching for the word women's white or white jeans so why does this happen the underlying technology that all the vendors are using is an algorithm that was developed in the 1970s called tf-idf.
rep,now to understand what tf-idf limitations are let's say .
rep,if i search for women's white jeans and i got a white top in the top result and the blue numbers are the idea of scores the reason that white tops showed up and and that white top had a higher idea of score than a jeans is because tf-idf only looks at popularity or the rarity score .
rep,i'll give you a simple example let's say let's say you have thousand black chairs in your catalogue and ten white shoes okay thousand black chairs and ten white shoes what happens if i search for white chairs you don't have any but the system will interpret that and say the word white shows up ten times out of a thousand and ten times versus chairs shows up a thousand times out of a thousand and ten times so why it gets pretty rare which means it must be more important so i'm going to show products they contain the word white in it and it ends up showing white shoes now while you don't have any white chairs you still want to show black chairs but not white shoes . and that is the first problem that unbxd solves.
rep,when we looked at some of the examples of relevancy in in that instance you saw that we the different sets of products were showing up just because some of the keywords that existed in those products were given more weight-age but .
rep,that product was not necessarily the right product so what we've done is we've created another layer on top of tf-idf to compensate for the limitation of idea we call it the relevance game and because of that relevance game we are able to push more jeans up top and white tops towards the bottom.
rep,however this is still going to create an issue where if i search for women's white jeans i might still see white tops in the results that even they may not be at the top but they still might be in the result set before i go into the next topic any questions i just want to make sure that i'm not going too fast or any questions i can answer.
rep,okay all right so now i have the result set but the white tops are just pushed towards the bottom so we want to make sure that we exclude these white tops so this is the second piece that unbxd is done.
rep,where we have scanned almost a hundred thousand ecommerce sites built a catalogue of about 200 million products ourselves and trained our algorithm to understand what a product type is versus of what a product attribute is so when we search for women's white jeans it understands that jeans is the product white is the colour attribute and women's is the gender attribute which is why we now can see in the result set that a white top while it's loosely relevant because it might have all the keywords because it might say this woman's like table goes great with jeans so it has all the keywords but in a sense it is a top and not a jeans .
rep,so we're going to exclude it so the white tops now gets excluded and more white jeans get pushed to the top the third component this is the machine learning piece that we introduced this is where we deploy our own analytics on your site and we track every single click that the customer is making whether they are paginating using filters clicking adding to cart orders etc.
rep,we track every single click in data per query so if if let's say customers is searching for women's white jeans it was it's own tracking versus white jeans will have its own tracking versus women's jeans will have its own tracking so every single query gets tracked independently and we build a user behaviour score for the result set and then we've based on that score we've defined which is your best performing product and based on that we reorder the results to show the best performing products up top.
rep,so this is what the machine learning piece does and then the last component is the merchandising today for example if you wanted to merchandise possess specific queries you might merchandise one query is possible that some of the other queries might get messed up that is also something unbxd as falls we normalize the merchandising whether it's boosting whether it's pinning slaughtering etc where it is contained within that query and and i'll show you the merchandising dashboard also just to give you an idea so how easy to use but yet very powerful tool that that exists.
rep,based on this technology we have developed a classification algorithm that has identified up to 12 different types of queries and we've written an algorithm to solve every single one of them so exact search product type of query spectrum essentially gives you an idea of what type of results the customer is looking for .
rep,is it a single product or types of product or not even a product and then query qualifiers are i have i know what product i want but i want some some attribute around it so i'm looking for a black dress or i'm looking for a evening dress somatic searches etc.
rep,and query structure is where customers use different variations to search for products for example the other inch there's double quotes iron iron ch etc a natural language where they might be looking for specific products underneath a certain value so not all of them might be applicable in your world but unbxd has them available and this is something that we found working across the 1200 websites that we powered today any questions on the technology piece.
prospect,no im good.
rep,okay all right the next piece is the spell check before we get into spell check i wanted to quickly talk about the autocomplete because we talked about the relevancy piece so i don't know if you had the chance to see this at an irc or not but what wanna what i want to show you is a few different options very different verticals to give you an idea the versatility of our approach .
rep,so here we have a parts warehouse now parts warehouse has two types of customers one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts to buy so what they used to do is they used to have two search boxes one for parts and one for the appliances or the models of appliances we obviously came in and said you can't do two search boxes one because you're putting the onus on the customer to pick and choose second what is they pick the wrong search box and third you can only optimise one search box at a time so i'll show you in a second here as to how we interpreted that okay so let's see let's say.
rep,if i the first product here is bissell so let's see if i started to search for bissell this is what the autocomplete experience looks like we split the autocomplete into two segments on the left hand side we show parts and on the right hand side we show models and on the bottom we show top searches so it gives the customers from those parts the exact parts that they are looking for if i don't know what parts i can also search for a model of the appliance but then also there's very popular terms that customers usually search for bissell.
rep,we automatically show up down here a very different vertical in apparel for example let's say if i was now searching for a dress here we wanted to make sure that in apparel in fashion world the customers get engaged very very quickly and they should be able to discover products very quickly so as soon as i start to search for dress we create some guidance for them.
rep,we start showing some products but we also provide some options on the right here so that they can narrow down on the results set and as you can see if i hover on each one of these it will actually start to show me results on the left hand side based on what i'm choosing right here and so this way a customer can start the discovery right from the autocomplete you start seeing different options right here any questions so far on this.
prospect,no <> .
rep,or you did okay got it the last option i wanted to show you correctly i'll show you a quick another option just the last option just to give you context and maybe you saw this as well but i also wanted to explain the the reasoning behind building something like.
rep,this so what we built here is for grocery especially in grocery when you have customers buying a lot of products in a single transaction we wanted to make sure that they can quickly get in and get out because the product products that they buy are usually the same ones that they bought last week or two weeks ago.
rep,so let's say if i was starting to search for let's say mayo and i wanted to do what we found is that customers were searching for mainly they were looking for the weight maybe the price maybe the delivery options maybe changing a quantity and then adding to cart so he essentially brought all of those components right here in the autocomplete
rep,for customers who usually don't buy i mean he's it's a rare occurrence we also help them with some commonly searched terms some popular brands on the right it and some categories and.
rep,as you can see here it's not a text pattern match you can see popular brands does not contain the word male in them but they still show up because it's the brand that carries that product you can see the different categories here as well you know it's not necessarily just a one to one text pattern match that if it contains the word letters anyway only then we show it's trying to help and figure out how the customer might be looking to shop for that particular product.
rep,okay all right now do you guys at <> works do you guys get a lot of repeat buying behaviour like maybe you have a b2b customer base.
prospect,ya we have a very good <> yeah i think customers would know what they are looking for <> they know what they buy probably not not as heavily weighted that way like in the example that you just showed us but have that feature .
rep,got it and i think that you know especially your b2b customers maybe they come in and sometimes search using skus and skus or item ids or some number that they are usually used to looking it up.
rep,with you can also find exactly so if the idea is if they start searching with using those numbers you can give them this option to add to cart because they know exactly what they're buying and they can complete their transaction right from the autocomplete they don't know they don't even have to wait for the search results to show up.
rep,all right the next piece was the spell check so today typically with next opia or any other vendor out there with spelling mistakes what you have to do is create a synonym on the back end to solve it and you create a synonym on the back end every single permutation and combination of that misspelling and that only happens after the fact right so the customer is already misspelled it and the onus is on you the marketing and merchant folks to actually go through the reports i'm sorry was that a question.
rep,i just wanted to make sure if there's a question so the onus is on you guys to actually make sure you run the reports you find those zero results queries and then create the synonyms with unboxd 85% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box using our natural language processing .
rep,and we have tested our solution to auto correct up to six keywords being misspelled in a single query and we do three things number one is we auto correct it obviously but we also show multiple options to the auto correction and we take the most optimal auto correction and start showing results our machine learning also keeps track of when customers when customers choose other options and if more customers are choosing the second option the machine learning will automatically switch that other option to be the primary option.
rep,so all of that is done automatically through the system stemming 95 percent of stemmed words like central center game gaming etc automatically solved out of the box you do not have to create synonyms on the back end .
rep,but we do give you the ability to create synonyms so we give you the ability to create it by directional and unidirectional synonyms and i'll how we do that as well but a bi-directional synonym would be let's say we just started working with a company that sells weightlifting equipment and in weightlifting equipment shoes are called lifters no way for unbxd to know until we get into that world .
rep,so you can create a synonym called shoes and lifters so customers can search for either and get good results a unidirectional synonym would be let's say i've been searching for sparkling wine with sparkling wine i do want show champagne but when i search for champagne i don't want to show sparkling wine.
rep,that's when you create a unidirectional synonym we talked about these any questions so far i just some zipping through some of the feature sets i just want to make sure i paused at anything that you guys are interested in knowing more about.
prospect,what is the headquarter search i heard about it.
rep,okay so headquarter search is typically your one word queries or your category quick searches this is where we unboxd philosophy is that you always want a it's not a race to show products to the customers it's a race to guide the customer to the right set of products .
rep,so let's say if i search for mobile here in this customer's example and mobile could mean a lot of different categories that could mean smart phones headphones cases covers bluetooth etc we want to make sure that we are guiding the customer to figure out do.
rep,they mean any of these other products but also show the most popular products down below so the technology is it figures out what are the categories or subcategories that we want to show and in which order of popularity so smartphone shows up first versus mobile screens shows up last and fourth the query mobile so it's a ui interpretation in terms of how we want to guide the customer and how technology enables that.
rep,another example is for a smaller catalogue example okay there we go so in this case let's say i am searching for alexander wang who's a designer makes a lot of different categories of products now if i search for alexander wang.
rep,how do i i can show all the products as a product listing but what we believe the right way to show the products is to group them but still also give customers the access to all the products so let's say tote bags are the most popular alexander wang products so we start with that and i can horizontally scroll to see all tote bags then come shoulder bags can horizontally scroll to steel shoulder bags dresses sandals palms etc.
rep,so that's the idea behind it's again a ui interpretation of how you want the experience to be for that customer and what the technology enables to do.
rep,next is the dynamic filters this is where let's say i'm on a category page for shoes and it's easy for me to define on the category page what the filters and facets are but i can search for shoes in a thousand different ways so what unboxes solved is if you define either manually or through machine learning .
rep,what are the most applicable filters and in the in which order they come in no matter how i search for shoes shoes casual shoes men's shoes.
rep,i can even search for men's nike or men's adidas doesn't even have to have the word shoes in it the filters will automatically show up in the right order of importance for that particular category of products next is variance actually if this is truly applicable to you guys but i just included that in here as well sometimes customers will search for different variances in the query and you if you have the image for that variance you automatically show the image for that variance rather than just a primary image.
rep,here's a sort of an extrapolation of our recommendations engine so let's say i'm searching for shoes and here's the shoes that i see and i like the first set of shoes i don't know why i like them or there might be too many reasons why i like them but i wanted to evaluate other shoes very quickly .
rep,there are similar and we can easily provide a link at the bottom that says see similar products opens up in a modal window we show alternatives if they like them they click on it if they don't they can close it and stay on that experience for that page zero results today or.
rep,zero results pages you probably show some static content to the customer what we believe is that the zero results experience is a big interruption to their flow .
rep,so you want to give them the ability to go back or to go forward so recently viewed gives them the ability to go back and recommendations give them the ability to go forward so you don't want to just show static content you want to show something that's personalised to them based on what their experience has been any questions so far.
prospect,no <<<<<>>>>.
rep,absolutely so let me walk you through the back end okay you can still see my screen yes.
rep,okay awesome so this is what are the homepage of our back-end console looks like as you can see you can manage multiple sites let's say you have dev staging production and if you wanted to keep them separate or.
rep,run some tests on on some of them you can maintain them separately if you have multiple production websites you can manage all through a single account if you wanted to homepage gives you a two-week executive overview of what your search analytics looks like so how many queries did you get in the two weeks how many views add to cart.
rep,how many products were sold what was your revenue revenue per search visit and revenue per search query and you also get a graphical interface just to give you an idea as to you know that things are going normal or are they dipping or is this part of seasonality etc .
rep,next is we give you the ability to create campaign so here is through merchandising let's say i wanted to actually merchandise specific queries etc and create rules you can create three sets of rules you can create a site level rule which gives you the ability to create rules that apply to all queries.
rep,so it's like a global rule what that means is let's say you wanted to not show products that are out of inventory or you you always want to show products that are out of inventory towards the bottom of the search results you can create that rule once and it will automatically apply to all the queries.
rep,next is if you wanted to apply a rule for a specific query so let's say here i'll just go to the dress query maybe it's to meet this one option sorry i'm using the hood i learned that here so it's a little bit slow i'm just gonna pull it again .
rep,okay there we go and i can now create a campaign so what our idea behind this is that whenever you want to override the algorithm using any merchandising rules it's going to be for it for a temporary reason for a either for a season or either for for some sort of marketing campaign or an event that you want to do.
rep,this for i want to just get rid of inventory i want to promote some new products new brands etc so you can put a start date end date around it if you don't put an end date you want this rule to be there forever just skip the end date it will automatically put a hundred years as the end date but you can choose to if you wanted to you can define different sets of rules based on devices .
rep,so you can have different types of product assortment for desktop and mobile etc .
rep,then you have the option three options in terms of what you want to do for merchandising so you can either merchandise based on the result set that exists so let's say here a dress is a good enough query that actually has results but i might have a query that is giving me zero results let's say it was a product that you used to sell but you no longer sell .
rep,so it's giving you zero results you can also create a landing page so though you can start merchandising create a landing page or create a redirect urls if you just want customers to go to a specific page for that query you can do that as well so let's say we start merchandising.
rep,now with in merchandising you have five different options you can boost based on any attribute that you send us in your catalogue so you have your title you have your colours your size your material any kind of attribute that you send us to the catalogue you'll be able to create rules based on that you can also do slotting so slotting is a is a hyper function of pinning .
rep,so let's say for example i want to slot in position 3 & 4 so i can choose the block 3 & 4 and i want it to show products from a specific rule set so i'll just pick something that there's floral i believe i'm not mistaken so floral is one of the attributes so there we go so in 3 & 4 as you can see now i can actually see products based on that rule set so sometimes you know you might want to.
rep,let's say the inventory clearance please so for a particular query you want to show the first two products that are your best sellers and in third and fourth position you want to show products that you want to get rid of inventory then you can do it this way where you can define it based on a rule.
rep,set as long as those products go under under that inventory level it'll automatically replenish it with other products that are so high in inventory and then pinning is.
rep,i'm sure you've looked at pinning from other vendors as well but it's it's slightly different you've made it quite easy so let's say you just want to go in and find the product and say this is the product i'm gonna pin in the 5th position and you'll see on the right hand side the preview.
rep,the top two sellers we've left them as it is third and fourth we've flooded and 5th with 10th and now click next and you can now add a banner either an image banner or an html banner and it published as soon as you hit publish the next set of queries as long as the the date and time match the next query will get the merchandised results.
rep,there we go so here's our a synonym library so this is where you can create very easily your unidirectional or bi-directional synonyms as you can see very straightforward as part of our implementation if you have an existing library not all of them will need it to be ported over like the spelling mistakes etc but if there are specific industry jargons that you want us to as part of our implementation will port them over as well for you.
rep,the next piece is the analytics now one of the big differentiators that unboxd brings to the table is the analytics component see today with your existing vendor or a lot of other vendors they do not give you conversion level or revenue level reporting they ask you to rely on google analytics or any other analytics platform that you might be using today .
rep,what unbxd does is because we deploy our own analytics for the machine learning we also give you reports based on the analytics that we've captured the one big difference between say google i'm assuming you guys use google today is that correct.
rep,okay so within google within google analytics what will happen is let's say i search for something on keg works and i didn't actually get good results so i now go through the taxonomy and navigate to the right category or subcategory i find the product and i buy that product.
rep,what google will tell you is that that search session or that visit with site search had a conversion which is true but unfortunately misleading yes i searched in that session and i bought in that session but those two are not correlated what unbxd does is we do a one-to-one correlation if i search and i don't buy from search that particular purchase does not get attributed to search so you can now actually tell that that query is not performing well right so based on that philosophy we give you a lot of reporting and analytics to to see and get the insights so .
rep,based on any time frame you can change the time frame here and see any kind of statistic whether it's hits clicks cards orders conversion rate you can plot them based on daily weekly monthly .
rep,whether it's a trend or a funnel top search queries top clicked products top zero results queries top ordered products you also get the you can also drill down into queries so you can now see individual queries and what their performance looks like you can see their hits clicks carts orders conversion and revenue per search .
rep,you can then drill down into at individual query so i can drill down into a query called dress and i can see the same level of detail that i saw at the overall level any kind of parameter that i want to plot any kind of time frame that i want to look at look this at but also we show products that are being sold for that query .
rep,and what is their performance so how many clicks did i get for that product how many cards how many orders and then the last one is our type-ahead so there's different components within the type-ahead which component is producing the best revenue.
rep,and the best engagement we also plot that for you and again with a one-to-one correlation so i have keyword suggestions.
rep,what's that performance look like or i have my top queries or popular products you can see here your revenue per search from popular products is almost one hundred fifty eight thousand dollars the engagement is less.
rep,however the top queries the engagement is high but the revenues generating is slightly less than the popular products so this gives you an idea as to which components you want to keep which components you want to embellish not embellish etc any questions on the backend dashboard i'll get into the implementation in a second here.
prospect,no its interesting its functionality and implement so<>.
rep,thank you thank you for saying that i'll quickly go through the implementation piece okay.
rep,so there are two ways to implement our solution by the way what platform are you guys on.
prospect,magento.
rep,perfect so we have a magento plug-in if you wanted to use our plug-in to implement if you don't want to use plug-in because there are a lot of magento customers who use lots of plugins and there's usually lots of conflicts around plugins .
rep,and then they choose not to use a plug-in so we also have an option where you don't have to use a plug-in what we need is three things one is your catalogue feed so the plugin essentially pulls the feed from magento and pushes it to unbxd.
rep,if you don't want to use our plug-in and you already have a product feed that you're sending to other vendors you can give us a copy of that will give you an sftp server you can post it on there a second piece is we need our analytics to be deployed on the site it's very easy just like google analytics.
rep,it's a script that you put in the header and some click tags and that's it maybe an hour of somebody's time and then the third thing is to integrate the search results so search results can be integrated in two ways one is through an ajax method so i'll show you what that looks like so an ajax method would be say let's see if i search for dresses or floral dresses let's say and you can see here on this page you the url is still yours it's still express com.
rep,but you render the header you render the footer you include our scripts and will render the search results starting from here including the filters all the way down to the footer and down here so everything that i've highlighted is that we render and you can see it still looks and feels like express dot com.
rep,this is the faster way to implement because it puts more onus on unbxd team less onus on your tech team the second approach is to use api's where your tech team will have to get involved they'll have to call our api is consume the response and and then show the results the pros and cons to each approach ajax .
rep,the pros are your team doesn't have to do a lot of work the cons are if you let's say do want to change certain pieces to the ui we have to collaborate with unbxd so so that's the only only con from that perspective there's no there's no limitations on speed please to perform our sla of 300 milliseconds or less.
rep,there's no lag or latency in customer experience on the restful api the pros are you have all the control but the con is that your team has to do some of our work to do the integration typically.
prospect,so we can use ajax.
rep,ok perfect so yeah we can use ajax and do it the same way perfect and .
rep,typically the time frame to implement is four to six weeks it could be a little shorter but could go a little longer depending on how much customisation you want us to do and the amount of back-and-forth that might happen to get the customisation.
rep,right and this is what our sl a's look like 99.95
rep,of time 24/7 email and phone support and 300 milliseconds or less in terms of response time and i any questions on that anything that i can answer that i that i didn't mention.
prospect,i don't think so no <><><> it team to get that point might have some more question <>.
rep,got it sounds good anu i don't know in terms of next steps what you want to recommend etc.
rep,yeah vicky and cal where are you as far as in the process are you looking at anyone else what is your timeline for moving forward but certainly we'd love to see you join the unbxd family.
prospect,we are still evaluating couple of other options  you know coming back from irc we are getting setup we are still in the discovery phase part of it will depend at that point our decisions and based on you know cost and return and you know evaluating what we can get out of a new platform and our timeline is scheduled i think you know one of the concerns is you know we're in the project planning stages of moving to magento two we are in magento one now and just making sure you know kind of what we're doing now translate well and kind of factoring that in to that as well.
rep,great a couple of things we are agnostic between one and two you simply can redirect we're unbxd points to and/or you know so there's no issue there so i think we have transparency there also my assumption justin did you send vicky the metrics that we look for precisely and to pull together in our way.
prospect,i don't think we've got to that point yet.
prospect,ok thats great ya i mean i was stand for <><> .
rep,do you have any seasonality you know our holidays is a bigger time thing to that sort.
prospect,yes definitely .
rep,okay so certainly again to say what to repeat what monal said we're for six weeks so certainly very very doable to get unbxd deployed prior to the holiday season so you can take advantage of all the conversion up look that we bring to you.
prospect,yeah so from the thing we would need to put some numbers to it so at some point that's the conversation that we need to here towards raisin right at this point.
rep,when are you planning to do the magenta one to magenta two migration.
rep,until next fall. we are on it
rep,so again no issue with that at all there's no reason to delay start getting the benefits of the uplift and conversion now and then when you do that migration you then you just simply put unbxd on top of magenta to know what no issues .
prospect,okay good to know.
rep,i hope this helps you and gave more clarity behind the unbxd solution and you know certainly our workbench people love it because of its ease of use and i think you see the flexibility that it gives you and the analytics people just it gives them such greater insight as to what's going on.
rep,well if you if you have any follow-on questions please get back to us and justin will send you that email and we'll discuss numbers next week.
rep,thanks everyone for your time.
prospect,thank you thanks have good day.
rep,okay can you guys see my screen.
prospect,yes we do that.
rep,so i nik and i we talked sometime last week and we gave making overview of you know where we are coming from who we are what we do and looking from the outside in what could be the potential opportunity for us to and maybe come and help you guys group chenoweth and nick what we were what i was planning to do today is maybe take a little bit of a deeper dive i'll do the introduction of who we are take 60 seconds for for the two folks for the new tuna folks and the then we can get into the specifics of the product the technology the features and some other components and i'll also quickly walk through some of the examples that we shared last time in terms of the customer experience study so i set the stage of exactly what we were talking about so that sound like a plan is there something i should do differently anything in particular you're short of it.
rep,perfect and obviously i'm gonna talk about a fan so please don't hesitate to stop me if i'm skipping over staff and or if you want if you have some questions i would appreciate you ask me to stop and we'll get into it.
rep,all right so a little bit about us we are a product discovery company what we mean by that is how does a customer discover products on an e-commerce site they can discover it through navigation they can discover it through site search or personalised product recommendation and unbxd build a unique product for each individual journey that a customer can take on the website. we we have about 1200 website globally that you can bar about 120 customer customers and brands right here in north america and here's some of the customer as you can see on the screen we also work with a lot of different platforms and essentially making our solution platform agnostic so including custom platforms we have worked with all different sorts of solutions so any questions on us for now.
prospect,no its good.
rep,ok perfect awesome so the three products that we talked about we site search category pages and product recommendations.
rep,we have done a tremendous amount of effort and and created a lot of innovation in trying to solve automation issues or manual issues and we've automated them we've try to solve some of the technology issues and we have try to automate them as well and  we specifically focused on site search for group dynamic the conversation that had last time.
rep,so what is the immediate impact that unbunbxdox has we use three components machine learning personification and contextual relevance using these three components we are able to create an immediate impact in terms of how customer experiences your search on the site and because of that we're also able to impact the conversion rate and in fact we have a very unique approach to how we do tests and poc's and i will get into that somewhere later in the presentation as well.
rep,okay so let's get into what's the actual opportunity is so let me quickly share the experience study that we did.
rep,there we go so really getting into it so there are five components when we talk about specifically site search there are five components that we look at one is the relevance trying to figure out what is the customer actually looking for what is the guided and visual auto suggest so the first interaction a customer has a search what is it that they are doing what options are we giving them how are we guiding them.
rep,next is the synonyms and stemmed world these are variation error correction to what a customer is actually trying to do but they can make mistakes they can different terms and how do we also resolve for that and the fifth one is applying all of these on desktop and mobile.
rep,obviously everybody traffic is on mobile is growing every single day and pretty soon in most of our customers cases most of the mobile traffic most of the traffic is coming from mobile devices so it has already crossed 50% is that true for you guys as well today.
rep,it is. okay so what we starting to look at from a relevant perspective if i let sisters for jump through okay you can see here on the left these are some of the products that i'm getting versus if i look at on the right i'm getting a tremendous number of products like almost 55 products for wear as well you only have a few products on the site.
rep,if i search for sweater very different search results versus category pages if i do miniskirts i get 96 products whereas only 11 are actually in that category
rep,black blazer. auto suggest for example let's say i'm searching for jeans you can see here that i'm providing some suggestions but i'm not actually guiding in terms of all the different types of jeans that i might have on the type synonym detection you have some synonyms detection that is working but in terms of singular plural very different sets of results that comes up.
rep,if i let's say do camisoles works with cammy very different sets of results if i do error correction if i search for fragrance and made a typo i see very few results compared to what is actually available and again on mobile i don't think that there is anything in particular that is being done on mobile in terms of the experience today i have to click on the search box to open this so this magnifying lens to open the search box but even when i search it's not guiding me to quickly get me to where i really want to go so what are the different components in terms of why should we be considering this type of experience second i'm gonna switch back here okay so to summarise this is not a query problem right you have hundreds of thousands of unique products you have lots of queries each month it's not possible to correct every single one of them and the behaviour is very distinct based on different variances so so personification for example different geographies different devices customers buy very differently how are we going to show the right set of products for right to the query on different variances so that's what unbxd really brings to the table.
rep,we have the technology we've solved a lot of problems that were not solved before and provide that foundation for scale and i'll show you some of these specifics around that.
rep,next is the business we understand the business that you're in we don't necessarily just give you a templated solution to say it appears on a template look like and you can use any one of them we actually customise our solution to what your business is and what's important for your business .
rep,and then the third thing is the framework we don't necessarily implement our solution and walk away you're actively engaged with your team to make sure that we are constantly looking at any business related changes say for example you guys don't carry a particular category today but next year you start using that you're selling that category something that you've never sold before how do you configure search on day one so that it's fully optimised we would work with you now that we know how to sell all the categories but we have a playbook just specifically in tackle these figure out what you leave your doing so that there is no cold start problem on day one your search results for that category we're all optimized.
rep,any questions so far i know i blaze through this but i wanted to just take a pause and p for any questions.
prospect,does make sense.
rep,all right awesome so let's get into the specifics of these three components what is the technology what is the business side and what are the framework related tools that we provide let's start with the technology base.
rep,so within the technology we do for every single query for specific thing we do semantic relevance exclusion user behaviour and merchandising we call it boosting that's a merchandise there's a lot of different components to merchandising today but let's take a simple example if i was searching for let's say in women's white jeans.
rep,i know that a lot of your products might be related to one gender but let's assume this for simplicity case we want to try to show how complex the queries can be and what is it that we're bringing to the table so when i search for women's white jeans today everything in the market that's out there whether you're using a inbecka solar or any other elastic search doesn't matter what tool you're using you have one of three outdated techniques to actually solve for this query you have orange through my search for women's or white or jeans which is a problem because you might end up showing why choose white jackets then you have ending we have women's and white ending this is also a problem because some products may not have the word all keywords so it will actually show you very few results and in some times it also ends up creating more zero results pages for you.
rep,then the third technique is minimum match so it tries to pick any two keywords it starts to show results but because this is still doing an or-ing you still have the problem of ending up showing wrong such a result.
rep,so today i believe that depending on what configuration you're using one thing looking from site heading in its set to be doing an or-ing big which is why we see a lot of different sets of products is that correct is that a correct assumption.
rep,and you guys use solar on the back end or do you guys useother technology on the back end.
prospect,we have inbecka.
rep,you have inbecka got it so in inbecka you know you have like loose or strict configuration or as a minimum match configuration right so i'm assuming it's set to something loose is equivalent to an or-ing so from that aspect let me quickly show you why that is happening. and what is it that unbxd is actually coming in and fixing so inbecka solar elasticsearch all of them use a a algorithm called tf -idf that was developed in the 1970s their base algorithm so to demonstrate the limitations of tf -idf let us do a search for women's like jeans and i see this white top and the blue numbers are the tf -idf scores now why is that a white top getting a higher score than a jean is because tf-idf only gives you popularity or their rarity score what that means is let's say you had a catalogue with thousand black chair and ten white shoes just making that up to 8000 black chairs and ten white shoes now let's say if i searched for white chairs you don't have any but let's say i assume i spiritual white chairs what if i didn't look at it and say i see white shows up only ten times out of a thousand and ten time but chair shows up a thousand times out of a thousand and ten times so why it's pretty rare so i'm going so which means it might be more important so i'm going to show products that have white in it up top so it ends up showing you white shoes instead of chairs now even though you don't have white chairs you still might want to show black shirts you might want to show a message to say we don't have any white chairs but here's some black shirt you definitely don't want to shoot shoot and that's what tf idf does and that's why we can take out a lot of times you see a lot of different sets of products and you have to manually fix the relevancy by using their merchandising.
rep,so that is what unbxd falls at the first level we add another layer on top of tf -idf called the relevance game which actually distributes the right amount of weight-age to the right keyword so here we see that jeans in tf-idf as the least score but in reality for e-commerce jeans has the most important shoe have the most important score and then women and then white right so what then happens is after we apply this relevant stain we actually start showing jeans up top and white top to bottom so those white sharks are still in the result set.
rep,so when we do the step to where we do the exclusion we've scanned almost 100000 e-commerce site build a catalogue of almost 200 million product and we've built a algorithm that tells the system which is a product versus which is a product attribute .
rep,so for example when i'm searching for women's like jeans that will know that jeans is a product white is the colour attribute and women's is a gender attribute so it ends up excluding white tops because it understand that white top is not jane so we removed white tops out of the search results and if there are more jeans beyond that we'll start to show them up top the third component we do is the machine learning team this is where we look at the user behaviour and start ranking the results based on the better performing product so we track every single click stream data and provide a score for that query or every single product and based on that scoring we actually reorder the results based on what's really performing well .
rep,and then the last piece of the merchandising so today if you want to override the algorithm you can specifically create merchandising rules that are narrowed down to that particular query with inbecka a lot of times what will happen is if you fix one query some other query will actually get broken and there's no consistency in terms of how and inbecka might work across the board but with unbxd we normalize the merchandising so when you apply to your particular query it stays within that query and does not impact anything else .
rep,any questions guys.
prospect,no we're ok.
rep,all right okay no i just wanted to make sure that did that make sense is that something you guys see as the challenge so this technology overview actually makes sense from that respect i just want to make sure that that is we are along those lines of what you're expecting.
prospect,yeah <> makes a whole lotta sense.
rep,got it perfect the next component is using this four-step technology what are the different types of queries that we've actually solved so we have seen up to 12 different types of queries that an e-commerce site could see now not all of them might be applicable to you but this is what we've seen across our 1200 customers or 1200 website as to what are the different types of query you can see and we've grouped them and written an algorithm to solve every single one of them now we don't solve it how 100% and i want to say this upfront because relevancy is something google is also struggling with so i don't want to come in and say that we solve all queries at 100% but we move the needle very close to hundred percent.
rep,the next component is the spell check so today to solve a spelling mistake the way you can solve today within inbecka is you have to create a synonym on the back end and you have to create a synonym for every single permutation and combination of that misspelling with unbxd 85% of spelling mistakes are solved out of the box .
rep,and it's not because we have created a library of synonym on the back end it's because we use algorithms to figure out is a customer draw two letter transpose letters we also use the neural networks to figure out if we provided a correction to a spelling did the customer actually interact with that result if they did the system remember that the correction has actual some interaction if the customers don't interact and start to research again because the system will also remember that and start to provide different sets of correction.
rep,stemming again variations in spending you have to create a synonym on the back end with unbxd today 95% of spends word automatically solves out of the box.
rep,and we use natural language processing to figure out the root of the word and to solve that automatically .
rep,however we still give you the ability to create synonym so there might be some industry jargon something that you have a very specific use case in terms of product lines that you have there are very very specific to you that something on bus is not encountered before in those instances we do give you the ability to create synonym .
rep,and we give you 2 types of synonyms or three types of synanon sorry bi-directional synonyms and unidirectional synonyms.
rep,so by directional synonyms are where no matter what keyword i use i want to search for both keywords and show results unidirectional is.
rep,i'll give you a simple example and here i think it's tote bag versus handbag so if i'm searching for handbag i also want to search for tote bags but when i'm searching for tote bags i don't want to show all handbags.
rep,right so that's a unidirectional synonyms let me get into some other use cases any questions while i do some context switch here.
rep,no ok alright so let's get into some of the autocomplete stuff what i want to show you is different examples of what what are the different variations that we've created just to give you an idea of the words totality of approach when we come in and say we gonna do a templated solution we do something customised what does that really mean so here's an example of a customer called parts warehouse they not your vertical i get that i just wanted to show you some variety of example parts warehouse love sells parts for appliances there are two types of users one who knows exactly what parts to buy another who has no idea what parts but they know the model of the appliance that they have the parts warehouse used to have two search boxes to solve for this one for parts one from model.
rep,we actually came in and said we can't do that one because they're putting the onus on the customer two what is they picked the wrong search box and three you can only optimise one search box at a time so we ended up doing world let's say i pick the cell right here up top the autocomplete that we create actually splits the results into two segments left-hand side shows part and right-hand side shows models and we also provide some pop searches related to the sell.
rep,if we're now going to say the apparel vertical or fashion here is express let's say i search for dress you can see that i can start showing different sets of dresses in different varieties now in here the idea is you have a lot of in fashion you want to engage the customer so you have a lot of information but also big images right up top a lot i'm sorry was that a question .
prospect,no our just no just discussing about an express some other stuff is you show me.
rep,got it okay the other part is we are showing some guidance here i'm your guiding down to specifically show what different types of dresses there might be in the catalogue that we want to show you but now let's say if i did jeans you can see here i'm showing jeans for women for men also this is in dress i was only showing four women because there is no dresses for men unfortunately and we also provide some popular queries around it but as you can also see i can quickly cover over any of these direct suggestions and see a different set of result set.
rep,i'll show you one last example again this is a very different vertical but grocery what we did here was we wanted to show in grocery world you want to buy a lot of different products very quickly typically online grocery sells 35 to 40 products in a single transaction for this customer is used to take about 100 to 120 clicks to buy 35 to 40 products by creating a ui like this where i can start showing results and add to cart right from the autocomplete because most of the products are repeat product repeat behaviors i was able to narrow down for 120 clicks to about 40 to 45 click by 35 to 40 product any questions so far.
prospect,i have a question actually it's very interesting piece of ui but i was wondering what kind of data do you need to actually be able to fetch those products because do you base yourself like on product description or is it like on product attributes to be able to pull them out when you like make a research.
rep,so there's two ways we do that that's a great question because the if you think about the approach i sell the idea behind that is you have the catalogue based result set but you also have the machine learning and customer behaviour based result set.
rep,so let's say in express i had for jeans i had i had a lot of different options but why am i showing jeans women women or jeans women up top is because while you have that in the catalogue customers are searching for that specifically or customers are interacting with those responses main more which is why they become at the top so it's the type of data we use is two fold one is your catalogue it comes from the title it comes from your categories or your cat level for cat one cat two cats three level organisation your attributes also if you have that so it tries to figure out based on what the customer could be searching for what you have in the catalogue and make some suggestions but over time the machine learning component starts to see what customers are searching for what keywords are they using and starts to make recommendations based on that.
prospect,ok i understand but that means that we have to have like some categories set up for all those product and like actually complete description of those product and then once we pull up the products there gonna be some intelligence showing like the first product first depending on user behaviour but still you have to gather the data somewhere first.
rep,so the way we do our integration is let's say you give it your catalogue i'm assuming you have an existing catalogue and we also integrate the catalogue and then we deploy our analytics first while we are doing the designs of the autocomplete or designs of the search results and configurations we take the analytics live first so that the so that the system is starting to learn the user behaviour data so when we are ready to go live we at least have two three weeks worth of data already under the belt to start making those suggestions.
rep,okay so does that answer your question or i didn't capture the question.
prospect,very it's just that i'm just wondering what kind of level of information we need to have something that's smart you know just have the right product being pulled up by research like if i search for jeans right now i'm not necessarily going yeah all the jeans because they're not under all this category for instance so that's.
prospect,it be fixed before we can actually add some more intelligence into it .
rep,right so i think what we see from the catalogue you have today you know the idea behind that is if we were to take the catalogue information that you have today that should be good enough for us to begin with it and then we can also start providing results based on we can also start providing results based on the actual usage of the catalogues and then give you the idea also to say look.
rep,let's say you sell jean and customers are searching for blue jean okay and you don't have blue as a colour at all in your catalogue let's let's take an extreme example something like that okay.
rep,so what that means is we'll be able to solve and say well customers searching for blue jeans jeans is a product we do see but we don't see blue so let's at least show some jeans so we'll now be able to come and tell you to say look customers are searching by colour so let's make sure that we have colour is an attribute data that you can add to the system to the feed that you're sending up.
rep,so hope.
prospect,it's not larry eventually because we learned that we need that attribute .
rep,exactly you got it so we start with the data that you have today and then we start working towards what data are we seeing what type of queries customers are interacting with and then give it to say look this is what we are able to solve because we have the data this is what we are not able to solve because we either don't have the data or even if you look at our extended data enrichment system we can't seem to see what this data will really look like.
prospect,okay so you will provide us with site on what categories we should add .
rep,that is actually correct that is part of the you got absolutely correct we might not only provide insight and let you finish the question.
prospect,no no that's fine i just get i just said yes it's fine.
rep,no no got it so the idea behind is what we call is the framework piece talk about the technology business and frameworks the framework component is exactly that because search is not a one-and-done solution it is a ongoing work in progress our technology enables you to get to a certain point let's say york today at 50% and we take you to 85% out of the box but we want to go to 95% that activity to go to 95% is a collaborative work you know your business better than we do but we know extremely well how search functions and what we need to do to make search work really well so collaboratively on a weekly monthly and quarterly basis will work with you interact with you in say a scale this is what we see we're able to see these queries and here's some issues we're able to solve those issues automatically here is some issues we're seeing we're not able to solve those automatically because we have some context that's missing from a business perspective and then you can provide the guidance and you can say got it let us give you this data to solve that or why don't you guys do this and that will be a good solution for this particular problem and then we'll go ahead and implement the solution solve it or get the new data and it will the system will be able to automatically solve it.
prospect,ok that answers my question and just had one more question .
prospect,which you guys inbecka we still use inbecka is it something that replaces we still use inbecka it's like an embryonic.
rep,i got it so it could be both ways if you because today you might be using inbecka and there might be a lot of processes that might be ingrained using inbecka that you cannot that it's a big project in this field at all so we can sit right next to and check out together so you can continue to use inbecka after all the other process p and we can just come in and help you solve your search challenges in the future what we have done in some instances like hsn.com or bed bath & beyond.com they used to use inbecka which completely replaced inbecka but in a but not from day one there was a transition process where we came in and started to solve specific and then over time they realised that we can do everything with inbecka we can do it with unbxd do we need to maintain two system.
rep,so both options are available depending on how you guys and what is the impact on on your team.
prospect,okay because i understand there's a learning curve to because like machine has to learn so at some point it's going to be intelligent enough to be 100% on the side but like until then we would meet like both systems.
rep,absolutely and you can continue to do that in the beginning absolutely.
rep,yeah absolutely alright any other question there was a great question.
prospect,no i'm done thank you.
rep,sure another option is also something today that you might be doing manually it's setting a redirect rules for let's say a customer searching for on your side something very specific let's say they're turning your bottom.
prospect,no yeah answer my question.
prospect,yeah so so the so i mean we're interested but if you could accelerate the pace a bit because we've got some emergencies here happening so if we give yourself seven more minutes is that enough for you.
rep,sure yeah so what i wanted to do i'll quickly tell you what the next steps were there's more features to in automated redirection dynamic filters the variants solutions so if i'm searching for a specific color and a product or a size and a product you want to make sure that the right size and color shows up up top in terms of the images color variances how do we help expand the discovery process by providing recommendations mobile what do we do specifically on mobile we do recent searches trending searches also personalized because mobile experience is going to interrupt a lot how can we make sure we show the right sort of products very quickly.
rep,and we also have a lot of merchandising component so you can do brand promotion seasonal promotions new arrivals higher marketing product inventory clearance we can do boosting slaughtering painting etc through a merchandising dashboard that we also provide once want you to sure our sla what's our up time 24/7 email phone support and also wanted to show you what what does an integration would look like how easy or difficult is that integration . so today if you're using thank you and you might go to your poc you can do a quick in page ajax into inbecka integration where similar to what express is done if i search on express let's say i search for jean and i'm showing gene so here you can see which has expressed renders header and renders the footer we render everything in the middle but this way you can split test maybe test our performance versus inbecka 3 which one is performing better over time and our poc model we also provide a guarantee of uptick in conversion try for 60 days if you don't see an uptick in conversion guarantee by the way do not pay us walk away no questions asked.
rep,and that's it that's that is essentially what the conversation was all about.
prospect,ok but does that way please or category page in terms of interface.
rep,you can also do category pages absolutely category pages we have a yeah go ahead what was the question.
prospect,no it doesn't replace is our accountant no.
prospect,yeah ok.
rep,no it does not replace our content no.
rep,no it does not replace it just only enhances in terms of what you're trying to do from it specifically say it product discovery component.
prospect,ok it's fine.
prospect,ok and just to give. its ok. you because i missed part of it but so when you do a search one of the things we have is that we have items and if items are not available in stock you might not want to display them.
rep,yep a very easy way to do that is you can go into our search dashboard you can set up a a rule a site level rule we call it a global rule and you can go in and filter and say if a particular value and you can see rules based on anything i don't want to show products that have inactive or i don't want to show products that are out of inventory you can set that rule one and the search system will automatically not show those results.
rep,sometimes you might have two types of other stuff and other stocks that you will replenish so you still want to show it but you might want to just demote them so bury them in the search result and sometimes you have other types that you'll never replenish and you don't want to show them at all you can do that kind of configuration also.
rep,and you set it up once and it will apply to all query.
rep,any so from a poc perspective you guys use any ab testing tool today.
rep,is it like optimisy sitesearch or.
prospect,yep optimize.
rep,optimize perfect so what you can do from that aspect is if you wanted to test today let's say on dynamite i might search for let's say and today it goes to you know slash search you can create a another page called a slash you search and give us the the header and the footer included scripts on that page so this approach minimise the impact on your team all you have to give us is your catalogue feed integrate our analytics which is also very simple just like google analytics to integrate tasks and you give us a page with search results and then you can split the traffic between search versus u-search and see the performance of the of the sessions and say which one is performing better in terms of search.
rep,so all of this activity takes roughly four to six weeks to get it up and running and then you can test for 8 to 12 weeks however much time you need and if you don't improve the conversion don't pay.
prospect,so the test would be without any cost that's what you said.
rep,so there is a cost a small cost and the only reason to make we asked for a little bit of money is we used to do it for free in the past so what we found is that a lot of times customers will have multiple projects going on at the same time and if you don't charge some amount of money will always get deep prioritise and we do ask for a little bit of money i'm sorry whats that.
prospect,so that moving forward after what it is must be volume based cost right.
rep,correct so for the poc there is one cost and that's it that's all you pay for the entire 60 days or 90 day period which includes the set-up cost also and if you want to continue after you decide to continue you pay a monthly fee.
prospect,based on volume.
rep,based on volume i absolutely and you if you give it some idea on what the volume is all we can give you what that cost would look like and we can sign an nda if that's what's required for us to get those numbers and i can we can follow this is email which with the request on some numbers as well.
prospect,and the volume would be in terms of sessions.
rep,sessions exactly so it's engine yep exactly search session not necessarily search query just search session.
prospect,so so let us do a group together and we'll let you know so the team hasn't got to go here so i loop with the team afterwards lets been search for next steps.
rep,absolutely no problem would thank you so much everyone for your for the opportunity for your time i'm sorry that you have to go up in an emergency but we really appreciate the time and please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions that we can answer and make it a follow up we'll just send you those questions so whenever you guys are ready and and can share some data we'll be more than happy to work with you.
rep,is one question nick what is a good time to give you guys time to internally discuss and then so we start bothering you again.
prospect,early next week.
rep,early next week perfect thank you so much.
rep,thank you everyone really appreciate the time.
prospect,make sure we know what we're talking about here.
rep,absolutely john so yeah you know maybe you can help give us a quick context as well and see if it even make sense for us to be talking so yeah i did take a look at the information that you passed on to abhishek and you know first thing you know on your side i do see that you're using you know google site search today and.
rep,just just curious how does that been working for you.
prospect,it works okay i think that the results are accurate but not particularly controllable so some of the newer search tools we've been looking at obviously have a better looking result page and and or you know have a automatic response as soon as you start typing in a phrase this is nice but it's also good because it's only 250 dollars a year and considering that we hardly enough don't really have much in the way of searching going on on our site i mean it's according to our analytics we're only getting about three and a half percent up let users using search at least within our own site you know we you know the people are coming in driving in from google's itself or from other sites that's a drive traffic to our sites .
rep,okay and you said it's two hundred and fifty dollars a year that you're paying for the google site search and that.
prospect,yeah so i mean okay one of the first things we have to know is like what does it cost for unbxd.
rep,okay well you know so you know so maybe we'll get to that but right upfront you know you're not as cheap as two hundred fifty dollars a year you know that's something i can i can tell you right up front it you know i'm sure you know you're evaluating other search solutions as well and and you know we'd probably be more competitive in lines of what they have to offer in terms of pricing but not necessarily with the google site search and you know if i remember correctly i you know i also remember seeing an article from on google specifically on their site search product being being discontinued and you know now it's being made free with abs on it is that something that you're affected by as well or is that difference with with which you haven't been yeah.
prospect,we have we i mean because we didn't actually renew our contract with them before or the end of last year we're going to run out as a view first so yeah we can't use it with their ads on it because otherwise we have our competitors advertisements on our site .
rep,totally yeah that was the first thing that came to my mind so june 1st of the timeline okay and and do you have a course of action in mind for you know what will you plan on doing once it sunsets you gonna be leveraging another vendor are you planning to do something in-house or how's that gonna look like on your end.
prospect,well we're looking at a lot of different options for search goes you know and you know i think that right now we're actually demoing something called swift type and another one called add search.
prospect,and there you know we've looked at a bunch of them i can see that the price ranges from you know but maybe $100 a month for 250 or 500 dollars a month or something like that so yeah i mean i think that at this point it doesn't really seem to make sense for us to be paying you know $250 a month for a search because we're just not gonna uses that much and the other thing is that i know that a lot of the new search engines probably like unbxd have a lot more capabilities than what would be included in google site search but on the other hand because we're not a magento site or something like that we're probably not going to be real able to take advantage of this i think so.
rep,sure sir you know just just in that line and in terms of unbxd with respect to the platform you know our solution is platform agnostic so i think on your mail if i remember correctly you said you're evaluating shopify or is that you know that certain that you're moving with shopify soon.
prospect,yeah i mean actually we do have a site up on shopify where we're gradually migrating content over to it but that's not really we're real primarily using that because we can also integrate that with our our brick-and-mortar store inventory system.
prospect,so and with a point it also includes you know integration with the point of sale it's one of the reasons why we're using that one there's opposed from the others also it was relatively easy to implement but we probably have there we can't i mean it's gonna be a quite a while before we're able to really move the whole site over to shopify because of the way they use templates and so we would have to we have we have not been able to get a relatively primitive which possible to do with templates ourselves and you have a more complex site and yeah i mean our problem is we our ambitions are the same as like target but you know our resources the same as a little you know 400 thread store so .
rep,totally. you know .
prospect,one of the reasons why we're using a hand-built site right now because we can do a lot with it and it's working really well for us but you know right now what we need is we need some kind of a search engine to plug into that which will tide us over i suppose and so we could you know move on to a different platform stuff.
rep,got it yeah so you know with respect to the way we integrate here so we're platform it's not stake and we can either work with you know a custom platform that you're on today or even with any of the third-party ones like shopify or big commerce or any the other ones out there and so so just to give you a little background to unbxd than who we are you know i'm not sure how familiar you are with the technology so we're a seven year old company founded out of bay area and unlike most search vendors out there we apply advanced data sciences and machine learning to essentially help connect your shoppers to the products they are most likely to buy so one we are ecommerce context-aware and using the algorithms specifically around that we help make it easier for your shoppers to find the products they are looking for and to also help optimise that overall product discovery experience now you know post junes that looks like you you are potentially evaluating a search partner and you know so i know you said it's not a whole lot of the present age is shoppers using searching inside is very minimal today but do you see that going up and you know i was looking at your side and i'm thinking one of the reasons a lot of people may not be using searching inside and just to be very candidates most likely because they haven't had an optimized experience because today i know i see to you guys when i search for a product.
prospect,right oh they're a well i mean that's where we're in the process of basically shifting the entire site over to a new design that's one of the things and so the newer design is the one you see on the top levels and the old design is the one on the lower level so yes i mean it's definitely not ideal the signature that on the new the new design search is much more prominent it works on mobile and so you know on the old one it was not as obvious we'll find it i know so that's obviously that's probably one of the reasons and i imagine that you know we had a better search and everything was better that's more people would probably use it but on the other hand i think one of the things i think.
prospect,i don't know if it simplifies our need is that most people who come in have a pretty good if they're going to search for something they have a pretty good idea of what they're looking for we have a lot of people who come in from another place as they've searched at google or they've come in from another third-party site whether they're coming and looking for a particular yarn and maybe even a particular colour and so then once they they get there they might then they start you know bouncing around looking at other stuff probably one of the biggest changes that we would like to see implemented would be that when someone could search for something that was a little bit more general which is probably what you know we would expect to happen behaviour wise on on a search would be that they we would have a results page that looked more like a collection of photographs as opposed to a list of text responses.
rep,precisely
prospect,and so yeah eally that would happen within our own template as opposed to a pop-up page so we know i mean if you could do that then you probably would be more results from search i mean at this point because we're not tied into a database we're not necessarily gonna be able to track you know whether or not those searches turn into sales right and we sort of can tell that but you know not not easily with our you know with a current system we have set up so.
rep,okay and then you guys used to track it is it google analytics or omniture or that.
prospect,yeah we use google analytics .
rep,google analytics okay got it so yeah i think you know the one thing that we can totally do for you is certainly get consumers to the right products so you know like like you mentioned this is one of the things that we've noticed i'm not sure if it's the thing with your business you know i'm not a huge nipping or yarn enthusiast but working with some of the other retailers we typically see is that people that use site search and a particular site is three times or two two times or three times more likely to convert then the shoppers who browse through your site or navigator ya don't see a site search so there's and that's just because there is such a strong intent of the shopper trying to find that particular product gather information and make that purchase.
prospect,sure so yeah i mean logical.
rep,right so you know so the one thing that you want to make sure is you know for customers coming onto your site you know maybe today it's a very low percentage but like you rightly mentioned you know if you can show them relevant products to their search queries there's a good chance that more and more people would leverage site search versus you know going through the navigation and trying to find a product you're looking for just because .
rep,you know like you said most of your customers know what product it is that they're looking to buy and and so it's much easier to get get to the result page through search versus having to go through multiple clicks and pages before they could get to what they're looking sir.
prospect,i mean i i mean i know that and in fact i'm i was really surprised to see how lower percentage it was and i went back in time to see if it had changed my scene it hasn't them is i was kind of really surprised because i know it's my own experience you know it seems like in the old age people were much more likely you searched them on navigation so but whatever that's what it is so i mean one of the things i guess one of the other big questions but i'm not concerned about with unbxd is there's there's several different kinds of search one of them is called a hosted search right where you can basically just use where the search all sort of takes place on their site as opposed to our site and i think that is that what and so it's also very easy to implement where basically you're you're basically just pulled you're scanning all of our pages and then creating a result based on that as opposed to having a product feed and at this point we sort of have a product feed that we use for google shopping so we don't we because we don't have a database we don't have a real product feed right so does your system require a real product feeds.
rep,so what we you know some time thinking you have the catalogue correct and in terms of the feed so catalogue with all the different products and listening if all the products etc.
prospect,i yeah i mean i gave you i kind of an attachment it was just one of our vendors that you can see you know what we send to google shopping and you can get an idea but we have it safely with the list of the product that they appear on an individual page and for the most part each product is on a separate page so in a way we have a product feed but it's not the same thing is what you're probably used to looking at which is much simpler cleaner .
rep,okay well yeah so as long as you know that there is some sort of you know a product feed in terms of the catalog well that's all we need to implement our solution so you know we can work around that piece in order to deliver back relevant results from from the product feed that lets you provide us with let me ask you this john so are you able to join the gotomeeting to their ways i can show you some examples if you know some of the things that we are you're helping customers with and then see if it makes sense for you.
prospect,let me see i'm trying let's see i guess i don't i'm already on the phone i don't need audio right
rep,yeah you you could you could .
prospect,mute.
rep,yeah i think it takes about a minutes before you could see.
prospect,okay i mean at a in express.com page
rep,okay great so there's a couple of things that you know we're able to do for you is one is the auto suggest piece which i don't think you guys have an autocomplete or not to suggest today on the site but if that's none of the things that you're looking at you know especially just because it's it's the first interaction with your site when i when a customer comes and looks through a particular product and so i am.
prospect,familiar that and i think that i mean pretty much all the search engines that are up there today all the new ones are are just have that so yeah i mean i assume that that's a given .
rep,right and and something that we were able to do is not just the autocomplete but also help visually guide the customer to the product that they're looking to buy so you know you know yeah i know this is a different vertical unfortunately i don't have a yarn selling customer to show you it you know maybe i can show you a few different examples so that way you have a good idea of the customisation that we can we can do and you know how it could perhaps maybe work for your business .
rep,so here's an example where i type in blue jeans and you would notice that you know as i hover over you have blue jeans for women blue jeans for men and and then you have you know blue jeans and skinny and legging which pretty much is the popular fitting that people look for and this is dynamically generated where you know so .
rep,we understand using our analytics that you know skinny fit is one of the popular terms that people look for so we want to put it up top on the auto suggest and and similarly with legging and as you hover over you're able to see there from images and makes it easier for the shopper to write the product they're looking for and
prospect,and i mean i think you know one of the where let me just interrupt you a second because i think one of the challenges here i mean with this i've seen this with a lot of different search engines is that i think that they tend to be using these kind of models like shopping for clothes for instance which are really it really has a different kind of a behaviour patterns and people shopping for yarn so that's one of the hard things i think for a lot of the search product we looked at it as sort of a think in terms of adapting themselves with different kind of us an approach so.
prospect,go ahead we have to keep .
rep,okay yeah i'm thinking so you know when you say people shop a lot differently you know what's the typical pattern like they do they look for you know cg do they look look for yuans based on brand or.
prospect,yeah definitely yeah.
prospect,a lot of times are coming and specifically for a brand and a lot of times then they're they're looking for a particular product because a lot of times what happens is they've read about this on another site somewhere that those comes and your semantic site .
rep,so because you can see there's like a massive range of brands and products right so it's a little bit different than say buying a pair of blue jeans right i mean there really isn't that big of a range of blue teens they're all kind of the same thing basically right so it's just a matter of what your favourite brand is and you know you've decided because of how they did idea or something like that but i think like something so the model of skinny vs.
rep,loose fit or whatever those looks those exist everywhere right so whereas you know i think in some ways maybe it's more like a you know like this parts warehouses maybe more like you know shopify tool anyway .
rep,correct so you know i was just thinking of us you were mentioning different brands here so here's an example in parts warehouse for instance let's say you know i type in bissell which is one of the brands so yeah one you have yes the way they we've built he ought to suggest functionality for them is one we've listed out the pots for bissell and here are the models that the most popular models for michelle so similar when you're talking about you know fabulous young calm let's say if i was looking for a particular brand something that we could you know i'm just making a suggestion it just you know it could very well be customized to what you think is most beneficial to you but you know let's say somebody looking for a specific brand could type in the brand see see the different colours available the most popular colours and also some of the other popular brands and however he wants to design it that way so that way it's more visual and guided and ultimately you know it's able to you know keep the customer engaged and just from the auto suggest perspective.
rep,the other part of it is relevancy itself so you know most search vendors that you're speaking with today in this is something that you might want to you know consider asking them as well is in terms of you know how do how do they fix relevancy and you know it's mostly gonna be a text pattern match to basically you let's say if i type and blue jeans on on express comm there's a chance that you know they're looking for something that's blue and jeans are they looking for something that's blue or jeans and in the course of this process what typically happens is there's a whole lot of times where you know you would find blue shirts and blue.
rep,different items not necessarily jeans now unbxd we're slightly different where we we tokenize using our algorithms were able to tokenize each search query so first you know we you know one thing that we're able to do is to identify the correct product to we are able to map it to the correct product and make sure you know anything other than jeans is excluded from the search results and two we are also able to identify it based on the attributes so let's say somebody were to search for a brown leather belt you know we are technology understands that belt is the specific product you looking for brown is the colour attribute and leather is the material the fabric attribute and and that way show and showing a lot more relevant results.
rep,so that's from a relevancy standpoint so let me ask you this you know when you i know it's a very not very minimal number today and in terms of your search percentage but do you notice that there are people that come in and misspell queries on the site let's say they're looking for a specific brand and they misspell that term that have that been an instance we've come across any such thing.
prospect,i haven't really researched that but i'm sure that that does happen.
rep,okay yeah because you know for instance like express after he became a customer we did an audit for them and and you know we figured out that a simple word like jumpsuit could be misspelled about 216 times people would come in and type in jumpsuit and you know maybe a typo maybe a different way of maybe you synonym exactly there are 216 ways of you know finding jumpsuits and and the other so the other piece to the technology itself is we were able to essentially fix the relevancy also from spellcheck aspect to fit but you don't have to go on the back end and build out synonyms where you know it's it's pretty much taking away all of that manual labour and we were able to solve for that 90% of the time.
prospect,so that's something you have built in as an automatic sort of code thing or that's that base we have to be developed by entry and all the possibilities.
rep,no so you don't have to enter the possibility so it's out-of-the-box meaning you know so let's say you know for instance your site somebody looking for a specific colour let's say sky-blue colour now that's you know sky-blue or let's say it's a fire for instance and somebody types in green for instance so there are multiple ways of saying the same colour but you know so what what we're able to do is we were able to understand the context that in on yours on your site let's say you know green would mean you know i'm forgetting words here but but you you know so let's say emerald or sapphire and let's say somebody had to type in the actual colour name we're able to identify it out of the box and ensure relevant results so that's another piece of the technology as well.
rep,and you know the other part of it is you know iii don't know if you do recommendations today or do you see you know value and recommending products so that's another piece that we help out as well.
prospect,yes i mean we we don't do that obviously automatically we do that more on an manual basis that we're building actually into the new templates it sort of cross-selling you know.
rep,okay well so we have a widget strategy we have you know pretty much all of the widgets that's available on amazon.com today for instance you know stuff like complete the look bottles about similar products except together and and you know so while your customers to shopping and looking for products on your site what we were also doing is we were able to go in and basically track the digital footprint and let's say if somebody looking for for a silk yarn and you know you're looking at a specific product we want to recommend other products which are which are also made of silk and that's kind of thing.
prospect,so so you're able you're saying this is this is something in addition separate from search right.
rep,that is correct that is correct .
prospect,yeah and so and it is something but i assume this is something would only work that we had some kind of a database driven sites all right .
rep,when you say database driven site are you referring to the analytics that you track or no no no i mean you know that it would have to be on a platform like shopify or magenta or one of those as opposed to no having it no not necessarily so what we do is from from from a data collection standpoint the first thing that we'd install on your site is our analytics is the unbxd analytics and what that helps us do is essentially collect data from your shoppers real on a real-time basis and you know that that's pretty much how the machine learning piece comes into the picture where you know one is we are using all of you know the the keywords the queries that we've been indexed that's already trained and the second part is your business is unique to you and shoppers you know buy very differently on your site so we're also tracking that behaviour and are able to you know throw back rather than result so you know in the process we're training our system to understand and your catalogue in your product feed and and essentially you know that's how our relevancies built in.
rep,so yeah so from the analytics standpoint very many data that .
prospect,is that something that takes you know maybe a month or three months or longer .
rep,so typically you know so i know there's a lot of information that i'm telling you but you know so from what we do is a poc model for all of our customers just to make sure that we want to just to make sure that we gain your confidence that our solution works so from a poc standpoint what we do is we implement a solution it takes typically about three to four weeks to implement the solution and if it's yeah three to four weeks of our time not yours i understand yeah you mentioned you tied on resources so it's it's most of the configs that built in rn where you have to do very little work and yours and post go live we have a poc for about six to eight weeks where you know and what we do is we guarantee your revenue up taking increase in conversions in in that six to eight week period so it depending on the type of business and the of queries etc the system i take maybe a week or two to pick up stuff and build on that relevancy but you know post that you're gonna see an uptick in conversions and we guarantee we contractually guarantee an increase in conversions on that piece.
rep,during the poc and if you don't see that you don't see the value are you free to walk away .
prospect,so how is it actually implemented on a site like ours when you know when you use i'm sure looked at the pages it's like hold on the pages they're just you know flats totally pages right hand coded pages so how do you implement is it through javascript .
rep,yeah exactly so we have an in page ajax model where you know it's more a front-end and not on the back end and what that would allow you to do is where you come in and read up all you know let's say i'm looking at fabulousyarn dot com right now you you render the header and the footer and you know everything in between as far as the search is concerned all the results is gonna be rendered by us so that that would be installing your javascript snippet into your code in and that way.
prospect,that would be for the search results .
rep,search results yes.
prospect,yeah so we could create a template say this is where we want the results to hit later i mean essentially it's a free compliment right now in the new design and so it appears centre column obviously or.
rep,so but from a ui standpoint yo so from your standpoint here there there wouldn't be any change to the look and feel of the side so let's say this is the new format you know that i'm looking at in terms of fabulousyarn look and feel so let's say you know this would pretty much look like so let's say audience somebody had a search for audience and you know here's here's how your results would look yeah pretty much the same format how you would render it them on a few category pages.
prospect,and then the that sort of autocomplete happens while they're typing but then if they i guess yes return then they get a page.
rep,when you say you've returned what do you refer
prospect,enter or whatever if they i mean i'm wondering how what is the difference is that the autocomplete is happening in a pop-up right .
rep,so let's say jeans here you go okay so this is a separate window that's .
prospect,that actually will
prospect,the popup yeah.
rep,correct right so and i'm sprinting.
prospect,so what we're talking about like in the case of the art yarns example you were talking about that would be something so they would first be something like this right.
rep,precisely this like a mentioned mentioned can be customised to what you you want it to be so let's say you want it to be visual and you want a sip so we give you a few templates so express.com is one of them so if you need something more simple let's say i go to ashley furniture that's one of our customers as well and i'm looking for a sofa here yeah so for ashley it's a fairly simple template they just they just wanted to have the autocomplete in place and also show some popular products without really having to go with a brand and so on.
rep,yeah this is difference that customer.
prospect,how it is how is it that you would get the results actually on the page itself how do you how would you get to that you have any examples for that.
rep,when you're saying how we arrived at these results these images that we showing you.
prospect,no no no i mean because this is this is a separate window that pops up which is cool it's like that but the thing is that we're also talking about before we were saying you know we could have a page where someone would type in you know pink yarn or whatever and they would get a page it looks like one of our pages it would just like that our yarns page except it would all be all the things.
rep,right so you know your question is so let's say if i type and pink yarn here on your search bar what did show pink yarn on on the auto suggest.
prospect,obviously after you hit enter yeah i mean i guess you showed  the auto suggest you showed it on the auto suggest but then they hit enter do they get a page i'm not sure if it make sense.
rep,yes precisely so if i let's say if i was looking for pink yarn and i hit enter so it would take me to yarns that are pink in colour and that would be the result that would be rendered here in the middle.
rep,yeah okay
rep,does that answer your question or it deference
rep,sorry
prospect,yeah yeah. well i was wondering it do you have any i mean are there any sites that you have you're working right now that do that is express do that
rep,sure oh so from a search standpoint yeah sorry i missed out on showing you somebody so that's a if i'm looking for blue jeans here i hit enter so the resultant that would show up would be in blue jeans right so let's say i type in gray jeans for instance and you get.
prospect,yep okay.
rep,essentially and and the other thing is also from you know search box here by the error tolerance please so let's say if i were to misspell black leather jacket let's see if it takes me there so misspell all the three words almost yes okay well some of it is but yeah not all of it so let's.
prospect,leave me not have very many black leather jackets either soon.
rep,all right right so be showing me one of the results was like leather jacket and someone yeah and similarly so let's say just to also hh craig that's not the customer so even from a natural language standpoint so let's say type for hi-def tv so this is essentially a word that's not really on the catalogue and it still manages to show me relevant results for high-definition tvs .
prospect,yeah and yeah.
rep,that's essentially from the algorithm that we built for understanding natural language and and yeah so you know that's the auto suggest you know we covered the relevancy part of it you know the error tolerance similarly with synonyms you know that that's not something that you have to build in manually you know that's a yeah let's say let me go back to your sides here for a second i'm just trying to see okay so here's an example you have a category where it says beaded silk light yarn so somebody were to misspell beaded for instance you know unbxd would still show the relevant results and similarly let's say now now the colors might be very specific to your site like monitor with gold if somebody had to like google monitored gold you know there's no way that our system would have encountered that but the interesting piece that you know the technology does on the background is you know once we've implemented our solution in the one to two weeks you know our system understands that somebody's searching for monitored with gold is looking for this specific colour and it's able to show show relevant results as well.
prospect,oh yeah that would be challenging i think would be interesting to see what it actually came up with it probably would come up with other things you know with gold or something like that i don't know that's not that's that's a lot to have from a search engine.
rep,well you know so again so that's that's the only reason why we offer the poc piece where we want you to test it out and make sure you're comfortable with you know what you're getting into and like i said so something that we do is also the fact that we guarantee an uptick in conversions within that you know 60 to 90 days of the poc itself.
prospect,mm-hm.
rep,and you see the value and then then you move forward with making.
prospect,right yeah i mean if i mean obviously with planning for itself then you know that's okay .
rep,precisely yeah so what would you suggest us a good next step john you know so looks like you know there is opportunity you're evaluating search vendors so what is what are the criteria that you're looking to address when you're looking at a search vendor let me ask you that that's first.
prospect,well i mean right now probably the two big ones are ease of implementation and cost so i mean as i said we're we weren't necessarily looking i mean i can see that your product is a good one in that it performs well i think that's one that we i can't remember exactly i've looked at a bunch of these now so it's kind of a blurry you know but i do remember looking at yours and thinking this you know this looks really good even though i had never heard of it before so that's why i contacted you so but the thing is is that at the same time you know we're also saying we're just we're not big enough to be able to pay a lot of money for search and we're also or to pay a lot of money for implementation you know we have a very small staff but we do everything ourselves so we you know we don't have a big crew of tech people and you know so further we don't really have a budget to hire consultants to implement so so that's those are our two big criteria you know i mean and i think obviously we wanted to work well but we're not we're not expecting you know for that kind of a for the limitations we have to have something that's you know the greatest search in the world. we need something totally that you're basically does you know i mean i think that you know it's a we've been using google site search in it you know it's okay it's not great but it's okay you know and but it's also just pause very much so it is sudden demand much of us you know if we had a better one and it gave us better sales and yeah we would like that you know and if it was you know possible to do that within a you know budget that we could you know afford initially and then you know if it what you know as the process grew and as i mean we're we're also as you know as i said we're in the process of changing over the whole design all the templates to <> it all everything has to kind of be working with that process as well so there's a lot going on all at once here which which i guess probably complicates matters time.
rep,sure no and what what is the timeline look like when you want to launch the new site with the new design.
prospect,what's its i mean when is it gonna be complete that's a good question we don't i don't have a definite answer there and it's in five risk now so i mean we could.
prospect,probably accelerate that i mean i i think that's having the two interfaces i suppose probably really complicate things and i think that see the new design obviously is going to be a lot easier for you to work with them the old one which is a complete mess but.
prospect,and there are you know there are there are a lot of pages there are but you know it's i i don't really i can't really answer the time frame i think that you know it's whether we could complete it all by june 1st i i don't know that seems.
rep,ok ok well either way so you know the first you know point that you mentioned in terms of ease of implementation for unbxd as a solution you know like i said said oh so the front end and page ajax model is what we use for most of our customers at least during the poc so that ways you don't have to make any hard hard code changes in the back end and you know that's fairly simple where we you know where we spend most of the time building the context for you making sure everything is working and we just need a few hours from your development team just just from a testing standpoint and to go over and you know how you want to customise the auto suggest and then that kind of thing .
rep,that's that's the first piece the second piece i know you mentioned you know price it's currently you know the question is whether you gonna see value from it or not now you know did it just to you know kind of give you a ballpark i mean so so we typically started customers at $1000 per month and you know so that's that's the cost of our solution but if there is any window to make me bring it down by you know a couple of hundred dollars or so you know i'm going to work with my team internally to see if that's possible and and and and try to set you up and at the same time i mean like i said the poc is this is in place for you to see the value and and maybe you know after the poc you decide that it's not really helping the cause and you don't see the value is free to walk away but but .
rep,but like like i mentioned if you're able to see the increase in conversions well that would be your the reason field like like you said as long as.
prospect,yeah well i like my sense right now is just given what our actual sales are that i think that that seems like that would be way too much way too expensive for us at this point i mean i think it would be very challenging for even during the poc serious let's say that that was the we're gonna be proving that value particularly i have been part of the problem is that is the current state of the site you know kind of not really complete so i could see i mean like i said i mean i i think the product looks good it looks like you guys do a great job and i can see that you know makes a lot of sense i just don't think i think that it's not something that we can afford at this stage may be something we could you know look at further on down the line we evolved farther something.
rep,that makes sense john thanks a lot for that feedback yes so you know at any point in time and well if you want to reconsider you know talking to us i mean maybe do a more detailed presentation especially around the technology itself you know we were happy to you know i'm happy to get a technical resources from my side as well just make sure he walks you through all of the technology pieces and their ways you're comfortable with it as well but but you know i know where you are with things and hopefully once you have the redesign out well you know hopefully you have a lot more visitors and and a lot more people searching and then perhaps maybe maybe we can get talking .
prospect,yep all right thanks thanks very much for your time though.
rep,great thanks a lot to get time as well john you have a good one.
prospect,ok
rep,take care. bye.
prospect,and the product offer i was waiting for the phone to ring.
rep,great thank you thanks for giving us the time to show the solution today.
rep,so bob i have made a presentation and i'll walk you through that which will include the unbxd solution presentation but before i start let me introduce myself my name is ashish i work all of the sunnyvale office at unbxd and primarily work on the sales side for the smb customers.
rep,also work with amir and then help some of the new merchant customers try the unbxd site search solution.
rep,and and before i start talking about unbxd i wanted to quickly ask you a little about ihobb dot com why ihobb dot com why people buy from you and if there is anything in specific that you're looking to solve with site search today so that i can cover that during my presentation.
prospect,well i we're retail sell of collecting supplies spam coin postcard currency collectors and we also sell postage stamps for collectors.
rep,so how many products do you have today.
prospect,how many how many who.
rep,how many products do you have.
prospect,okay you only don't know the answer to that but maybe thirty five thousand.
rep,35 thousand okay that's.
prospect,see i sell individual postage stamps that can be 25 cents a piece and i sell albums that can be fifteen hundred dollars it's kind of everything in between.
rep,got that yeah i i did some some research on the site and and i could see that variation in terms of the price range for these products and some of the products are really niche and unique.
rep,so that that's really nice about your business no second thought so you're something that you're doing is really great for the collectors especially for i have friends who collect stamps and coins and at the moment i saw ihobb dot come i actually sent the link to one of my friend who collects a lot of coins so really nice.
rep,so bob also also kind of curious what do you use for site search today i know you have your site on miva merchant so for site search do you use something today or is that all in-house or default miva merchant.
prospect,i didn't understand that i'm sorry.
rep,do you use a third-party solution for site search for the on-site search or is that.
prospect,no i strictly use whatever came with miva merchant.
prospect,he's correct hey this is amir jumping in he's correct currently using just the basic search packed in with miva.
rep,cool sounds good great so let me quickly get started just wanted to make sure bob you can see my screen do you see the screen.
rep,great so here's the agenda for the call today it might look long but on high level i want to cover four things one i want to talk a little about who we are two give you the highlights on the elements of search that we resolved today three walk you through the current state of the union that we see it from our perspective on higher ihobb dot com and how we believe we can make a difference and lastly we can discuss any other details like pricing implementation process or any other questions you have does that work for you.
rep,okay awesome so to quickly start with about unbxd we are a five and a half year old company with offices in sunnyvale chicago and india our core engineering team works out of here so we have best in minds work silicon valley for us.
rep,we actually have people work from twitter microsoft yahoo search working for us we have a customer success and sales team out of chicago we do have a back-end team in india and some of the engineering work also happens there because we have a large presence in apac.
rep,we are one of the largest search providers in apac at about 80 employees everybody is an engineer and we love to build and break things we have 1200 customers globally 350 plus customers right here in the us.
rep,and and the reason we have grown faster than anybody else in this space is because of four unique differentiators one we have actually solved some of the sites search problems that were not solved before and i'll show you what those are two we create custom solutions for all our retailers regardless of what size you are.
rep,site search being so intrinsic something that works for your site might not work for target and something that works for target might not work for macy's and and that's where we try and bring that unique differentiator about your business to the site search the solution that we provide three we have tremendous capability in terms of scale.
rep,we can easily scale up or scale out depending on what your needs are without you having to do anything and lastly we are affordable and competitive in our price point and because of these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we would be the king of product discovery.
rep,here are some of our customers from an enterprise space newegg dot com ashley home store the largest furniture store in the us ib supply express has over 60000 products four hundred plus stores in the us. some of the niche speciality sites or our brands like deborah lippmann deborah herself sits with celebrities and then and makes these nail colors and lip colors and sells them online vac parts sales vacuum cleaner and other home appliance parts online puravida bracelets.
rep,from a platform perspective we work with all kind of platforms our solution it is primarily platform agnostic be it on miva magento shopify or even a homegrown e-commerce platform we can seamlessly integrate with them any any questions so far.
rep,here some of our customers yes so in in last i would say one one and a half years of our run we have seen some really good traction in the enterprise space but then we still continue to work on with all sizes of companies and then find find ourselves a fit for companies ranging from startups to enterprises.
rep,here are some of our customers who are in integration they're not yet live hh gregg us auto parts hp fresh direct lowe's cvs they are all going live by the holiday season this year.
rep,so before i get started what i wanted to do was a quick site review and get a sense on how search works on your site today and then this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end but for just us to get a background on what works on your site and where unbxd can come in and make a difference so hope that works with you.
rep,so bob the the first thing that i looked on your website was auto-suggest now the first interaction a customer has with the site search is autocomplete or type-ahead now the when i when i try to type something or start searching on your site it does not guide me anywhere right.
rep,it doesn't take me to the various categories or various popular products or search terms for something that that i'm i i start typing and and it's very important to start guiding the customer and take them to the right product quickly from the very first few characters that they start typing in on the your search bar and i'll show you how we solve this differently for each of our customers and i'll show you some of the live examples for this.
rep,then i look for spell check or error tolerance on your site try and try to make a few spelling mistakes just like any other customer right trying to type in or say especially when they are coming from mobile or a tablet they end up making mistakes and they expect your site to react just like google would.
rep,google goes and auto corrects any spelling mistake that i would do there and they expect the e-commerce sites also to do the same now when i look for say schaubak with an a it actually gave me a zero result then i look for lincoln album with l missing in there and i got a zero result page and i'll show you how we handle this differently.
rep,then i look for some of the search relevance on the site try to search a few products and then then see how the the site search was showing the results so i look for us 26 stamps here are the products but then i see you have a page for us stamps issues of 2016 which are surely totally different than what i get on search.
rep,then i look for postcard covers here postcard covers that you are carry but on search the results that i get are totally different then i look for us year sets again something that you have again i try to tweak my search query try to look for us year stamp sets being very precise in terms of what i was looking for but still i got just one product not sure if this is very relevant but here are the relevant results that i get when i navigate through your site.
rep,so surely not relevant results when i try and search some of these terms i look for us used stamps again the result sets are totally different look for coin folders this time i did get coin folders but these are only there are only six coin folders that i get through search but when i try and navigate through the categories there are surely many more coin folders that you have in the catalog.
rep,then i look for stemmed words to say postcard case versus postcard cases a plural and you'll see that the the result sets are totally different then i look for coin versus coins again totally different sets the search result sets though my intent doesn't change whether i'm looking for coin or coins i'm primarily looking for the similar products but then the results are different.
rep,then i look for search page results versus the category page results and i hope you will agree that our that on any site actually the category pages have the best results for a particular category of particular kind of products.
rep,and it's important whenever someone is looking for products which are in on a category page to redirect them or take them directly to that particular <> i see you have a category page dansco currency album now when i search for dansco currency album i actually get just one product.
rep,then i look for coin tube storage boxes or another category that you have on your site but when i search the search results are totally different of the navigation so here were just a few examples that that that i found on the on the website and then.
prospect,can you hold just for a second.
prospect,sorry about that had somebody that's going.
rep,that's okay so here was just a few examples do you see these as as areas of all our opportunities that we can work on and we can maybe improve the overall site search experience on the site.
rep,okay great so let me now show you unbxd right what we are how what is it that we do differently so on high level three things technology business and framework from a technology perspective we have solved a lot of site search problems and we'll show you what those are to create a foundation of scale.
rep,business we understand your business and why customers buy from you so that we design a solution that will reflect that differentiator.
rep,lastly framework you might be aware of say some of these opportunities or problems that you need to overcome today but you might encounter a new problem a year from now and in that particular instance how do you go about solving that problem.
rep,let's say for example you start a new category so how do you design or tune your site search to be most optimal from day one and this is automatically taken care by unbxd so rather than showing you more screenshots let me actually show you some of our live customer examples and then give you a perspective in term of sorry in terms of business how we customize some of the pieces of the of the solution.
rep,so do you see my screen parts warehouse.
prospect,parts warehouse okay.
rep,do you see that okay.
prospect,so it's just their search page is that with that but i'm looking at.
rep,this is their home page now parts warehouse actually sells vacuum cleaner parts and other appliance parts now before before they came to unbxd they used to have two different search boxes on their homepage because they have two different kind of visitors on their site. one who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the model number of the appliance they have and and not the partner right we came in we said obviously you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing this you are now putting the onus on the customer to choose the right search box. what if they choose the wrong search box also at the back end you are now doubling the problem of optimizing two different search boxes so instead what we design for them is something like this. the moment i start typing in bissell on the left hand side you will see all the parts for bissell on the right hand side you will see all the all the models for bissell and some of the top searches for bissell. here is another customer of ours us patriot tactical thirty five million dollar company they sell military apparels to us citizens and based out of texas and let me show you what what we built for them. so say the moment i start typing in ni right it starts guiding me to nike one of the most popular brand on their site something that matches with my search query and some of the popular categories within nike start showing me some some of the popular products for nike some of the top queries for nike.
rep,and also starts opening up some of the other brands that i would have probably not looked at nite ize or nite glow gear and and then starts guiding me within those categories or the categories for those brands as well. let me show you what we did for express so here's express now this is how they wanted it the moment i say started typing in jeans shows me jeans and then the various different categories within jeans now every time i scroll the particular category it changes the images within the the auto-suggest itself and shows me some other popular products for each of these categories.
rep,and lastly let me show you one more example big basket dot com i know this is not from your vertical but i wanted to show you the level of customization and the breadth of our solution in terms of how we can solve challenges for a particular customer.
rep,big basket dot com second largest grocery store in apac they were in news earlier this year for the 200 million dollar funding so if we look back at our grocery run bob you'll you'll realize that we we end up buying similar kind of products and every grocery run could be 10 15 20 products that we end up buying. and then we buy the same milk bread egg they had same kind of customers on their site buying ten fifteen products in each transaction and it used to take 60 to 70 clicks for them to even buy 15 products to search the product go to the product page add to cart and then checkout. so instead what we built for them is something like this the moment i start typing in chicken start showing me all the options for chicken giving me the ability to increase the quantity and add to cart right here from the search box. shows me a banner for any promotions that they might be running for chicken some of the commonly searched terms some of the categories for chicken not just that we took it to the next level by by adding personalization to its meaning if i was buying masala chicken more often i would see masala chicken on top but if you were buying say chicken with skin more often on the site you would see chicken with skin on top.
rep,any any questions so far.
prospect,no i think i'm following you.
rep,okay so this was the business piece now let me quickly jump on to the technology behind unbxd and and some of the the features associated with it.
rep,so before before i get into it right let me give you a quick overview so before unbxd started around five five and a half years ago both the founders at unbxd spent quite some time close to one year doing research on two things.
rep,one they crawled through various different e-commerce catalogs available online looked at how these e-commerce catalogs were designed and two they did a lot of research in terms of how people are searching today online which could be on google or on ecommerce sites and then classified the search queries into twelve different types of queries.
rep,so say exact search when i know the exact name exact model numbers sku number of the product that i'm looking for or say a feature search meaning say red dress wherein red is the feature of the product dress thematic search party dress where party is a theme for the product dress or linguistic shortcut if i'm looking for a 36 inch tv and instead of i n c h i type in the double quotes out there.
rep,so we built a relevancy in engine that was able to understand all these 12 different types of queries and that people would search on an e-commerce site on top of this relevancy engine then we built an automated error tolerance system or a multi-word spellcheck.
rep,so 85 to 90% of the words misspelled on your site get automatically corrected to show the right set of results you don't have to create any synonyms at the back end for any spell checks.
rep,now the other 10 to 15% which cannot be auto corrected are the words which are so butchered that it's real difficult for an automated system to understand it.
rep,and from from a algorithm strength perspective the the solution has the ability to auto-correct six words in a single search query with two alphabets misspelled in each word also immediately starts showing results not waiting for a customer to click on something.
rep,so you'll notice black leather jacket all three are misspelled we have started showing the results and also at the same time confirming the customer.
prospect,okay this this happens automatically isn't that i need to anticipate and put in to tell it.
rep,absolutely it happens automatically yes then on top of it what we built was the automated stemming meaning say dress dresses singular plural man men knife knives or say any of the stemmed words like game gaming center central all these are taken care of out of the box.
rep,again you do not have to create any synonyms and and and you will get the most accurate results regardless of what keywords the customers use.
rep,then on top of this we still provide you the ability to create synonyms now this is primarily for any specific i would say industry jargons so to give you an example for one of our customer who sells to weightlifting world.
rep,in weightlifting world shoes are called lifters there is no way we would know that shoes are called lifters for a particular industry also it would not make sense for us to add that into our universal corpus because lifters might mean something else in a different industry right.
rep,so we give you the ability to create synonyms for such industry jargons through our back-end dashboard and i'll show you how you can do that very easily without the help of any i would say it personnel.
rep,you can you can have your marketing team or a merchandising team create this synonymous real quick which could be bi-directional unidirectional or replacements synonymous.
rep,automated redirect now when a customer searches something which is there in your category obviously the best place to take them is to that category or subcategory page now if there are any queries that that you would want to create a redirect we do give you the ability to do that from our back-end system but the obvious ones are automatically taken care of.
rep,in all other solution you need to create a redirect true but at unbxd you don't have to do that so sneakers sneakers automatically taken care of even for singular sneaker it automatically redirects.
rep,but if you want to say redirects sandals to sneakers that is something you can do from our back-end dashboard.
rep,head query search so say on an on an electronic site i'm looking for mobile or even on your site if i come and type in say coin now you have various different categories within coin and then the intent of the customer is still not clear.
rep,we have the technology to find the right categories subcategories and start showing them in the order of importance so here you'll notice mobile mobile headphones mobile cases.
rep,now over a period of time if say people were clicking more on mobile cases then headphones then mobile cases would come to position two and headphones would go to position three and while while doing this we still don't wait for the customer to click on one of this categories but we start showing the results for the most obvious category that being mobile here.
rep,any any questions.
rep,so far do you like it not like it just curious.
prospect,i think i like it i guess we're drawing a distinction between customers who knows exactly what they're looking for and customers who don't and when i look at something that's complicated i guess that's the warning that comes up to me is how much labor on my end is required in order to make it work.
rep,sure i'll walk you through that and at this stage i'll tell you it's very minimal and then i'll walk you through that with regards to implementation how much effort is required that you are in and post-implementation what is it that that you are required to do and what kind of i would say expertise would be required.
rep,because we have built the system to be really simple for the retailer's for the merchandisers to be able to use it and and you'll see that during my later half of the presentations so i'll cover that.
rep,let me show you this video actually just give me a moment something that we built for outnet as a demo you see my screen outnet.
rep,now outnet they sell designer apparel i would say now when i look for alexander wang who's a designer and then makes a lot of different products totes shoulder bag dresses you'll see all of these products neatly bucketed into each category giving us the ability to kind of browse through these products horizontally or vertically and then and very neatly arranged.
rep,here's another big differentiator that we bring onto the table dynamic filters.
rep,so i notice you don't have filters on your website today is that because of the nature of the products that you that you sell or is that something that that you would want to but you have not done because of the kind of effort that it takes to build these features.
prospect,sizes.
rep,could be any kind of filters which could be pricing which could be say if year off of publishing could be important am just you know kind of.
prospect,the only variables i have are colour.
rep,are colour okay.
rep,so you you still don't have those as as filter is that.
prospect,no i do i do.
rep,oh okay it may be.
prospect,but but i nothing i have deals with size or any of those kinds of issues.
rep,how about the how about the price do you think that would be a good filter to have as well.
prospect,where they're looking for a price category.
rep,meaning wherein they're able to say filter the results based on the price range say if i have a budget i come on the site and i'm looking for products within say 100 to 200 dollars range right.
rep,for me to be able to view products within that particular price range within a particular category or within particular search results.
prospect,yeah not on a lot of not very often you're right you know if you think a united states postal album for example i might have one for 100 i have one for 400 i have one for 1500 but there's not a lot in between.
rep,okay i get that but let's say if you if you plan to have filters on the on the site we provide dynamic filters meaning now in this case say if i was looking for men's casual shoes irrespective of however i search for shoes.
rep,could be men's casual shoes shoes formal shoes sometimes i might not even use the word shoes it could be men's nike or men's adidas as far as 75% or more results are from a particular category that being shoes the shoes filters automatically kick-in also over a period of time the system understands which filter is more important.
rep,so say if people were using the casual shoe type filter more often then this would go on top and then and the size filter would come down in the order of importance.
rep,same thing for shirts now say if i was looking for shirts men schedule shirts shirts formal shirts the shirts filters would kick-in something which is very relevant to shirts unlike shoes.
prospect,yeah i just i'm not dealing with that those kind of variables it's really just for colour but what colour album binder do you want you know red blue green black or red you know.
rep,okay and yeah so the color is is that very limited are there more variances is it very basic four or five colours or there are more variances to it.
prospect,that's really the only variable i have on any of my products that i can think of is i don't have quantity differences certainly not size differences.
rep,and are these all paint products you know kind of indexed as individual products or you put them as variances.
rep,no are these variants do you sell them as individual products or say you have them as parent and then you have children basically.
prospect,yeah they're they're specific to products because even for example a lighthouse stock book i have one that's available in red and blue.
prospect,then the next one next to it is red blue black green and tan so four or five or two or three or <>.
rep,so here here if you see my screen the appropriate variants here we solve one of the challenge with people selling variances is on their site right.
rep,so in this example if you notice when i search for a red dress all these dresses are available in red but the images which are being shown are all in black blue gray right and and waiting for the customer to click on the red spot to look at the red dress image.
rep,giving the first experience or the feeling that this dress might not be available in red at unbxd we have the technology to find the appropriate variance image given you have the variance image indexed in your product catalogue feed they can immediately go and find it and then start showing the variance images depending on the search results.
rep,so if someone is looking for red dress we immediately start showing all the red dress images for this particular search query.
rep,okay and then we take it to the next level with colour synonyms again something which is very popular in the apparel industry say i came onto your website and look for something in crimson now if you have a crimson colour product you obviously show that.
rep,but if you don't have a crimson colour product we understand that crimson belongs to the red colour family ruby red cherry rose garnet would be much more closer colours to crimson and start showing the other red colour products instead of showing the blue or the brown or the black.
rep,zero results page all websites are going to have zero results page and the reason being you might not be carrying a product you might not be carrying a brand or say the search query is so butchered that it's really difficult for the automated system to understand the intent of the customer.
rep,and we believe the onus is on us to start guiding the customer whenever they encounter a zero result page and we do this in two ways in real-time highly personalised for each user by putting in these two different widgets.
rep,by having recently viewed products we give them the ability to go back in their product discovery journey and and and maybe go back and start looking at some of the products that they already viewed on your website now based on their affinity towards a particular brand towards a particular category a price range so various different to our catalogue attributes we start recommending some of the products in real time which they would be more probable to buy.
rep,similar products now there could be a hundred reasons why i like the shoes it could be the colour the brand the design the the price point we give customers the ability to quickly evaluate similar products by clicking on a link here see similar plot products which opens up a modal window.
rep,with other similar products available for review customer like say they can click on it they don't like this they can close the modal window and go back to the search results page.
rep,okay same thing for mobile so do you have a mobile site today is that adaptive responsive.
prospect,hey this is amir jumping in yeah he does have a second mobile site but it's not a responsive site but it does if you go to if you go to the site on on a phone it will call up a second mobisite.
rep,the m-doc site of it.
prospect,yeah essentially.
rep,okay cool not an issue so these these features are sometimes can also be built onto an adaptive site that's not at all a challenge here is an example say quick alternatives on mobile for more like this.
rep,now say for this particular sunglasses if we provide a button more like this for customer to quickly evaluate some of the similar products on a smaller mobile screen here is a mobile auto-suggest with scope suggestions and recent searches which are highly personalized for each user on mobile.
rep,then again category refinement on mobile say issues within shoes men women boys something that helps you limit the number of products that you would want to see based on your priorities on on a smaller screen of mobile and then filters i know you don't have filters but then again something that's available out of the box at any given point in time if you have filters on your site we provide the ability to have multi select filters with an apply button on mobile as well.
rep,so bob primarily what i've shown you so far are three out of the five things i wanted to talk about one the business piece the auto-suggest customized piece for each of our customers two the technology the relevancy stemming synonyms and spellcheck the colour synonyms and variances three filters and dynamicness of these filters on mobile and desktop.
rep,now i would want to quickly walk you through two more things one is the back end merchandising dashboard and two reporting and before i do that just wanted to take a pause and see if there are any questions so far.
prospect,no i think i'm following you i'm i'm just done trying to see how that fits to what you know what you're doing fits so complex to what i'm doing then it probably does with my search customers are looking at it differently than what say you're buying a pair of shoes now they already know that they need viking shoes because that's the kind of shoes that they currently have and a lot of it's a matter of it isn't getting so much directed from all the multitude of options as it is getting directed based on what they know they need to have so if you have a if you have a scott album um you know that already well you don't need to look at all of the multitude of others you just need to find the scott one and that's my challenge is get them to the scott one before they give up that make sense.
rep,yes it does so these now in that case the relevancy becomes very important now even within scott a if you have 10 different scott albums right and if i was looking for a particular scott album how you you can quickly take them to that particular album right.
rep,based on what they are searching for what is more popular on your site or say based on their history in terms of what they've bought in the past and something that might complement with that right so all these parameters are taken into picture and and then we start showing some of these search results.
rep,and then and that's how we so the idea is to take the customer to the right product as quickly as possible and then and relevancy being the topmost thing based on what they search and then how we find that product real quick.
prospect,got you.
rep,cool so let me also show you some of the the merchandising features here bob.
rep,now the the the solution that i showed you will take the product discovery on the site such experience to 90% on your on your site now the other 10% experience is something that we want you to give control of because you know your products better you know your customers better what sells better right.
rep,so there are things that you might want to overwrite in terms of what unbxd is showing and that is something that you can come and control through our merchandising dashboard.
rep,so here is the is a merchandising dashboard you have say the implementation done you will have the complete details in terms of the number of products the feed size and then and the other details.
rep,you can also manage multiple sites here which could be testing staging or multiple domains that that you might have from a single dashboard login.
rep,here are your product catalogue fields we make them searchable non searchable we tune the for relevancy but you will have complete control over to this.
rep,since i know something that you might not be doing but still if you want to have a filter you can quickly create filters you can click here facets say colour and then and then kind of select the appropriate product catalogue attribute and create a facet.
rep,synonyms to reiterate you don't have to create synonyms for synonymous words are misspelled words this is primarily for our industry jargons say lifters is equal to shoes which is bidirectional create synonym and done right that's how simple it is to create synonyms in the merchandising dashboard.
rep,now let me show you how you can merchandise a particular search query so here you can merchandise search queries for any global rules so basically say you don't want to show products which are out of inventory or you want to promote products for a part of a particular brand for all search queries right.
rep,so any rule that is applicable to all your search queries you can set them up here let me show you how you can merchandise a particular query.
rep,so say address click here merchandise so this dashboard was actually created for this site demo site dress now when i when i search for dress here are the dresses that i see on the dashboard sorry on the on the site and on the dashboard you will notice the same set of results in this in this same order.
rep,so it's a replica of your website giving you a perspective in terms of what your customers are seeing for dress on the site today.
rep,now these are all relevant results meaning these are all dresses these are not shoes or shirts um so that's the 90% experience that that that i was talking about but we give you the ability to overwrite this based on your business logic.
rep,meaning you can start filtering the results based on any of your product catalogue attribute could be brand could be price any any of the attributes or say run promotions slot sort.
rep,let's say boost brand contains eliza now for dress bran contains eliza all the eliza products are have moved on top even within eliza say i if i feel or say for your business this particular product is the new arrival of the latest product that you want to promote on top you can drag and drop and say pin product you can drag and drop this product here say pin product.
rep,so these are the product level placement on merchandising or you can also do slotting say five position five to six i want brand contains ralph now position five and position six you'll always have ralph lauren dresses even if this ralph lauren dress say goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next popular ralph lauren dress and all of these changes occur on the site in real time.
rep,so if i was to now look for dress you'll see the same set of results that we were seeing on dashboard you can also add banners for these search results page you can insert an image url landing page url or an html.
rep,now let me quickly show you how you can also create landing pages say if we were running a promotion this this month let me call it a clearance obviously i don't see anything on the website today for clearance because there is nothing in the catalogue for it.
rep,so you come here clearance clear create rule click on merchandise nothing because again there is nothing in the catalogue for clearance i can click on this button here convert to landing page on the right top click ok now we have the complete catalogue available for us to curate for this particular campaign or for this particular landing page say filter brand contains eliza.
rep,similarly i can now pin products you can run promotions you can boost or you can slot even for this particular landing page and add banners and now when i go to the website again look for clearance here are the results for clearance.
rep,you can now take this url and start using it for any of your seo campaigns email marketing campaigns or any other marketing campaigns first for this particular landing page clearance this month or or any other similar promotions.
rep,and lastly let me also show you so i know again let me just show you this so within for categories you can also merchandise the category pages here so say men as category you can come here click merchandise add images for this particular cat category pages and also modify filters or facets from here say i want price filter on top you can drag and drop that you want the brand filter in the second position drag and drop and then you can control the filters for particular categories as well.
rep,so this is this is the merchandizing piece then comes reporting so what are used for reporting today is that google analytics or any other reporting tool that you use today.
prospect,what is that.
rep,reporting how do you what do you use for reporting.
prospect,hey this is amir just jumping in so right now his analytics tool is google analytics.
rep,okay with tools like google analytics right the challenge is say i come to your site start searching for something and and don't find it on the site then i start navigating and end up buying google analytics will still tell you that it was a search conversion because my session started with search but actually it's a navigation conversion.
rep,because search did not help me find the right product and it was navigation through which i ended up eventually bought the product right so with with unbxd we overcome such challenges with reporting we accurately report the search sessions versus the browser sessions.
rep,and we provide three levels of reporting here is the high level overview for an executive level reporting in terms of what your search sessions are what your brow sessions are some of your top search queries some of your top products added to cart top <us all> queries or say top click products that that you can look at.
rep,again this is not limited number of products number of queries you can look at the data for last say one week one month one year and and there's no limitations in terms of how many queries or products you see here.
rep,then the second level of reporting is the queries reporting here you get all the queries on search queries on your site and their performance in terms of their heads views click-through ctrs conversions and orders then for a particular query dresses say if i click on dresses gives me a trend line in terms of the performance of this particular query.
rep,how this query has been performing over a period of time so say as of today if i see the performance coming down now we know that we need to go back to the merchandising dashboard and start merchandising for this particular query to ensure that the performance goes up and here you will also notice some of the products associated with this particular query in terms of their views add to cart and then the average <program>.
rep,on the flip side we also provide product level reporting all your products and their individual performances in terms of views and add to cart then when you click on a particular product you'll again see a trend line over a period of time how the product has been performing how the part has been converting and some of the queries <>.
prospect,so it tells me how they have how many people have searched for that product is that what you mean.
rep,so this kind of gives you the trend in terms of i would say how often so let me into here you will see this particular product how many times this was viewed and then how many times this was added to cart this is where you'll get that information right and then here you will get the sales data basically.
rep,and this is a relation between the queries and the product so for what queries obviously we don't have the data for this demo site but for what queries was this product being showed up and then how many times it was viewed for each individual query added to cart and then ordered does this make sense.
rep,so that's the solution bob any any questions.
prospect,no i think i'm on board with what you're doing and what i'm seeing here are just the results the same as i getting now for for a if you do a search this isn't some newly created page it's just the result of a search inquiry.
rep,i didn't get that sorry.
rep,well and i'm trying to ascertain how much one of the ones like i'm looking at here is how much work will be involved to make this function on my end.
rep,okay so from from an work perspective right what we do is we typically take care of the complete implementation right i'm sure so the unbxd <imodium> or amir's this team i could get into the implementation and take care of the complete implementation.
rep,all we would need from you are few things like access to your newer merchant back end right that's one thing we need.
rep,we would want to implement our analytics just the amount of effort you would have put in in implementing google analytics which is putting in one line of code and run on few pages on your website to start capturing the analytics on your site that is what you would want you to take care of.
rep,then we would come up with some of these designs on your website just just like the auto-suggest designs i showed you in the beginning we would come up with some of these designs and send them to to you for approval you can review them and share your feedback suggestions corrections.
rep,we do the complete designing and implementation of it working closely with you then we take care of the complete implementation we test it at our end and then give it to you and your team for testing that's where we would need some of your involvement you and your team can then test the the implementation done by unbxd before we go live.
rep,once you are satisfied with the results if there are any bugs or any issues that you see you can get back to us we will come in and solve those for you and then once you are completely satisfied we take the site live.
rep,so you will see the most of the owners in terms of implementation is on unbxd with least on you and your team.
prospect,and then bob this is amir jumping in and then as far as the rest of it frankly we can help you do the rest there isn't there isn't much on your end that you're gonna really have to touch other than kind of deciding on what you want to spend and then approving designs and you know just using it to make sure you're good to go with it but other than that between us and the unbxd team we do everything.
prospect,okay alright and now you had mentioned results how do we track results you know what what impact is this is supposed to have on my on my sales.
rep,so bob before we go in live right if we look at your site statistics and we look at your current conversion rates and over a period of 30 60 90 days we can we can be we can look at your increase in the conversions typically what we have seen is an increase of anywhere around ten to fifteen percent increase in research conversions in the first 90 days of unbxd going live.
rep,and anywhere between 20 to 30 percent increase from from six months to nine months of going live.
prospect,okay i've just had some folks walk in and i need to cut this short.
prospect,okay so guys this is amir just want to jump in real quick to make sure we can coordinate real quick bob no problem at all what i can do is get with ashish and get you a ballpark price and then i can kind of email back and forth and see if this is something you want to do.
prospect,ashish if that sounds okay with you me and you can take this off presentation and discuss prices etc and go from there.
prospect,because i mean i like what i'm hearing and question is just a matter of the budget and results so.
prospect,okay so why not i'll talk with ashish bob and we'll come up with something to email you and then we'll just take it from there does that sound reasonable.
prospect,okay thanks bob for your time.
prospect,alright well thank you appreciate it.
rep,thank you bob.
prospect,yeah take care.
rep,have a good day.
prospect,hey ashish sorry about that bud.
rep,no that's okay i understand.
prospect,that was an excellent presentation by the way you did a great job.
prospect,yeah definitely why don't we shoot him over i let me tell you just so i can kind of put you in the perspective of what this clients all about.
prospect,bob is looking for new technologies and consulting to help him kind of boost his business into the next stratosphere but he's very results-oriented.
prospect,can we come up with some kind of pricing where we say hey bob give us 90 days at this rate if we can prove to you in those 90 days you know that we work then we can pay this much can we do something like this ashish.
rep,can we get some stats on their site so i know we do that right the roi based pricing we have been doing that for some of our customers in the past and even now we do that but that's typically for larger customers.
rep,but in this case i can maybe talk to monal but i am sure he is going to ask me the stats so if we can get some stats in terms of and i can share share that in excel with you in terms of what data we need.
rep,primarily what their monthly visits are average order value there's conversion site search conversions or their overall conversion if we can get that data i can work in spend some time here internally with monal and the team to see if we can propose an roi based pricing for them.
rep,so awesome so what on average what's this traffic like on a monthly basis.
prospect,you know i think he gets about on monthly on unique impressions is about 15 to 20000.
rep,okay and do you have search sessions by any chance.
prospect,i have to look for that i do know that about 50% of all of these unique sessions come from come from site i don't know about the site search statistics yet.
prospect,i do think ashish i was gonna say i definitely think he's a lower price customer but i do think you can afford 12 thousand a year so.
prospect,okay cool cool thank you ashish.
rep,okay great amir thanks.
rep,these are five key elements to build up effective search solution before we get there i also want to spend a few minutes doing the quick site review of window rutherford at uk and please don't get me wrong this is not for me to come in and tell you that okay if you're not doing this well or that well this for me to just get a context and we need to understand if there's an opportunity available for me an unbxd will move on okay. and then we spend some time on recommendation we do product discovery as a whole we do site search product recommendation category navigation and merchandising so we'll quickly go through both elements as well and then i'll show you the dashboard actually know how we can make money so that's that's the quick agenda i had for today
rep,roughly should take about 45 minutes but at any point in time if you have any questions feel free to stop me and then towards the end of the call we can also discuss if you were to go ahead with unbxd what would be the cost involved and what could be the potential integration steps so.
rep,any questions
prospect,no sounds good for me.
rep,okay awesome so just to reintroduce myself so my name is sharath keshav so i had sales for unbxd with a north american region we are a five year old company we have about three offices across the world we are headquartered in sunnyvale san francisco we have an office in chicago here in the midwest and we have a team in india a team in the us especially in san francisco are core marketing engineering and product folks of our sunnyvale office our customer success team and our sales folks work out of the chicago region and we have a back-end team in india plus we have a few hearing folks we should have a fairly strong presence in asia apac as well about 1200 customers globally about 300 in the us 2015 has been a big breakthrough year for us close to 50 percent of the customers
rep,a big have a very very customizable solution because we believe every company differentiates itself on its own merit and you can't have a same template style approach for every company you work with hence the customization but despite customization it does not mean that we take six months to implement we integrate in under four weeks and you will and i'll show you why we do it and how we do that we have an extremely highly scalable infrastructure you can scale up and scale out we have a very strong infrastructure bag backbone and the entire search experience is accelerated but despite all this we are extremely cost-effective hence we believe that today and even going forward we will be the king of product discovery.
rep,this is a quick snapshot on some of the customers we work with target newegg newegg is the second largest etail store in the us ashley furniture one of the largest furniture stores in the world express bells outlet we are in the process of integrating with fitness bread and cvs pharmacy this is from an enterprise perspective we also work with a lot of ir500 and ir1000 customers and some pure-play online brands deborah lippman the fairly popular vac parts based on the midwest ended sylvain purvida name of you.
rep,and the good part is we are completely platform agnostic we work very seamlessly on platforms like magento or big commerce the shopify amoeba where we actually have a plug-in built in which makes integration a lot more seamless or we also work equally well on any custom platform that you might have homegrown so the platform is completely agnostic to know the platform that you might be on any questions on this first.
prospect,no it's fine.
rep,i believe you are in magento enterprise right. okay would you be on a custom platform or
rep,something.
prospect,yes we're on a custom built in.
rep,oh thanks for that info.
rep,so what i wanted to do is do a quick site review when we do a site to view
rep,there are a few key elements that you look at so one we look at how was it auto-completed experience i am sure you know we believe autocomplete is the most experien important experience when you get onto an e website because it has to be brazil and it has to be invited we look for that autocomplete experience and if
rep,there is any opportunity available from that perspective then we look at the relevancy aspect itself relevancy and variances in terms of how consistently your gets to a more like to make comparison okay. so this was the first thing we did so we looked at how was the autocomplete on your site we looked at sex toys we looked at underwear so what you would notice is one good thing yeah there is definitely a visual autocomplete however we did see that there was an opportunity for the autocomplete will be more guided sex dolls or the underwear but not the first search suggestions that are actually gave me even after typing of the entire word and and when you look at the product suggestions below not every suggestion is relevant especially in the
rep,underwear example it could be an indexing issue also but for me as an end user and not as somebody who knows your business on your site or more search as such for me it's a good experience to have a visual aid but it's not completely guided to my liking right just a quick feedback. the second thing that we looked was for the relevancy itself where we compared if i were to come and look for a product on your search page versus going into a category page in the same product do i get consistent results what i did was i looked for vibrators on search and also look for the vibrators on the category page right when i look at the category page i see products which are close to 32 pages i'm sure there are tons of products available when i go through search my
rep,first experience if you user i just seen three pages right that is i noticed and again chris i'm not nitpicking on this this is for just to me to get a context on where the opportunity could actually right right then i did something similar for condoms look at you economist again look at a category page found eight results then when he looked at the search itself but the first result that i got was actually not a condom so i'm not sure if it's doing more of a text pattern match where it's looking at eurex and condoms and showing either all of those products that's one observation i had. then i also the same thing with fruit flavored condoms jut looked up fruit flavored condoms in the search box the first four that i actually seen ii did not have any bump
rep,similar with the black dildo this is where i am probably a little more confident that it was probably a text pattern match where it's actually doing anding it either black or dildo i see some brown dildos as well and then do it did a quick check on error tolerance try looking for but but clubs i did not find the exact relevant results of actually looking for again as i told you this was just for me to get a context on where the opportunity lives any suggestions or questions that you have i'm sure you might already be aware of it but again if there was any inputs for me to understand and get a better context you can let me know.
prospect,no it's quite interesting so any interest in <> .
rep,okay and so now i want to show what we've done again it's no sense in this pointing out an error at not the solution to it what i'll do is i'll go through the same elements that i pointed out that we found that inconsistency in is site and i start taking you to some live examples so that you get a much clearer perspective so first the auto complete feature so i want to take you to three examples right and three in three diverse category so that you get a perspective on what is the breadth of results that we are actually talking about right so.
rep,the first example i want to show you from parts ware house manufacturer category we this is a customer this is one of our first few customer to us they've been with us for three years now and they're roughly about thirty five million dollar business based or the midwest this is
rep,how this site looked like before they came on to unbxd so one distinct thing that you would notice is that you would see two different search boxes right the first search box for them was to for a user to come in and come and look by a part and the other one was to for a user to come in and come in look by a model name this is primarily because their business use case was similar because they had they when they looked at their analytics they basically had users who would either come and look by a part number probably they know the exact part number or they have users who just came and searched by model name and also what they had as a problem with the backend is they had to date different databases where these information was stored so what they thought the best way to solve the problem is to have to do prints were succeeding when we came and we observed and we told them that the problem here is now you're putting the onus on the
rep,customer you're expecting the user to come and pick the right search box and we all know how difficult it is to optimize for a single search experience here we have to optimize for two different such experiences and the relevancy because of this having two search boxes for some major major issue so what we did we said we solve for the same business use case but you just use a single search experience so here if you start typing in the bissel what you b i s s right again solving for a specific business use case.
rep,i'll give you another example this is from the apparel world us patriot tactile roughly about fifty five million dollar business they specialize in selling military apparel to non military personnel.
rep,now and they had a very unique business use cases where so their problem was their analytics told them that a as a company they have a fairly large catalog they work with a lot of niche brands but when they look at their analytics the issue was that people will come in and look for nike look for products or nike and buy them but they also have other brands with this problem the long tail which is never exposed at all so they wanted an autocomplete experience which is a little more guided which tells their users that ok beyond nike ii there is something else also available i'm just giving you an example of a nike that and also what they wanted to do since they sell shoes which are slightly expensive primarily in the range of 150 dollars they wanted that experience to be a little more visual so that they can <>
rep,attention of the user of a specific popular product being available right so here if you go and look for  ni on the auto complete bar what you'd see is one you see all the scope suggestions it will show me nike which is probably the most popular there also show me the popular categories within nike ok police on duty black tactical and lightweight boots are probably the most popular ones now you also tell me that there's something called as nightclub gear and 9 line apparel which me as a user i would ever know it actually exists from the site  right it shows me all the popular products which was another business use case i handed they wanted a visual feel of their popular products yes we also show all the top queries starting with energy now if you actually compare the first example and the second example one thing one thing you would distinctively notice with each of our implementations that every
rep,implementation is customized to their business use case you never get the feel that ok if you go and look at 7 10 different a semi customers not to brag here but you would see a very templatized autocomplete feature but here you see customized feature we don't do customization because we like to brag about our product but it is video customization because we want to build something which suits you as a thumbs anyone ok .
rep,and the third example i want to show you is from the online glossary space right big basket is the largest online gocery in southeast asia they were in the news last week because they raise their series around of 150 million dollars right .
rep,and this specific use case was this so they had realized that from the analytics that generally the customers buy about anything 220 products is in single transaction so and when they when you have to buy 18 to 20 products you end up going 60 to 80 clicks so they wanted an an experience where people can hide products to cart in the fastest possible manner right and secondly they wanted this to be personalized with this if me and you have to do glossary every week you'll probably buy the same things we probably buy eggs milk and chicken probably every single so how can i personalize it for me is the second use case so here if you actually notice the moment i start typing c h i c a we will display products that you change quantity and add products right from the search box right so this
rep,is the fastest way to add products into the set experience right i can basically say one and it will quickly show this is added to the search box right then you also display a banner with any sale or anything that you want to display and then will also slow all the commonly  search terms for something starting with thi c so all the popular brands of chicken and all the popular categories and it is personalized in a way where if i'm a user who buys chicken without skinned chicken without skin comes up to me on top if you buy chicken with skin chicken with skin comes up to you up top.
prospect,with me on the surface.
rep,yeah you like what you see .
prospect,are you a you surgery person or is not resolved.
rep,i didn't get you.
prospect,is that some personalization in the background going on to make sure to get best results will be saying this chicken without skin and chicken with skin let's sort it by some previous purchase history.
rep,yes was we look for this side we basically said the street to six months so we basically base it on the last six months of history of what the user has come and bought on their side then we show them the right kind of products.
prospect,okay yeah no missions.
rep,great so this was about the auto complete i just start instead of showing you theory or at least show you live examples of different industry so that you get a better perspective right.
prospect,can i just interrupt one minute you even show the desktop versions but we go mobile example.
rep,yeah. yes let me see if i have a snapshot for a mobile autosuggest yeah this is one of the mobile autosuggest snapshots i have alright i can also give you a few sites you can definitely go and look at the big basket thing itself they have an app so so basically this how a mobile auto suggest would look like and this is how multi-select filtering options on a mobile device when you click and from a mobile standpoint we've we've been extra careful primarily because we have a lot of customers from asia apac region somebody like a big basket or even a flip cark what you would know this is 60 to 80 percent of that traffic is actually on mobile devices
rep,you know we've built our products primarily to work very very well on the mobile space.
prospect,okay your specific interested in my virus phone as well so we got responsive web sorry so it's not an endo is responsive.
rep,yeah i had work seamlessly you can look at many of our example i can share with you a few links is where you can go under and as i'm saying with this primary ties back into our philosophy so the way we work with customers we know that today we'll probably built a great product but being in the barrier we also know that somebody else might build a better product a year from now or two years from now so just having great technologies is not enough but it's very important when you as a partner as a technology partner to tie your customers business goals with the technology power that you bring it and that's where we are different and that's why you see the example of customizations at every stage of our solution and when we talk about frame what we primarily mean is probably today you understand all the challenges and opportunities in your business but
rep,twelve months from now if you want to open a new category that's where we can partner to you and we can come in and tell you but with our experience of working with 1200 retailers this is probably something that you all have to do from a product discovery standpoint that will help you attract better conversions from paper generally this is how the approach we take to work with our customers so now getting back to business so again just to reiterate the glossary example that we actually saw where we had suggestions based on user r ated you have the ability to modify quantity add to cart one set and these all the business use case that we solved for.
rep,similarly with the back part example deborah lippmann again they primely products in the order of probability a and never show out of stock products.
rep,so just perspective on how he's built it for that.
rep,so that's about autocomplete so second important thing is relevance when you just probably the toughest problem to solve for anybody so what we did while we were building the platform now understanding how how critical relevance issues within google in some ways is not all the relevancy issue so what we figured that any kind of query that a user will come and type on any kind of an equal side primarily falls under 12 buckets right a user will come to a site and probably not search by a part number by a model name by an exact product description write something like black leather jacket or they might come and look by a specific theme they might say party shoes or casual trousers a sports footwear i or they might actually come and search by natural language might i might come
rep,specific ecommerce site so we bucketed these twelve types of query and these started building algorithms is a foundation to a platform that can resolve at least eighty to eighty-five percent of each of these types of query because we knew that if we build algorithms at this had a foundation level it will solve a majority of such problems relevancy will by default be much better than anybody else out so that's the foundation that we have built relevancy on this so that i want to give you perspective. since we have taken this kind of an approach a lot of relevancy related issues when you talk about variances or error tolerance starts coming naturally to the system the one thing with because now the system is solving something contextually
rep,and not doing the pure text pattern match if you look at this example black leather jacket right yes we're solving for error tolerance but the way we do it is because the system at the back end understands that jacket is actually a product type leather is actually a fabric attribute and black is actually a color attribute that's the only reason why it resolves to did you mean black leather jacket and if there's more than one option that you display those options and then it'll start showing results right from the word go it will not it'll save you another click of you having to come and keep on yes i did in black leather jacket and then it takes me to the screen so the way we've build the system is it can auto correct not just a single word but up to six words in a single long search space and if we kind of stopped its it's because the performance started getting impacted beyond six and we thought if we
rep,solved for six errors in a single phrase you would have probably solved 95 to 98% of any kind of query on e-tail site right this is on error tolerance and another thing that comes foundation with the platform is the ability to manage stemmed words it could be plural like dress dresse condom condoms or it could be stemmed words like would would incent essentially it not only resolves it automatically but it will also start showing consistent research but we do understand that there are situations where you have you are in a news industry where you have some specific industry jargons like we have our customer in la they sell weightlifting gear and in their world shoes are called lifters this i can't create it a stemmed word or a synonyms word for that in my back end because in another industry lifter might mean something altogether different in such cases we let you build synonyms and not only can build bi-directional
rep,synonyms but you can also build unidirectional synonyms and replacement synonyms on the backbone and when i take you to the dashboard i'll show you how simple it is to do that right and again just to repeat myself you don't have to build manually or create synonyms for any kind of spell checks for any kind of stem words we already have a repository of close to 120 million words there is foundational to the platform which will resolve for anything which is a fairly common word i mean the etail world automatically the only time that you might have to build synonyms yes if you have to build for something which is very specific to your verticle any questions chris.
prospect,no its done .
rep,i generally have a habit of going on with it so please stop me if you are not following something.
rep,thank you and another thing that we do as foundation the platform is automated redirect so if i'm looking for something which matches your category type we directly take you to the category page because we believe that's the best place where you would have optimized for the product of the user experience and then then we also do a few things finally from a ui perspective because we believe in product discovery the user is the king and we have to make his experience as better as we can so we have done a few ui element we work that we believe actually enhances this one simple example is if i come and look for say condoms on your site or sex or sex toys on your site probably it matches with 40-50% of the categories that we have right so there will be a lot of products displayed so for such inquiry what we do is we horizontally one example that we've done is we add we've basically taken a horizontal scope where
rep,we've set up these are the different subcategories of mobile and vertically we start displaying all the products and just think and completely personalize with if i figure after 30 days in machine learning that mobile bluetooth is more popular than mobile headphones and bluetooth actually appears on a head of search result. similarly we can also do bucketed search results if you have a specific brand which sells more than one specific product then we can actually bucket them with the horizontal and vertical grader so that from a from a user it's more easy for me to browse through specific verticals that the specific brand has to offer.
rep,then another very important thing is the entire aspects of filtering in facets so we do dynamic filters and the reason we call this dynamic is if we have a specific category if you have something called men casual shoes which you which your analytics says that this is very popular and you want to define a specific set of attributes for men scheduled shoes you can define these attributes once you define them as a user i can come to your site and look for men pop new shoes and party shoes it doesn't even have to have the words in it it can be men's adidas men's nike the results with will appear with the same attribution if i change a vertical i wanted to find a specific set of attributes for men casual shirts once i define it and apply filters and save changes then i can come and look for men formal search and party shirts mens ralph lauren men tommy configure results
rep,will appear with the same attributes any questions on this.
prospect,not so hot.
rep,and we generally have a as i told you are just mostly a search accelerator that works at a back end so i just give you a quick snapshot on how fast the faceting a filters work so if you go to us patriot look at fullness and beauty right so okay they have defined several set of filters for a specific brand like this right now show you how fast the filtering options work i can look at sides of booth van 5:11 tactical colour black with regular size sorry that's regular size seven point five six inch height 75 two hundred dollars in five so i basically drill down to exactly the product i actually want in just a few seconds and this is like an ajax approach we use typically the given as a header and a footer and a empty div tag and we do html injection and generally we've seen with this approach the response time is sub 30 seconds sub
rep,20milli seconds just wanted to show you an example.
rep,so another thing that we manage is the variance aspect which might be very relevant to you so here so another thing that we manage is the variance aspect which might be very relevant to you so here are viewing an example of a color variants but have searched for address what you would notice is apart from a result on the second fold which actually shows me like this everything else is from a user perspective not relevant right from our merchants perspective i actually have a red colour available in each of these images that i was showing but i'm and ending up showing a popular image and not the red color that the user might be looking for with unbxd we solved for this automatically if you've indexed it correctly if you have a red color or the family of red colors
rep,available in there we actually show that image and not relativity and we do that because we have a colour synonym corpus builted in back end it understand which are the primary parent colours you also understand all the child colours associated with that. so we built it because you have a lot of these cosmetic brands to work with us and for them attributions like rose and arctic and sky and may be very very important so we have to resolve for these specific child colors or we don't have a rose color at least show them a cherry and red which is more relevant for me than for them show them blue and black. okay .
rep,and then another thing that we do is you cannot have an infinite cat clock there will be instances where you got users might end up in a zero results page but instead of showing them a blank page what we believe is showing something like do these two widgets which is recently viewed and seller top sellers it gives an option for a customer to go back and this actually gives an option to the customer to go forward and this is completely customizable if i'm a user who spent ten minutes on your site probably looked at 15 different products but there are three or four products where i spent most time on i did some actions on that product no it could be adding them to my wishlist i probably tried adding them to cart i look at detailing faces on that product so then the same products will actually
rep,appear here in this this specific widget is based on the implicit actions of the user in this current session right so makes it more relevant for the user to move back another any questions this.
prospect,no no its cool.
rep,so another thing that we do again from the ui perspective is there might be multiple reasons why i like the specific guide if i want to see similar products will probably help you alternate product discovery instead of taking you to a new page or a new window what it does is actually infants of a module window where i can look for products select a specific product in one with as i told all that solutions are built to be responsive on a mobile app as well this is like a system more like this often is how it works mobile phone and we believe a mobile autosuggest should be even more effective because people who have tendency to make more spelling mistakes on a mobile device because it's a smaller screen smaller keypad people have 5 stubby fingers and the categories hoping that has to be built effectively for a mobile device is much much different than a laptop
rep,because people have lesser time when they buy on a mobile device when usually in a hurry and you want to be very accurate plus we also add something like a recent searches where if i'll come and trying to buy from a mobile responsive site or my tablet of mine if i have looked at 10 different products i want to go back to third product we have to retype entire product name again i can actually go to recent searches if on the third product and just continue with my buying experience right. this is from an app standpoint this is just a ui that you built for one of our customers which is something very similar for you here primarily men wouldn't boys and girls you can build something similar for you as well this is the multi select filters again very the mobile device is very important thing you to i was seamless so that's typically what i wanted to show you in search we started
rep,with auto complete we look at a few examples live example how we are different in customize from auto complete then we look at relevancy i told you what have foundation to the platform and how we resolve for error tolerance is and in stemmed words then we look at filters and facets as an option and then we look at mobile responsiveness and how we build solutions for mobile . okay. any questions on this.
prospect,no i'm i'm so perfect so look at the
rep,business tools. great awesome so i wanted to spend a few minutes on recommendation for you so then we actually adopted of widget strategy for recommendations
prospect,actually recommendations we just we've got assistance  already we have implemented one at the moment and that would be recommendations sorry
prospect,<> sorry.
rep,want to spend some time on this recomendation or you want to just pass this for now.
prospect,it's probably this probably not it worth it cuz watching the minutes do it in a moment and that will take over all recommendation areas.
rep,so yeah just not spend more than a few minutes on this so primarily what we've done is we've basically built it by these four specific themes that there are four things are important one is the popularity thing you actually look at the user data for the last six months as to what is trending on your site what are the categories and products if enough people buying on your site and people from which location of mine what kind of products you pick this thing and build all our operated widgets and anything to do with ranking on the product right the second that we build this a theme for wisdom of love this is primarily use for our up sell and cross sell widgets what we mean by wisdom of love is a we look at your site because all the products watch and then we also look at products do thing where if five of the ten users have watch say a positive condom with a dildo right then we
rep,basically when somebody buys either a condom or a dildo we basically show a proper upsell or cross-sell options it and then content based is primarily used for showing all these similar products are more like this kind of widgets where we look at product detailing pages understand the attributes associated to product look at what are the similarities we created the catalog and personalization is completely based implicit behavior a we look at six months of user data generally shopping history we also affect primary rule sets might have defined for new users show them this for repeat users show them this because probably your analytics has told you that new users won't spend too much money but you repeat user spend like 3x of that coming from that location on your site and what the user has done in this specific session on your site so basic on all this and show him some
rep,personalization widgets just to take another minute show you some live examples of what we've done this is a real-time personalization .
prospect,copy or little mortar i said boom or too much for the personalization iv there but obviously we are not it some we have an external system of just going to do it so it would be something we look at .
rep,okay no this is i'm not comparing it with your site i'm just like you what is that we've been for some of the customers i know the system is new so i'm not doing a comparison.
prospect,okay but if you can just quick if you just quit you jump over them because i'll see it's not something we're interested in if we were to look at a conspiration on.
rep,so so no problem. another.
prospect,<> honest rama have a bit more we look at how the backend looks and things over. so that's more about have more interest at this moment on .
rep,no problem so what i want to do now is quickly show you the dashboard itself so this is just a quick overview of a dashboard you'll see the list of products your feed size your index you can send us your catalog to a csv xml or put it on the ftp location where you can automatically pull it defined time intervals once we get all your feed you basically all the feeds are displayed right here and you can basically and even in this a little things this is where all your facets and filtering options based on my catalog will actually appear you can actually edit any faster that you want to build out or if you want to add a facet you can just define a facet and select a field if you wanna map in to this is where you have your synonyms again just to repeat myself you don't have to build synonyms for spelling mistakes or
rep,stemmed words but if there is something very specific to your industry you can add acid in them define a unidirectional or bi-directional all the way place when you put into it that's why right and this is where you can manage all your different domains if you have a different sub domain or if you have a different the fewer environment apart environment you can manage everything right from here this is just more like an overview of a dashboard the second important thing is merchandising that's what all of us make money help you merchandise research we also help you merchandise your category pages under browse right if you want to say build out of queries specific to unser and just clear this off so they can rebuild this so if you want to basically merchandise a specific query so what we've done is we've built quick demo site and if we go to this demo site and say if you don't dress right
rep,have a specific set of products which actually starts appearing to me you have a catalog we've got 250 products so if i have on merchandise is query all i have to do is quickly go add a rule right once you add a rule i can quickly merchandise when we talk about merchandising you can do filtering where you can go and select a specific attribute that you want to filter or you can run promotions where you can actually sort them again by a specific attribute boostin and slot them you can also run banners and create custom landing pages you can basically define and move and drag and drop products so that you exactly show the customers what you want them to see and this thing can just be put as a banner image your facebook page campaign and also your paid campaigns on google very easy to do promotions if i want to say promote the specific query i just choose a boost level and then i basically choose an
rep,attribution i can basically say title james is a title in aisa so what you've notices immediately all the alisa products are sorted then i can basically drag drop them in a specific product the way i wanted to pin and then if i feel this is the first fold i also want a high-value product in my first fold where i get most margin i can do slotting it in generally say at position three so actually a ralph lauren product would actually gives me better margin i can say brand includes ralph and what you would notice sorry what he would know this is a ralph lauren part has sloted and present in three so now i go back to the site demo site and click on search again instantly what we do is it will show me the print product it will also show me the slotted product right so even this is applicable if you want to run say a campaign if you say you want to run a campaign for me you say made a sale or ran something for me they
rep,sale so obviously nothing is available here so all you have to do is merchandise the query the a to go click on merchandise obviously nothing will show right here convert this into a landing page once you convert this into a landing page your entire catalog is actually available then you can same back drop them pin them and then boost choose a specific element for boost and choose a specific bannering create a link will create in any html if you wanna build out and save the banner and use that link on any of your campaigns .
rep,okay so like we can do it for query you can also set all category rules we can define okay this is my specific main category on a merchandise for this category i can use a banner and then i can also define my facets and filters so for men i figure that okay price is the most important attribute right brand is the second important attribute colour is the third important attribute but i can basically define it for men and just click on save changes and go on with my so once you set it up anything to do with men the attribution will follow the same rule right this is on merchandising for search similarly you can merchandise all your category pages as well you can dress shoe you can do the same things we can do drag drop products you can pin a specific product you can run promotions where you can start say about
rep,a specific brand and you can start with the attributes here right and then also slot in a specific rule and then walk any questions so far of this.
prospect,no this one is good.
rep,and
rep,the third important element is reporting itself i do you use omniture of google analytics today.
prospect,we use google analytics.
rep,so one general thing that you heard from customers see in google analytics what could happen is i am a user i come and search for a product on your site i okay don't find it through the search results but then i end up navigating to your product pages and buying the product in that same session what google will tell me is that this specific search session triggered a conversion which is not exactly true because yes i did search in the session yes i did buy in the session but the two actions are not infinite you might end up believing that your search is actually performing better so what we do is we do reporting by your search query results by your browser actions and also all the key metrics right and we also give you reporting for
rep,query level and per product level so that you're absolutely clear as to where the saints are coming in from is it through search browser to a specific query strength or is it to a specific particular activity right so this is a high-level overview we give you all the top search queries your top products added to cart your top click products and the top 0 results and again we don't restrict it by the top 250 queries for top 500 queries even if you are 5000 queries you wanna drill under and find out which is performing well and which is not performing well we give you the ability to do that and you can drill down for every single query you can go and look at your entire query list and say okay i wanna drill down for dresses you will get all the query transfer dresses you'll get the complete query conversion funnel for dresses as to how the specific query is performing is it performing 5% ctr or
rep,the defining 2% ctr what is performing badly then you are actually good do you look at okay what are the products associated with this query and what i have to do for merchandising stand point to include the performance like we do it for query you can also do it for performance you can get a list of products you can look at product trending for a specific category in a taxonomy you all the queries associated with the product and also look at the funnel and on running through it but this wanted to give you an overall perspective.
prospect,okay correct.
rep,okay so after this i wasn't wanting to spend a quick minute talking to you on just want to make sure i've covered everything this was a demo dashboard it might not show the results so this is just a user behavior study that we're done for one same what you would start noticing is from entire product discovery experience you started noticing that these elements started showing up the uptick and hence the results so better from a support standpoint chris we don't differentiate people between priority premium and standard for us every customer is a premium support and phone support and we guarantee you five nines of availability and we penalize ourselves in case our availability is not that it just never happened in the last five years just a quick example on scale here we would notice that there's a million requests now and if you look at the
rep,latency apart from this once for instance we've been able to scale up and scale down on in a very very consistent manner in terms of pure play implementation you can take three approaches one is a standard api based approach our back-end approach generally this way it takes four to eight weeks but usually we've seen it about five weeks of implementation time because there's a lot of dependencies because your team also has to get closely involved with this implementation the other two approaches is one is the hosted approach which is technically a sub-domain something that you've done for rods dot com what you noticed in search for rods dot com is basically of course to the side and if you've rendered this page the other one is an ajax implementation that we saw on us patriot all you have done is you given as header the given is a footer right and this entire page is actually in html injuction
rep,this is like a very easy approach who actually going for value so this is one thing that we actually do because i can show you n number of slides monitor performance for the next 60 days and once you monitor performance and you're actually seeing value and for us value is if you're paying x to us should at least you have ten to fifteen x roi like if your conversion rate today say is two percent if we can't come in and including conversion by at least five to ten percent in the first iteration then a solution is not worth it and we are extremely confident that our solution will have that kind of impact and that's why the last years we've used this approach where you're challenged customers the belgium will come in as partners and tue value and this roi approch
rep,my name is ashish and i'm with unbxd how are you doing today.
prospect,great i'm jeff here and i'm here with don here.
rep,good morning don how are you.
prospect,i'm doing good how are you.
rep,i'm good thanks for asking so don i understand i think last time you spoke with sharath and sharath showed you the product demo unfortunately he's actually traveling today and he wanted me to jump on to this call and take you and jeff through the demo once again.
rep,i hope that's the agenda for the call is there anything else that you would want me to cover during the discussion i'll be more than happy to do that.
rep,okay great just give me a moment while i go ahead and share my screen do you see my screen all well.
rep,okay awesome great so here's the presentation we we made for etundra dot com and here's a quick agenda on high-level would want to discuss four things today. one talk to you talk a little about who we are two take you through the union's the state of the union on etundra dot com from our perspective and where we can come in and make a difference three will show you some of the site search problems that we solve today and lastly we can discuss any other details like like pricing implementation details or any other questions you might have.
rep,does that work for you.
rep,okay awesome great so to talk a little about us we are a five and half year old company headquartered in sunnyvale california with offices in chicago and india.
rep,we have our core engineering team work out of the sunnyvale office we do have our support and customer success and the sales team working out of chicago some of the back in engineering work also happens in india because we have a large presence in apac one of the largest search providers in apac.
rep,we have people working with us from microsoft twitter all search and and we are growing much faster than anybody else in this space with i would say now we are at 350 plus customer in the us and 1200 plus globally.
rep,here are some of our customers from an enterprise space target newegg dot com ashley home store express so ashley home store one of the largest furniture store in the us. neegg dot com close to 100 million plus products and still growing they have two million products changing every couple of hours so that so that shows that scale is surely not a problem with unbxd. from a brand perspective very niche speciality site that we work with deborah lippmann vac parts puravida bracelets sylvane. puravida bracelets sells only bracelets vac parts sells home appliance parts.
rep,on platforms we can integrate with any e-commerce platform be that one of the out of the box like magento shopify volusion netsuite or even be it a home grown e-commerce platform we have a platform agnostic solution that works with any e-commerce technology.
rep,so curious what what e-commerce platform do you use for etundra dot com.
prospect,it's <cross term> platform <from> microsoft technologies.
rep,okay awesome so we will surely not have any challenges so before we start today we picked up a few examples from the site and then i wanted to show you the opportunity with regards to product discovery and site search that we identified where we can come in and make a difference.
rep,and this is not to criticize anyone's work at your end it's just for us to kind of create a base in terms of how our technology can help you so i hope that's okay with you.
prospect,yes go on.
rep,okay great so first thing we look looked at the auto suggest or the auto guide the the the first interaction that the customer makes on the site is the auto suggest right the very the first few characters when they start typing in a search bar it's important to start guiding them to the right categories of products right products that or the the right brands depending on how you have classify your product catalogue today right.
rep,i do see that you do have some of the the feature but there could be much better way of guiding the customers and i'll show you some of the live examples in terms of how we approach with regards to guiding the customer from here and then opening up some of the products that they are more likely to buy.
rep,then we looked at the the relevancy beverage equipment like many other products that you have but kind of gives me very limited results then commercial dishwasher parts are so the result sets is surely not accurate right you'll notice the number of products that we have that that are available 42 versus the two two four twenty four thousand six hundred product if the customers are being opened up to.
rep,bar stool again the second product you'll notice is surely not a bar stool might be some sort of a part for bar stool but surely not bar stool and the customers <ways that> in terms of what they're looking for.
rep,rubbermad instead of rubbermaid right a spell spell check it does correct it just does come and come back and say that did you mean rubbermaid but does not start showing results.
rep,but even for rubbermade without an e the same thing and it's important to start showing the results in real time.
rep,so these are some of the examples that that we noticed and let me let me walk through the solution and show you how we approach some of these challenges relevancy or spell check and then there are category pages filter right how do we approach them and then before i get there right all of all of this is built on three things on very high level.
rep,business we understand the the retailer's business why customers buy there are a lot of competitors out there but there is something unique about you that brings those customers to your site and it's important to create that experience on your site right and then show them that you need them.
rep,and we built our solution or we customize our solution based on each retailers requirement to the technology we have solved several site search problems that are not solved before.
rep,be it a huge catalogue problem or i would say distributed catalogue based on geography based on what kind of people are coming onto your site and we have built a technology that is able to solve all of those challenges.
rep,and lastly the framework so you might be aware of these challenges you can go back to your system to kind of start solving you know start resolving these these challenges right away but what happens three months six months or say 12 months down the line when you when you click launch a new category a new brand new products onto your site.
rep,how do you ensure that from day one your site search is optimum so we provide the framework that takes care of it.
rep,let me not bore with these slides and then quickly actually take you through some of our live customer sites <> screen here do you see parts warehouse screen.
rep,okay great so parts warehouse they sells vacuum cleaner parts or other home appliance parts online before we came in they used to have two different search boxes for two different kind of visitors on their site one who knows exactly what part number to buy others who know the model of the home appliance and are looking for parts for those particular models right. we came in we said you can obviously not have two different search boxes because by doing so you're now putting the onus on the customer to select the right search box what if they select the wrong search box. and also at the back end you're doubling the problem of optimizing two different search boxes all together so instead what we built for them is something like this. the moment i start typing in the cell on the left hand side that you see all the parts for the cell on the right hand side all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for cell. here is another customer us patriot tactical they sell military apparels to us citizens for that for their site brand is very important and you'll notice the moment i start typing in ni it opens up nike one of the most popular brand on their site starting with ni some of the other some of the popular categories within nike and then nite ize or nite glow gear some of the other brands which are equally as good as nike. on the right-hand side start showing from the popular product this is dynamic based on the popularity the the order of the products would change so say if people are clicking on the fourth product more often the fourth product would come on top and the first one will go down based on the popularity.
rep,and then some of the top queries out here starting with ni. express went live i'm sure don maybe you have you would have probably not seen this on the last demo as it was was long back but express went live last month if i'm not wrong. so you'll notice the moment i start typing in jeans shows me jeans within various different categories and now when i browse through these each individual categories the images start changing and this is how the customer want it right they they felt that this is the the customers behavior on their site and it is important for them to show the products in this particular manner. then another customer not from your vertical but i wanted to show the breadth of our customization say big basket dot com second largest grocery store in the us sorry my bad in apac and they were in news few months ago for the two hundred million dollar funding. the challenge with the grocery store is that even if we look back at our groceries run we notice that we eventually buy similar 10 15 products every time we do grocery right the same milk bread egg they're similar kind of visitors on the site buying ten to fifteen products every time they did grocery. and it used to take sixty to seventy clicks for them to come onto the site search for the products go to the product page add to cart and checkout so instead what we've built for them is something like this.
rep,the moment i start typing in chicken you see all the chicken listings here with the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from the search box. some of the the commonly searched terms with chi some of the the categories within chicken and a banner for them to promote or show some of the deal that they might be running today not just that we added personalization to it. meaning if i was buying chicken liver more often i would see chicken liver on top while if you were buying say chicken with skin more often you would see chicken with skin on top so any any questions on <>.
prospect,no we don't.
rep,okay so you notice that all these customers are from different verticals they sell different kind of i would say product and and the kind of audience they have is all different right.
rep,so we understand their business we understand why customers buy buy from them and then we design this particular piece of auto suggest which kind of helps them to start guiding the customer from the very first interaction they made on the site.
rep,now this are the business piece on top of this what we've built is the technology right so before i get into the technology let me tell you something about the relevancy the relevancy is the key piece to site search it's very important to show the relevant products.
rep,before we started building the technology the founders actually spent quite some time almost a year doing research on two things one how people are searching online could be on e-commerce or on say google search or any other search and two what are the kind of product catalogs available out there right.
rep,they were called through various different products catalogues to see how these catalogues were defined right and based on these we defined the search query into 12 different types these are the only 12 types of queries that can occur on our for a product search.
rep,one say example exact search if i know the exact sku number part number model or the name of the product that's an exact search a feature search if i'm looking for say a red dress where red become the becomes a feature of the product dress.
rep,thematic search party dress the party is the theme of the product dress linguistic short cut i'm looking for a 50-inch tv and instead of i n c h i happened to type the double quotes that's a linguistic shortcut.
rep,natural language say gifts for toddlers right no products mentioned there but it's it's important for the system to understand the intent of the customer and then we built a relevant engine that was able to handle all these 12 different types of queries.
rep,on top of this what we built was the automated multi word spellcheck or an error tolerance system system it it's very common for the for the customers to to miss type or misspell something given they're coming from say tablet from their mobile screens which are much smaller right and even in general people tend to make spelling mistakes and it's important to immediately autocorrect them because the customers expect the site to do so.
rep,given they are so habitual of doing a search on say google or even for that matter amazon and they expect all of the other sites to react in the in the similar way so we built an error tolerance system that was able to handle misspelled query of up to six words with two alphabet misspelled in each word.
rep,here you'll notice black leather jacket all three are misspelled and in real-time we start showing the results we don't wait for the customer to click on something and confirm but we start showing them the results in real time any questions.
rep,great so <only> these spells check on the error tolerance what we also built was the stemming system the ability to handle the stemmed words synonymous words singular plural automatically you don't have to create any library at the backend anything that's available in the english dictionary is something that's taken care of.
rep,for example dress dresses the intent of the customer doesn't change primarily the customer is looking for the for the same kind of product it's important to start showing them the similar products and not change the order of the products just because they typed dress versus dresses right.
rep,same way other stemmed words could be game gaming center central cable cables laptop laptops or even for the spell check all sorts of spell check and synonymous synonymous words any synonymous word available in english section is something that handled automatically by unbxd.
rep,on top of this we do give you the ability to create synonyms but this is specifically for industry jargon so to give you an example for one of our customer who sells to the weight lifting world shoes are called lifters now there is no way we would know shoes are called lifters and also it wouldn't make sense for us to add that synonym into a corpus because lifters might mean totally different thing in in a different industry right.
rep,so in these corner cases words or terms which are very specific to your site to your industry we give you the ability to create the synonyms from our back end which is very easy without the help of the it team or a single line of code right.
rep,we give this ability to do from our dashboard and i will show you how easy it is to create synonyms.
rep,now automated redirect when you have something in your category page the best place to take someone is to that category page because category pages have the most curated set of results.
rep,so to give you an example sneakers sneakers right this is something that that automatically taken care of by unbxd but say for sandals you want to redirect them to sneakers this is something that then you can do from our back end.
rep,head query search when you have searches you know crossing multiple categories say mobile now we are not clear about the intent of the customer whether she is looking for a mobile phone mobile head phone headset cases covers.
rep,we have the technology to find the right category and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity right mobile mobile headphones cases covers <> but at in at the same time we start showing the results for the most obvious or the most popular category that being mobiles here.
rep,so we in real time we are showing mobiles but giving them the ability to browse through various different categories also over a period of time say people are clicking more often on mobile cases and covers then mobile cases and covers will come to position 2 and mobile headphones will go to position three.
rep,great let me <not shelter able to> let me show you a demo something that we built for outnet who sells designer wears or designer apparel do you see this the alexander wang example on the outnet site.
rep,do you see my screen the bucketed search results i just played a video actually hello hello jeff don you with me.
prospect,yeah we are here.
rep,okay were you are you able to see my screen the bucketed search results.
prospect,yeah i can see the screen.
rep,okay great so my bad so outnet who sells a lot of designer apparel right for them designers are very important so the moment i start searching for alexander wang who builds a lot of different various products could be totes or shoulder bag stresses shoes.
rep,we have the technology to start showing these products neatly bucketed into each category on the single page right giving giving the customer an ability to browse through all the products horizontally or vertically.
rep,then the other big differentiator that we bring onto the table is the dynamic filters right these filters are dynamic in nature in two ways so to give you an example say shoes now for shoes a particular set of filters is important or facets are important which could be say size ankle height width casual shoe type fastening.
rep,so if you define these filters for shoes as a category now irrespective of how i search be it men's casual shoe shoes formal shoes sometime customers might not even use the word shoes and and come in and say men's nike or men's adidas.
rep,as far as 75% or more results are from a particular category that being shoes here the shoes filters would automatically kick in right that's number one.
rep,number two let's say over a period of time people were clicking on width filter more often system understands that the width filter is more important than say size or ankle height and and based on the popularity width would come on position one and then size would move down given how often that particular filter is being used from that particular category.
rep,similarly if i was now looking for shirts men's casual shirts formal shirts the shirt filters would automatically come on the top any questions.
rep,great variances so if you do you sell products in variances which could be variants of colour size wherein you use a different variant image.
prospect,i am sorry.
rep,do you do you sell products which are variant in nature or which are in variances which could be of color or size.
prospect,we do but they're not necessarily organized the way today that the project we have coming up.
prospect,so right now each of those variants would be listed within the result <doesn't separate product but not group> .
rep,okay so once you have that group we have the technology to start showing the variance images even for search results so to give you an example here red dress someone searching for that dress all these dresses are available in red but the images that are being shown are the primary images for all of these products.
rep,giving customer a feel like these dresses might not be available in the red that's the only available in red right so if the red dress images are indexed in the in your products catalogue feed we have the technology to go and find to <create a variances> and start showing them here meaning all red dresses.
rep,also on top of this we have also built a colour synonymous corpus meaning i went to the site and look for a crimson dress if you have a crimson dress we start showing that.
rep,but if you do not have a crimson dress we understand that crimson is from the red colour family red garnet cherry rose ruby are much more closer colors to crimson and we start showing the other red color dresses and not the blues or the blacks or the or the browns.
rep,zero results page all the sites are going to have zero result pages could be various reasons you don't carry a product you don't carry a brand or say the site search query is so butcher that it's very difficult for for your automated system to understand the intent of the customer.
rep,we believe the onus is on us to start guiding the customers whenever they come across a zero result query and we do this in real-time and highly personalized for each user by placing these two widgets.
rep,recently viewed these are some of the products that the customer would have viewed so far on the site this gives them the ability to go back in their product discovery journey.
rep,now based on their affinity towards a brand towards a color towards a category price point we start recommending these products in real time for each user right.
rep,some of the products that that they are more probable to buy and then start showing them as site recommendations.
rep,similar products so there could be 100 reasons why i like the shoes it could be the color the pattern the style the designer the price point we see the customers they <objected> to immediately evaluate similar products.
rep,click on see similar products open up a modal window customer likes the other similar products they can click on it they don't they close the model and go back onto the search results same thing on mobile site.
rep,so do you have a mobile site is that adaptive responsive.
rep,so all these features would work on a responsive site now more like this if it gives the customer an ability to quickly evaluate some of the other similar products on a smaller mobile screen where they cannot browse or they can look at multiple pages for the products.
rep,mobile auto suggest examples scope suggestions recent searches which are highly personalized for each user category refinement again gives gives you the ability to limit the number of results you want to see on a smaller screen shoes men women boys and then further they can filter the category.
rep,and then multi select filters the ability to to select multiple filters on a mobile screen to limit the number of results or the products that someone want to see.
rep,so what i've shown you so far are three out of the five things that i wanted to talk about today one was the business piece the auto suggest pience that is that we show how customized it could be two the technology which is the relevancy the synonym corpus stemmed words <variously> and then lastly we spoke about the filters and the dynamicness of these filters on mobile and desktop.
rep,now i would want to show you two more things one is our dashboard and two the reporting so let me just take you to the live dashboard actually do you see the unbxd dashboard screen.
rep,okay great so the solution unbxd search solution right we believe that we can take the product discovery experience to 90% and the remaining 10% experience is something that we would want you to be control to have the controllers right.
rep,because you know your business well you know what are your high margin products you know what are your high inventory products or what are your <seeing> products.
rep,and that's where we give you the ability to kind of overwrite some of the rules or some of the search results that unbxd would show and i'll show you how you could do that so here is the dashboard for this particular demo site that we've built once you have your catalog uploaded we would have all the information in terms of how many products you have what the feed size like.
rep,we can also manage multiple domains multiple sites from a single login could be a live site or testing site that you can manage from here these are the product catalog to use we made them all searchable non searchable which tuned it up for you any in-site live but you will have complete visibility in terms of how the site is configured.
rep,here you can configure any facets or filters so to give you an example say price and then you can select an option you can take choose a price field from catalog and create a pattern.
rep,and then synonym so synonyms once again to reiterate you do not have to create synonyms for synonymous words or misspelled words this is only for industry jargons that you would want to create.
rep,to give you an example say lifters and let me make it as bi-directional shoes create synonyms and you're done thats how simple it is to create synonyms then the merchandising dashboard.
rep,and let me show you how you can merchandise for search let me just delete some of these old ones here you can set any global rules say always promote high inventory products always promote high margin products a particular brand may be your own brand always promote home brand products do not show out of inventory.
rep,so any any rule that is applicable to all your search queries globally you can set them up here but let me show you merchandising for a particular query that will give you a complete perspective in terms of how you could use the dashboard.
rep,so what we see on the website today for dress let me go to the website dress and you see these products the first two blue dresses and a striped dress and then the brown dress when i go to the dashboard i see the same thing the first two blue dresses the stripped and the brown dress right.
rep,so these these are all dresses these are surely not shoes or sandals or jackets right that's that's like what i meant by taking exclaims to 90% they're based on the popularity or or you know how popular they are basically or how good are they in terms of their conversions but you might want to still go and overwrite this and and you can do this in various ways.
rep,so to give you an example you can filter you can filter by say margin or you can filter by a particular brand particular size a particular category or say run promotions you can sort you can boost so to show you an example say let's boost brand contains eliza all the eliza dresses are now moved to top.
rep,even within this say this dress white dress is your latest just add it to the catalog you want this on top you can drag and drop in product this is your high inventory dress and you want this on the second position you can drag and drop and <tape it product> <missing texts> you can also add banners to this personalized page.
rep,you can insert a image url or landing page url or through html and you will notice that all of these changes occur on the site in real time.
rep,theses are the first two dresses we pin and these are the other two dresses the ralpg lauren dresses that we had sorted to be on fifth and sixth position.
prospect,when you are publishing a banner or some sort of ad in the sorts where you can place that.
prospect,for example on some site something which they can place an ad instead of the product <>.
rep,so there are two things here when you say product right do you do you mean to say start recommending products for this particular query.
prospect,no just want to have a promotion for all dresses you wanted them to publish and have unit degree in communicate that done better in their specific no nor page banner would have no control.
rep,no so yeah so you will have the control right all we would do is we would render that particular banner right so you define where you want to have that that's the ability that you will have and then we will start showing the right banner for the <>.
rep,does that answer your questions.
prospect,the banners that you show up at the top or the bottom of the page or can you replace product in the <banner> with a brand.
rep,we can replace.
prospect,we can.
rep,yes so the banner can be can be positioned anywhere on the site that goes well with your ui right how you define the ui that's how the banner can be placed.
rep,let me show you how you can also create landing pages so say clearance right let's look look at the site what's in clearance now today we don't have anything in clearance on the site.
rep,so we can come back here and say clearance create rule merchandise obviously there is nothing on the on the site in clearance today so doesn't show up anything convert to landing page click ok this opens up the complete catalog for us to start basically populating results for this particular campaign.
rep,and then you can run the similar boost say boost brand contains eliza and then you can again pin products and then add banners again on for this particular page and then if i go back here the moment i hit clearance you see the same set of results are on the catalogue and you can sorry on the dashboard and now you can take this particular url and start using them for your seo campaign email marketing campaigns or any other marketing campaigns.
rep,now let me quickly show you how you can merchandize category pages so say for men as a category i could click merchandize add banners for particular category pages and then the facets so if you remember i showed you the dynamic filter site this is where you can define filters for men as a category now i want to say hide under category filter.
rep,i can click on it and say hide i want size filter on top i can drag and drop that on position one and i one price filter on position two i can drag and drop that on position to i can show filters hide filters in those and then manage that here.
rep,now irrespective of how someone is searching as far as 75% or more results are from men as a category these filters would automatically kick in.
rep,so that's the merchandising the next piece i want to show is reporting but before i move to reporting any questions on merchandizing.
rep,so what are you use for reporting today is that google analytics or any other tool that you use for reporting.
prospect,google analytics.
rep,okay great so with solutions like google analytics the challenge is say i come to your site start searching for something i don't find it and then i start navigating and eventually buy given my session started with search the the google analytics will still show that as a search conversion.
rep,but in reality it was not a search conversion search could not help me find the right product i went to navigation and eventually bought right so it's the a navigation conversion or a browse conversion.
rep,and we kind of we've built a technology that is able to monitor that there are 2 kind of report that accurately in terms of what your search conversions were versus what your browse conversion were.
rep,here are your high-level reports in terms of what your top search query were top products added to cart what are your top zero result query even top click products these are very high-level executive overview for someone to understand how the site is performing today.
rep,and this can be looked for a particular period of time you can change the time period here could be one week one month one year based on what kind of data you want to look at and these reports are available for you to download in csv or an xl.
rep,now the next level of reporting is detailed query query report right so all your queries listed for a particular period of time again as i defined them all the queries here with details on their heads click-through ctr conversions orders then you can click on say for the query dresses and you can get a trendline in terms of how the query has been performing over a period of time.
rep,now say we are here today and the query started not performing over a couple of days then the merchandiser now knows that they need to go back to merchandising a stack merchandising this particular query to show more appropriate results.
rep,also this will give you the products which are related to this particular query what kind of products are showing up and what each of their views or click ranks.
rep,and then on the flip side product level reporting all your products which have category manager managing a particular set of products they can come here they can look at each and individual product and their performance in terms of views and added to cart.
rep,and then when they click on that particular product then it shows them again a trendline in terms of sell and how the product have been performing.
rep,and what are the queries that this product show up and what are the kind of orders so that's the reporting and all these reports are available as a download on csv or excel.
rep,so that's the solution gentleman you like it not like it something you would want to try just curious.
prospect,definitely great there is a lot of feature improving what we have today and <no text availabe> calls with other vendors who is starting her budgeting timeframe for next year within the next month month half.
prospect,so we're just starting to like at the due diligence process if you ever prepared to plan what we're going to do next but i don't think we're at a point to make any type of decision quite yet.
prospect,we will likely have some follow-up questions related features technical implementation as well as pricing but we cann't <> about a quarter or next couple of month.
rep,okay good so how far are we like one month two months before the holidays when when do you want to get started with the new i would say decide search solution on the site.
prospect,i don't think we would actually something this year for the the <understudy>  we are however unredeemed the platform we built our time for the custom platform we built and i think you roll that out to some of the other brands in our holding company.
prospect,we would likely search a new search solution within the platform to support those brands before we actually <> but that's still probably a q1 2013 thing.
rep,okay i get that so you know we would be more than happy to connect with you whenever you are ready to look at implementing something of this sort.
rep,but the last thing that i also want to put here on the table was that the guaranteed conversions like no one else provides in the market so we guarantee our customers a conversion uptick of up to 10% in the first 90 days of implementation.
rep,over a period of one year say six months to one year customers have also seen an uptick of twenty to thirty percent in their conversions so that's the kind of guarantee that we provide and you have no long-term commitments with us for the first 60 days.
rep,you can try our solution and have the ability to walk out of the contract at any given point in time if you don't like the solution and it could be anything so you're not seeing conversions your you are not having the performance of the site sirs you can just walk out of the contracts with no commitments.
rep,post 60 days we give you the ability to make a decision whether you want to continue with unbxd on a longer term which could be a 1 year long contract or not and then that's that's probably performance driven.
rep,if our customers don't see our performance we are more than happy to let them go but so far we have not lost a customer.
prospect,no we saw we certainly appreciate what we saw this morning.
rep,yes i'll send it out i'm not sure if sharath sent it to don last time but i'll send it out.
rep,great thank you guys.
prospect,yeah i did.
rep, okay perfect so just a quick recap i run sales here and one of our product evangelists here on the west coast so i manage a lot of the accounts from la and oregon and up to colorado.  so i'm doing a lot of that travelling around so i appreciate the time that not only have to booth but here today and i know at the booth we went over via mobile in terms of how that is optimized for your site so what i did today though was took a look at you were a desktop site.  and went through that to kind of see you know where we can see some some levels of improvement not any type of you know
rep,isn't saying it wrong or right which is where we see some optimization here does that work.
prospect, okay <something is loading>.
rep, something is loading.
prospect, yeah kind of jump <> page.  okay we're back.
rep, alright okay so set the agenda for today just a little talk about who we are talking about brief study of your current site that we did with with with you guys for you guys just our approach how we're different in terms of other vendors and just kind of the opportunity for unbxd to be a partnership with you guys and then the roi what's that value bring to you and then possible next steps of <rra>.
rep, in terms of who we are so so we're really a product discovery technology company so we've been around for about five years now
prospect, okay.
rep,have about 1200 customers globally have 120 somewhat brands here in north america and really what's great is that we're powering over 1 point 5 billion interactions per month.
rep, in all sorts of verticals and all sorts of sectors right so to look at fashion for example you probably know of express and maybe rue 21 in in a hardware space we have ib supply which is b2b and parts warehouse where it may have some some synergies with you guys and i'll show you what we did for it with them in terms of how we optimize their their search.  if you look at across the board whether it be electronics grocery on home improvement we have customers in each one whether it be ashley or hh gregg bed bath and beyond.
rep, and i know that you got hannah now you you and i chatted earlier today and you guys are on a homegrown e-commerce platform.  so that's something that we can definitely work with we work with platform agnostic so even if you're not on the magento or may be ibm mysphere which we have here we can we could still work with you.
rep, how long have you been on this this homegrown system.
prospect, i'm not quite sure but i think it's about five seven years it's.
rep, okay wow it's a it's a long time so yeah so it's something that we can definitely work with.
rep, now that homegrown is it like a dot net platform or.
prospect, <> dot com.
rep, okay got it we work with ib supply they had a homegrown e-commerce site and that was a dot net kind of platform and we are yet to integrate with them in six weeks i believe in terms of getting them up and running.  so from that perspective we definitely have <> to do so most of the customers that we're working with we see a huge increase we do guarantee a 10 percent but we're seeing anywhere from 23 up to you know sixty percent in terms of increase in conversion.  so that's something to take a look at now bill and we built that out live for you as well so we could take a look at what will you be coming for you.
rep,and any questions so far.
prospect, nothing so far.
rep, so again let me take a look at the brief study that we got we'd get on your site i mean based on our conversations this is something you're probably already aware of.
rep, but in terms of search right is there a particular reason at this particular time weather isn't any autosuggest and the reason why i asked that question is because autosuggest is typically the first in your interaction you have with your customers right it's the first opportunity where you guide them to the product they're looking for or expose them to other products that they may not be familiar with within that same within that same brand so is there something that you guys are looking at doing.
prospect, yeah absolutely i told you earlier but we work with a digital marketing agency and they kind of help out with some of the different projects we can work on to improve our website and to have more optimization involved those are one of the search functions and optimising and that's one of the projects that's in queue.  but we just haven't really gotten around to it in terms of e-commerce on or website isn't the highest closing account if you can imagine i said amazon so i think a lot of our focus tends to be on amazon so our website kind of sometimes takes a it kind of goes to the back a little bit.
prospect, so we haven't been prioritizing some of the projects risk of real <classics> dot com but we definitely would like to and search would be one of the top priority projects for us.
rep, a curiosity how much is the revenue driven from the dot-com versus amazon would you say that this dot-com says anywhere between 20 to 30 percent or is it a lot lower in terms of maybe 10 or 15% versus products that are on amazon.
prospect, well <> you want me to tell you about the website alone.
rep, yeah just the website alone.
prospect, well it would be around 10%.
rep, yeah got it so 10% of the revenue got it okay and can you share in terms of what your online revenue is.
prospect, we can't share you the details but we can share the range.
rep, okay yeah what would be the range that's fine i don't need to exact details.
prospect, okay so the range for the e-commerce revenue is between 25.
rep, okay great yeah between 25 million yeah that's what i yeah that's what we that's what i projected as.  so again let me show you some of the things that we came up with obviously you're aware that you don't have a suggests here so i did a couple of different examples here where i put drawers a stool or a kitchen there wasn't any guided here so we're putting we're putting really a lot of the oddness to of the customer to kind of figure out you know where to go.  so what
rep,could we do with auto-suggest right what are some of the things that we can do well with express for example what we did here is we created a jaw drop down where they if they create they type in jeans not only are we showing them jeans but we're also showing them self categories where that be for women or for men but also blue jeans or jeans.
rep, and what's great what's really cool about this is that this actually change it so today i did jeans black last week and you see blue jeans but last week if the most popular was white jeans.  so these kind of queries our machine learning will really kind of create a personal relationship with how your customers are browsing because it'll give you the top queries.
prospect, and then on the site where it's as popular in jeans you guys didn't do that part right.
rep, we did this entire part here so what happens is work we're actually grabbing these images a lot of everything that we're doing is from our machine learning so we have a popular in women or jeans.  and these 300 so even though we're loading the images we actually load in 300 milliseconds so yes we are doing this.
prospect, so as far as the design layout goes is that the express already had or is that something you guys suggested one of the features.
rep, so i'm not sure if we actually did the actual design of the layout we <>.  i can answer to that if you want.  i'm sorry <> who was that.  i can answer that if you want.  okay go ahead.
rep, yeah so i think we'll cover this little later but we will work with you to make sure the design of your site is matches the search result design.
prospect, okay okay.  yeah i mean you know one one of the things that we'd like to see from from your solution is that if you guys are finding that our consumer may find that it's easier to have this segment to  where there's these pictures on the topic popular near and you guys are rotating them and that's something we could definitely consider increase your the site. conversion rate maybe this is something that we're obviously not seeing that's beneficial to other companies but if you guys can suggest this through the
prospect,conversion then yeah i mean oh i mean they'll be really good for us.
rep, yeah so this is something that does increase conversion just because the layout is easy to guide the customer into looking for products that they're actually searching for so what we do is really focus on the antenna.  and we'll talk a little bit about this more in the presentation and we'll show you how some of these layouts are actually increasing conversion for a lot of our customers so this is just one way to do it but i'll show you several different ways to do it.
rep, any other questions on that.
prospect, no we're good.
rep, so as you can see here i just want to show you another suggestion why because we've managed to actually changes the image and if you look at cropped it it does the same thing as well so again not only is it displaying different types of subcategories but it can actually display the image as well.
rep, in terms of spelling are you guys managing this manually when i did wastebasket for for on your site it gave me zero search results but if i did waste basket it did give me search results so what are you guys doing in terms of manage managing spelling.
prospect, we're not doing anything in terms of spelling and so for each item we can enter as many keywords or search terms as we want so we could add it in but it's not it's just not something we thought about so it's not something that's been implemented.
rep, and we'll talk about how we do this i mean 85% of the work is actually automated through unbxd to help you with these different spelling issues.  so again i did laundry
rep,sorters as you as you know without a spelling well algorithm knows there there's nothing to to look at so we brought up zero results we looked at stemming right shelving versus shelves we had different results one was in terms of the navigation you could look at shelving but if i did search on shelves it didn't bring any type of relevant results here.  workbench with a space versus workbench brought in different results as well something that we could take a look at and talk about how we handle stemming stemming without machine learning here gives you zero a lot of zero results and again what happens with a lot of these zero results increases the abandonment.
rep, so you may not i know that you're not taking analytics right now on-site search or those conversions but you're also probably not aware of how much business you're actually leaving on the table by not having something that guides the customer will call of action when they have the results and we'll talk about what we do as well.  in terms of relevance right being able to look at saddled hook and hook set they may be
prospect, right.
rep,the same thing they may be intertwined but they're different results or i'm not getting the right relevant products of the intent of the customers to look at a hook but we're giving them on products that aren't relevant to that search.
rep, in terms of organizer organized cart organizer cart wide versus white organizer i did here and what's what's what i want to point out here is that these are actually your top searches so when we looked at the search results i got 0 found but if you look at the url it's actually one of your top searches so the fact that you're getting zero search results meaning that you're not able to convert on these popular products.
rep, is that something you were aware of.
prospect, no we were not.
rep, yeah something that definitely thought that the wood would point out because that is sense that that will increase or decrease your conversions in terms of that the other thing that we we looked at your speed test.  so we did a speed test of one of your top searches right and typically what we guarantee in terms of sla is a 300 millisecond so what you're seeing here is actually four times the the speed in terms of loading it here on the west versus there on the east right so something that we wanted to take a look at in terms of optimization in terms of that especially those being in the top searches they're very slow.
rep,the total category redirects right you have you built these categories you know which products they should be be going to in terms of your navigation so if i navigate to commercial bin racks right you have these lists of racks that are available to the customers but if i typed in the search commercial bin racks i get zero items found.  so throughout these analyzation if you will look i've got we got a lot of zero results so there's some things that we definitely want to optimize a square as we're going to decide how we are going to do so.  product type search without machine learning again we put steel wire shelving here
rep,um the results some of those were were weren't relevant in terms of that recommendations there isn't really anything that says hey after you get a three pack of mesh waste bagage waste basket or there any like product similar.  it's like which you would do with amazon there isn't <clear sale> upsell opportunities here so something you want to take a take a look at as well.
rep, and then personalization stalls the search you know results be the same so whether you're navigating through a through your taxonomy right with with the through your site or whether you're searching the results really should be the same.  because what you would know which products should be at the forefront whether those products are the gross tires gross margin whether the most popular or or if you want to promote those for that particular week.  what happens is if you have those products and you leave it out to search
rep,that product that you are merchandising as number one through the taxonomy to the navigation and it searches up as number three when you search isn't gonna give you the the optimization you need to get that out the door.
rep, so the results really should be the same don't leave it up to search to guess and this is where we have the ability through our machine learning through our merchandising tool to ensure that these are things that you get the right products to your customers.
rep, any questions are on this so far.
prospect, no i think we're good.
rep, so let's talk about our approach and why are customers going with with unbxd especially when site search is so important so typically site search we've seen drives anywhere between twenty to forty percent of the revenue for most e-commerce site.
rep, and what we did with express is we were able to create such an impact on their site search and conversion and the revenue that david kornberg the president & ceo in their q2 earnings just a few weeks ago noted that the capabilities that provide the visual recommendations are merely to the users increased increase the conversion rates right.
rep, so it really tells you the top level that they're looking at this and how much of an impact that search can actually be to your overall business right and then also on the flip side of that is 80% of your visitors will abandon if they have a core search experience.  so even though you may be in the 2 to 5 million range you can potentially increase that by acts by having a search site search where you're guiding your customers for a product similar to but what you're doing on the amazon site.  so why unbxd right well we feel that each business
rep,that we deal with is a customized approach there's an cookie cutter approach so we search and we customized it to your business so what's good for you guys isn't good for target what's going for target doesn't mean it's good for you guys.  so from a business perspective we sit down and we analyze and we understand exactly what's going on with your business we have the technology through machine learning through personalization well we actually understand the intent of the search.  what i mean by that is most the time when you're doing searches through other whether it be a homegrown or
rep,whether it be one of the other vendors is that look they look at a text-based search.  so if they look at black leather jacket they would look at anything that has black or leather or jacket versus the intent of the actual search where it's actually black leather jacket and we'll get to that in terms of of how we do that.  we have the merchandising tool where it gives you the ability to manage your business right you know which products which relationship vendors you have what kind of things you want to get out the out the door whether that be again either it's margin or even if you want to do a
rep,clearance you have these merchandising controls.  and not only that it gives you the analytics that you don't have today that you're not taking invent in terms of the top queries top zero results you know being able to have that data so you can optimize not only for today but also for you know six weeks from now or 30 days from now or a year from now as you're creating more products and as your as your site grows right.  talked about mobile a couple of weeks ago and
rep,optimizing that as a channel and again we have that sla for conversion we have the guarantee of a ten percent conversion as well as a 300 millisecond response time for for searches.  so that's why people are choosing unbxd any any questions so far.
prospect, nothing let's go ahead.
rep, so in terms of while we've seen a immediate impact and where we've seen a immediate impact if you look at this particular site right before unbxd for express if they typed in blue jeans you saw a lot of different products that showed up that weren't really relevant to blue jeans.  you saw shirts and you saw women and you saw men versus that drop-down where you actually saw the categories and the subcategories of jeans right.  so after unbxd we've actually seen an increase in revenue by sixty percent within the first 90 days and how
rep,do we that through machine learning through personalization and by the contextual search where it's actually looking at the intent of the actual customer versus just doing an and or text based search.  any questions on the before and after with express.
prospect, so if i search blue jeans today for example i was on express website and i looked at blue jeans but have more specific and i've been strolling around express and search that for say left to me and and hannah comes along and types of jeans now this is a first time going unexpressed well the machine know she show us two different different blue
rep, yes it's gonna personalize it for your on how you have been navigated what you've been searching and understand how you're interacting with the site and
prospect,jeans.
rep,then when hanna comes on she'll get a personal as a personalized experience but if she types in blue jeans for example our machine learning will know that will display the popular searches that come up.  so then that she can look at exactly what was more relevant right.
prospect, okay okay.
rep, so it creates a personal experiences for each user.
rep, so some of the business impact that we've seen with customers in all the different vector sectors whether you look at furniture at home we've seen a 60 percent increase in conversions.  if you look at all the way into fashion for example we've seen a 10 percent a sixty percent so this gives you a lot of different it gives you some visibility and how we are comparing the before and after with with some of our customers. this is why we we're very confident in terms of guaranteeing a 10 percent no other company can do that and we're confident because we understand the space were in the e-commerce company we specialize in working with your particular business and half of the learning has already done through our
rep,technology the other half is done through machine learning as your shoppers interact with your site.
prospect, you guys your platform gets to measure they of course are analyzing we get to see how much of revenue we've generated based on our testing time period.
rep, yeah so in terms of a poc you mean.
rep, yeah so we'll be able to look at your<>.  who's that.  yeah so what happens there is we look at your google app you probably have google analytics or something like that installed and that those google analytics on your site to help you measure the effectiveness of our platform.
prospect, okay <> see the information from there.
rep, we work with you also google analytics on using your site and our implementation team will work with you and we all will look at the same set of data.  so where you're at right now and then we'll analyze that over the course of that 90 day period and you'll see you'll see an uptick in conversion within the first two weeks of the implementation yeah.
prospect, okay good to know.
rep,and i think and just to reiterate this point where i think is a very important point last column on this slide is the most important column where you see across  yeah. different verticals revenue going up 35% 29% for 14% by 22% so that's the most important column and that's the revenue increase that you can expect within sixty to ninety days of signing the contract.  any any further questions on that.
prospect, no we got that.
rep, so in terms of this technology and how these components are put together right what it what is that involved we're talking about the relevancy algorithm we're talking about how the user intent means right versus how if looking at what the customer searching versus just looking at a text-based search.  where it's looking at black or leather or jacket we know that the black leather jacket black is the colour leather as the fabric and a jacket is is the is the product right.  and then our machine learning is based on spell correction and stemming outside
rep,the box so all these manual manual words that you would normally have to manage 85% of those are already taken in account outside the box.  so it's nothing that you have to manage it's already automated another ten and fifteen percent is if some which is it really bad or if there's specific words that are specific to your vertical for example in in weightlifting lifters or considered shoes right so those specific synonyms and and those could be included manually.  again we talked about that personalization what's really cool though in terms of our personalization
rep,and how our machine learning works is that let's say i was purchasing a jacket from chicago  versus san francisco right not only does it look at the intent of the search.  but it also looks at the geo-location of where the customer is looking at and bring up the most popular and relevant jackets because they probably want a thicker jacket in chicago versus one here in san francisco or la so these are some of the things that we talk about in terms of personalization and machine learning.
prospect, so for example with our unions arguments are our pocket line definitely tailored to different demographics teenagers college students women men with a garage line let's say for example someone bought our garage lines over on the east coast we're really known for a shoving would would that appears if he came back on a website and based on our extensive line of shoving.  would the system tell them with the system first probably to the moles or like the super-sized shoving rather than the small homes on shoving with people to know that or we have to set better parameters <>.
rep, so there's a couple of ways you want to do it you can do it right yes our machine learning will know exactly what the most popular shoving in that region is and bring up the most relevant results right you can do it that way.  or if there's something that you want to be able to promote whether that be on the east or the west or what not a particular product that gives you the best margin you can do that through much mission arm our merchandising workbench and promote those as well.
rep, so either or you can either automate that where you can actually manually configure that through our workbench.
prospect, okay yeah i really really like how the this system can learn and we can really bring a heavy-duty serving unit to the customer within the first search then that would be even better beginning like our line of shopping is because those range pretty expensive range.
rep,and merchandising workbench is really really good because you know your products you know which ones are the most popular you know what your customers want and so you can boost those products you can promote those products you can slot those products as people are searching and have control over that.  and still work with not only you have the ability to have the machine learning learn and personalize but you can also manually put those products to the forefronts as well.
rep, we talked about mobile in terms of mobile optimizations in the last call or last meeting that we had how we can improve some of those things and again we have smart auto-suggest where we can guide the use right it's the first impressions in terms of how the minute with your site. that's why amazon is so popular in terms they <> the would we transact and convert and convert very high <> personalized if you use a skill but different suggestions based on how you're searching and then the ui is really tailored to your business and what works best for you.
rep, and some of these are the components that we also talked about when we talk about recommendation right we have these personalization widgets that we can recommend for you similar to what you have do at amazon right.  these buy these products or you also you know people as i've also viewed this are also bought this or top sellers or even catalogue based widgets were have cart recommendations or more like this so we have these widgets from a recommendations perspective that you can implement.
prospect, and it can be implemented even if we're not on like a magento right.
rep, yes.
rep, so the these widgets so recommendations is based going to be based on impression so there is an additional cost for this i mean but you have access to all of the different recommendation widgets it's just it will leap the way we cost it out is basically based on impressions.
prospect, great.
rep, so let's about we talked about a couple different things let me show you some some sites and to get out of these powerpoint is sometimes you never want to be just dead by powerpoint right.  so let me take a look at us page can you guys see my site my my screen by a chance.  okay so one of the things that we did you know.
rep, alan we're still seeing the business powerpoint slide we're not seeing the internet site right now.  one second.  i think first get out of powerpoint show mode slide mode go to normal mode then then yes got it. can you guys now see a google chrome.
prospect, not yet still on the business slide.
rep, okay.  can you guys see now.
prospect, no no not yet.
rep,vivek can you see it.  no alan i can't you have to first go to part wine and garrulous light mode i am out of powerpoint mode and i have you sharing you guys should be seeing my screen hopefully.
prospect, no no we just we still see the flag i'm not even in that top claim okay i'm
rep,just gonna go to the pack but that's fine i don't want to take up any more the time we'll just go to this all right can you guys see you the next slide that know what's going on here you know when you see it the thing the powerpoints like right now you see the powerpoint yeah yeah yeah no let's go you i should have gone i went to date the next slide so you guys see the next slide where it says sports apparel should we try professional page mm-hmm let me try it something else i'm sharing the screen i'm sharing the powerpoint let me just stop and then let me go back and press play again what do you guys see now.  okay we see we see three different popcorn slide this is at the top left you see then we see a button called swap screens just click on that
rep,button swap system.
prospect, okay i see the sports apparel.
rep, alright so what we did here i'm just want to give you some different examples so what we did here for us patriot well when you type in ni they're most popular search is nike right but it also could be nite ize or nite glow or nite vision so it exposed to not not only the most popular product but it is also exposing them to products that they may not be aware of as well.
rep, so this is even though it's a broad search we gave them the ability to put in non nike products and also if you look at the below here you actually see the top queries and you also see the most popular queries.  and what's great about this is that let's just say this nike sfp wasn't the most popular a week from now let's say it was this this one this will actually move to the top and go to the forefront so it will continue to be dynamic in terms of how it interacts with your site so again it delivers the minimum within milliseconds even though we're displaying images.
rep, another one we did we just showed you express over already again another auto-suggest feature we did for prestige man so if you type in ping here again it gives you a different view it gives you the other colours in that
rep,particular category i don't look yes.  alan alan yet we aren't seeing the next slide and current slide view of powerpoint on the top left you will see a button called swap to play this place.  i did that and you guys were seeing that before so i'm not sure let's do that click that swap displays one more time.  yeah okay nothing is ending.
rep, i'm sorry.  okay all right keep going this is the best we can do at this point.  are you guys able to see all because there are two different slides come up right now the current stack are you able to see the screen clearly.
prospect, i am viewing on my laptop.
rep, that's fine so here you can look at deborah lippmann here it has the different suggestions here and also all the best sellers if you look at how we can customize the ui look at this for example you have the scope suggestions here on the left.  and you have the category brands so it when you're asking you know how can i improve my conversion what are some of the ui enhancements that we could do and i just wanted to give you some different examples especially when you're looking at such a broad query when you're too we'll get that and here's the a suggestion in terms of how you can do that whether that be a vertical or a horizontal approach.
rep, i'm sorry what was  <>. the question.
prospect, what are the suggestions you are saying i just saw one from the example.
rep, the scope suggestions.
rep, so we know so so we have a scope suggestions here based on bed and then he have bed bath here and then you have a category of subject brand suggestions here within the ui.  so the question is what are the scope suggestions is that the question.
prospect,i just wanted to see what's the suggestions are.
rep, so some of the scope suggestions there were bed bath in home perimeter insect bed frame instance perhaps is that the question.
prospect, i'm okay so you are <> all of these suggestions right.
rep, correct.
prospect, okay alright i wonder how that's something on automatically on our end once we use it and i understand.
rep,no problem that's why i want to keep it as interactive as possible it is the right questions no problem.  any other questions on that.
prospect, no.
rep, awesome here's a different way of doing things so we work with a grocery very large grocery brand and what happens here was that they typically had about i want to say 60 to 70 clicks in terms of their interactions with their customers.  they knew exactly what they were gonna buy they bought the same kind of products all the time and so what we did here is if you look at that when they type in chi or this could be chicken right it looks at the top searches for them in terms of what they're buying so you can actually go from cheese to look at the add the amount of quantity and then add it directly to the shopping cart.
rep, so we minimize it from 60 clicks to 14 or 17 different clicks not only that is that we put in a banner the top query suggestions popular brands and in cheese as well as the different categories as well.  so again we're looking at a lot of the relevancy in what we're bringing to the customer so you can not only convert higher but put the opportunity for them to pull buy more products.
rep, any questions on that and i know that they're not in the same space but i wanted to give you a different ideas of what we've done for other customers.
rep, so again again you asked you know how should i customize the ui i'm here's different approaches one for frozen on a toy site versus two frozen on a on a grocery site right we have the different departments that are you can buy food from and then up vertical in terms of the ice cream and then you have all the products or for the toy so it just gives you different options in terms of how you want to do a ui.
rep, this doesn't really apply to you guys because there's not a whole lot of brands that are that are like this but if you wanted to do let's just say for mobile in this particular case mobile has different categories whether it be mobile headphones or mobile cases or whatnot.  so what we did we said we put let's put the top matching categories at the top and then the most popular products that are associated to that category on the bottom and these will change over time as you interact with your products visual approach instead of having a drop-down or a bunch of products products that you have to scroll through when they're just images.
rep, in terms of bucket search so when you have one product that can overlap a lot of different categories for example in this alexander wang they sell put tote bags and dresses and boots we can actually create a way to create these categories and subcategories but navigating it in a way or it's a lot more intuitive again giving the customer the ability to guide through products that they may be interested in and when you have such a wide search.
prospect, one of my experience right now just by looking at this something that even in processing we're also working on for quite some time now about our website and making it more user friendly i have a feeling that your ui is going to tell us to very much <> shapes an entire layout of our websites just because right now it's not very friendly towards users.  i think the mobile has an advantage to the desktop site is that something that you guys foresee as well i mean we talked about going through a different like a digital platform at one point in time but our company works a little more slowly and we take little steps.
prospect, i think that you know in using unbxd you guys are gonna come back and tell us that we're probably gonna have to make way out design adjustments and which will require our web developer.
rep, yes we'll.  no no absolutely not we make the search ui look very similar to better to your current ui because we want the consumer to have one seamless experience and be part of your complete journey of the customer from navigation to to search to recommendation to add to cart.  we want user to have one seamless experience so that is why alan started this presentation he spoke about we customize it to your business so we don't just dump our
rep,engine on your doorstep we will actually do a review call with you.  and the first six weeks is all about understanding your business understanding of ui understanding what what products sell and what are the trends and what are the top priorities and what are the top ui concerns you have and mapping to  and one of the things we want to show you with diversity is we don't have one engine ui we have ui that matches to the site. those.
prospect, ok ok good ok.
prospect,because ultimately what we're proposing to the owner is we're investing in unbxd and this is how much it's going to cost us and he's giving ok well i'm a little reluctant but i'm gonna go with it later on we come to tell them that unbxd suggesting that we do all the design changes which then would require our web developer which then will now cost a lot more money.  like one eats on this ahead of time so yeah i like your approach and we can't just go over
prospect,this go ahead in the beginning <>.
rep, absolutely.  right so this is basically another opportunity in terms of just looking at the engagement of customers probably not more not as relevant to you guys but if you were looking at a particular product in this particular it's it's a shoe and for whatever reason they could have 100 million reasons of why they liked it and be able to look at it another view of other similar products.  if they want to switch and buy pulls the plus kills and stay they can do that or one on navigating go back they can just exit out so again you're continuing to navigate the
rep,customer and keep it make it simple.
rep, so we've talked about you know some other things that we've done for customers and we took a look at your site now let's talk about a little bit about the technology what we're doing.  and really kind of what we've done is we've looked at hundreds and thousands of different queries we looked at tons of how shoppers are actually uncertain and really what it came down to twelve simple queries that get your products to the customer at the right time.  absolutely what it comes down to versus looking at an n or a text-based type of approach where you look at black dresses
rep,but it only searches for anything that's either black or dresses and gives you some irrelevant results right so what we're looking essentially is the intent of the customer.  and he's broken down to either exact search or a feature search or even looking at symbol search for example you know mountain bikes versus mtb 21 inch tv versus 21" tvs right so it gives you the ability to look at real life of how you're actually shopping and have increases your conversions because we're looking at the intent.
rep, any questions on that.  so again what machine learning what i want to talk about the intent let me just go through this right we're looking
rep,at how they're actually shopping so for example if we look at nike black field boots the first thing is they're looking at black then we look at nike as the brand right and then boots as the actual you know product right.  so it gives you the actual intent and again brings out the most relevant searches when you create a navigation when we create a portion of more in this particular approach it increases your conversions because you're actually getting the most relevant products the right products that your customers are wanting to look for.
rep,and how do we how do we do this from a technology perspective it's if you look at it it really has three different areas four different areas i should say we already crawl the web to understand all the nuances of the niche the natural languages all the differences in the words colours etc all the shoppers intent. and then the other piece of it is looking at the algorithm to personalise based on your catalogue based on your shoppers behind behaviour and then all of that works together to continue to optimize the search experience that your customers have and how we put you in a learning as they're creating different synonyms or spelling words that may have been butchered.  our machine learning start learning that and automating that for you so you don't have to do that and
rep,what you may or may not have to do right now.
rep, one question um how are we doing on time um are we okay i mean are we okay for next 30 minutes or we have a hard stop
rep,in 10 minutes.
prospect, no we have to be somewhere for another meeting in about five minutes so it has to be cut short if you guys have more points to discuss.
rep, no problem i can send you this deck no problem let me let me go to what we want to talk about in terms of what the the cost is we talked about the merchandising piece i'll go through this we've talked about being able to direct based on specific categories.  we talked about the boosting in terms of our merchandising engine where you want to boost something high or low we can go into more detail in terms of this being able to pin products at this particular you know way whether it be seasonal or whatnot we can also look at slotting different products the shelving example. for example if you want to slot those to the top we can do so as well again we talked about the all the different algorithms and analysis charts that you
rep,can have in terms of looking at the top-line growth in terms of conversions and what's actually working versus what's not working and the zero related top related zero results right.  and again having this data so that you can optimize and merchandise your product according to how your customers are actually navigating but we talked about mobile a couple weeks ago in terms of having that as a different channel so we'll breeze by that because we've already talked about that as well so let me go into our performance in our slas.  we have a five-nine uptime here we have a ten percent increasing from the
rep,conversion guaranteed 300 milliseconds in terms of displaying the content remove the top top sources but what does this actually cost right.  so what we did took a look at is your site search visitors based on having the information that you sent over we said okay if their current site statistics is thirty-three thousand and ten thousand of those are through site search.  let's say typically your current conversion is about four percent usually it's about 3x and we said okay at a baseline of 12 percent and a guarantee increase in ten percent will not only increase the conversion to thirteen point two but
rep,will also increase your revenue on a yearly basis whether it be 10 percent 20% or 30% at four hundred and thirty two thousand dollars.
rep, but paying in terms of what you would pay unbxd is the 11 hundred dollars per month and i've already given you a discount so typically it's fifteen hundred but with q4 coming up i wanted to incentivize you at the $1100 fee.  so possibly something that we can get in for work you through i know i could do for i know that we talked about not having this implemented right now just because of the changes that that may or may not be happened with with your site with the holidays and whatnot but we can work through through that.
rep, and so this is really what i when it comes down to in terms of the annual annual revenue increase so what we're looking at in terms of a set up fee would be about three thousand dollars for a one-time setup fee to do the implementation we would increase your revenue anywhere from 144k  per year to that four hundred and 433k not millions and then again the one 1100 per month in terms of the subscription cost.
prospect, and then how does it work in terms of the contract.
rep, so the contract is typically a two year contract or one two three depending on on what you're looking at but what happens in the in the contract is you would set up a 90 day poc and within that poc we guarantee a 10 percent uptick if you do not see that a 10 percent uptick then you can get out of contract no questions asked otherwise it rolls into the annual subscription.
prospect, so there's no way we can do a month-to-month contract.
rep, typically we don't do a month-to-month contract but if you did do a month-to-month contract then the the per month charge would go up about 30% so we don't typically do that this is because we you want to see you want the you want the product to really work you want the product to be in for a period of time.  because after those 90 days you're gonna see the conversions go up dramatically and you're gonna see the increase in revenue go up but so you want to kind of keep that baseline and have that continued growth i mean only month-to-month.
rep, not sure what why would you want to go month-to-month just a curiosity.
prospect, we just like to have that option available it's just something that senior management preferred just as that we're not tied down to a contract especially if it's a year or two your contract.
rep, yeah and like i said you'll see the uptick i mean you're making the revenue increase right so it's not like you're not making money while you're using unbxd and again if you're not seeing that within the first 90 days which should give you a good indication of whether you should move forward or not forward with that.  so essentially you have a 90 day contract to get out at any time within the first 90 days and then have that rollover so i think within the first 90 days you'll you'll get an idea whether you want to move forward or
rep, hannah the reason we've structured this way is why we charge you a small amount 3000 for setting up a poc we actually spend two or three times that $10000 worth of software and services to tune on machine learning algorithm for your catalog so and it is that investment that you want to capitalize over a year rather than and that's the reason we offer a one-year contract after the poc is successful.
prospect, okay so how long how much time from our web developer would you guys need their collaboration.
rep, typically about a week.
prospect, a week so 40 hours.
rep, yeah typically but it could be lesser than that right just depending on we do a lot of the heavy lifting so any you know a large portion of the work is done by us as long as you kind of give us the data that we need we do majority of the work.
prospect, okay so the first 90 days first 90 days we go with you guys what is that going to look like step-by-step process what you may be doing in those first 90 days.
rep, yeah so what are the first 90 days what we'll do is we'll work with our customer success team to understand exactly what you guys are in terms of kpis right and then create that baseline and then understand what it is that we want to implement we want to do recommendations as well we want to increase we want to look at these different widgets.  but essentially what we'll do is you'll give us your catalogue we'll start indexing that so that the machine is our product to start learning all the nuances of your products and then over the course the next week to two weeks it will start optimizing. typically alan next slide captures what happens first 90 days.
rep, i am sorry i am sorry who's that.  <well you see second person within the pool one's coming back back back this one proposal oh the first island they're just a proposals like yes no you are one before that though>.  this one talks about the first 90 days the setup and the poc this is what happens first 90 days.
prospect, proposal structure that we're looking at.
prospect, okay so this is the first 90 days.
prospect, okay okay okay.
prospect, sent this already.
rep, that's correct.
prospect, so we might not be able to get around to this for a couple of weeks
rep, okay so it's it's just a curiosity if we got this to you if we followed up with their the first week of december would there be enough time to get if they decide to get their approval would there be enough time to get the contract approved so what i'm thinking is what if i send a contract that has these terms in there that way you can start reviewing them maybe with your illegal and if they do move forward with it that way we're where we can.
prospect, that's better for us.
rep, yeah that way we could take care of some administrative stuff well ahead of time.
prospect, okay so ideally the way it works with us is that's we're already in the queue for usually with a situation like this if you wanted to propose another investment for the website we probably have to wait till end of the year in sales if we see that end year sales are not really up to part up in the goal that we had set then that's something that we can use to leverage this proposal to our advantage.
rep, a lot of our customers are doing even if they do a even if they do a 5 person of the traffic right they want to take advantage of the higher traffic during the holidays and i'm not saying that that's something that you you would want to do but that's just kind of what we're seeing in terms of really kind of leveraging this to at its highest peak.
prospect, okay i see that <>.
rep, <> you don't have to go full throttle day one right you can start optimizing this is okay in december 15th or whatever we can do you know ten percent or five percent of the traffic is start throttling and tuning it up over the course of the 90 days and and from that way it's not fully blown you know all at once.
prospect, alright sounds good thank you guys.  very nice.
rep, okay thank you have a good day.
rep,primarily i work out of the sunnyvale office and i'll walk you through our solution but first of all let me thank you for giving us this opportunity to show you the solution and i'll show you how unbxd could help in innovation.
prospect, thank you.
rep, and jeff before we star just wanted to quickly understand a little more about your business why do customers buy from you and then where you are in your site search journey today and if there are any specific challenges that you're looking to solve then i can maybe focus more on those areas during the presentation.
prospect, okay i mean i i sell direct to the consumer my clients or customers could be individuals you know regular householders or they can be business there's companies that are ordering napkins with their logo or different printed products with their logo on it.  so i'm adding more and more products as time goes on and more categories are trying to lease more now so i think ultimately i think search could potentially be helpful in in helping them to target of the toys or the products.
rep, absolutely so have you heard of discount mugs do you compete with them.
prospect, they are big one i don't know if i really compete with them but i know that there are they seem to advertise a lot.
rep, okay because they are also evaluating us they have a homegrown search solution today which they are looking to <>.
prospect, they what they are in unbxd you said.
rep, they are evaluating us.
prospect, what they're using you.
rep, evaluating us they're not using us yet but they are evaluating us.
prospect, okay got it.
rep, we are trying to get on to implementation and do a poc for them.
rep, so curious what do you use for site search today is that in-house or.
prospect, it's nothing it's the built-in miva merchant search it's just the miva merchant search i mean search utility it's nothing it's it's as basic as you can get i mean it's a it's a third party technically which they acquired the company and it's very little.
rep, were you at <new york on> this year by any chance.  okay did you get a chance to stop by our booth we were at <new york on> as well.
prospect, yes.  i believe so yeah i stopped at every booth so probably stop there.
prospect, i stopped it all the search booths especially so.
rep, okay good sounds great okay so i prepared a deck for this call here is a quick agenda.
prospect, actually <> close off my phone system sorry.
prospect, okay good sorry.
rep, you can see my screen.
prospect, yes i can see.
rep, yep so on high-level wanted discuss four things with you today i wanted to talk a little about who we are to give you highlights on the elements of search that we resolve today. walk you through the current state of the union as we see it from our perspective on party innovations dot com and how we believe we can make a difference and lastly we can surely discuss any other details like pricing implementation process or any other questions that you might have.
prospect, it's not that easy to hear you i don't know if anything could be done about it i assume not but i think i would ask i don't know just hearing a little foggy but anyway.
rep, okay let me move to a silent room and then and let's see hope that's okay is it better.
prospect, it's okay yeah okay.
rep, okay so to give you a quick overview about who we are we are a five year old company with offices in sunnyvale chicago and india our core engineering team work out of here so we have the best in minds from silicon valley work for us.  we actually have people working for us from twitter microsoft yahoo search we have a customer success and sales team out of chicago we do have a backing team in india and some of the engineering work also happens there because they have a large presence in apac.  one of the largest search providers there and about 80 employees everybody
rep,is an engineer including me and we like to build and break things we have about 1200 plus customers globally 300 right here in the us and the reason we have grown faster than anybody else in this space is because of four unique differentiators.  one we have actually solved some of the site search problems and and i will show you what they are two we create custom solutions for all our retailers regardless of what size you are either you are an enterprise customer a small speciality site.  we have a custom built solution for everyone we have tremendous capability in terms of scale we can easily scale up or scale
rep, one of our largest customer newegg close to 100 million products 2 million products changing every two hours right because of the nature of the business
rep,out.
rep,they are a marketplace right the merchants come in come out products come in come out.
prospect, is that newegg dot com you said.
rep, newegg dot com yes.
prospect, you are right they were at the show yeah.
rep, yeah so scale is not at all a problem we have a technology to support that and lastly we are affordable and competitive in our price point for the kind of solution that we provide and because of these reasons we believe not just today but also in the future we would be the king of product discovery.  here are some of our uf i think something went wrong on this slide let me just show you a quick snapshot some of our customers i'm not sure.
prospect, is this javascripting or ajax or what it what is this.
rep, we have a couple of ways that we can implement the solution and i'll show you
prospect, have you worked with miva merchant.
rep,those.  yes absolutely we have a few customers on miva merchant and and we are integrating with few after miva come lot of customers actually we actually won a lot of customers at <new york on> as well.
prospect, okay yeah if you can show me that one eventually or someone you know that a big rig.
rep, sure i can do that so can you see the screen now i just opened up another.
prospect, i see a bright page.
rep, okay can you see it now the customer.
prospect, yeah yeah.
rep, so here are some of our customers from an enterprise space newegg ashley furniture i'm sure we must be aware of ashley furniture one of the largest in the us express clothing they are around 60000 products four hundred plus stores in the us bells florida they are based out of florida an apparel industry.  then some of the brands are our speciality sites i would say deborah lippmann a high-end cosmetic website she deborah actually herself sits with celebrities and comes up with these nail colors and lip colors and then sells them online.
rep, vac parts sells vacuum cleaner parts and then some of the other house hold electronic parts puravida bracelets only bracelets right.
rep, from a platform perspective our solution is platform agnostic either you are on viva magento shopify or even a homegrown e-commerce platform we have the ability to kind of integrate into any kind of commerce platform.  so that makes our solution as platform agnostic i moved to a different actually slide because i wasn't sure what went wrong so now to kind of you know what i wanted to do here was to walk you through the current state of party innovations from our perspective.  this is not to criticize anyone's work but how we feel you know one of the opportunities on
rep,your website where we can come in and make a difference so i hope that's okay for for us to walk you through this.  do you see my screen yep current slide.
rep, okay
rep,so the first thing i looked at was auto-suggest that's the first interaction that a customer makes on a website right start searching for something and it's highly important that we start guiding the customer from the very first interaction that they make on the website and that being the auto-suggest. see you do not have an auto-suggest feature yet neither so given it's not there a lot of websites out there have it but at times it's not visual it is  i not guided and i'll show you how you can have this feature with unbxd and not just have but make it also visual and guided and i will show you some of the live examples as well.
rep, then we looked at all the error tolerance on the websites i tried to misspell the words while searching for the products on the website.
prospect,know that'll not work i'm aware of that i know i don't have any of this sort.  no i
rep, yeah so i tried the spell check for hibbins and that shall even not work.  then i look for search all events see you have coasters tried square coasters the first one you see is around and here there is one more that's a round coaster then i try to search for a round coaster and you'll see round but then there are also square coaster than the volkswagen coaster actually missing here which was a wrong coaster. so this is <>.
prospect, i am looking the customer screen am i supposed to be.
rep, no let me just make sure <>.
prospect, alright i didn't see that.
rep, okay sorry for that so this is the auto-suggest that i looked at cup napkin ribbon no auto-suggests present there do you see the coasters spell check slide.
prospect, now i see yeah.
rep, okay so i tried coasters misspelled coasters with interchanging a and o didn't work then ribbons with a single b that did not work then i tried four square coasters you notice there is the first product itself is a round coaster and then there is a volks wagon round coaster here.  then i look for round coasters and you'll see there are square coasters the round one actually the volks wagon ones are missing here then i look for blue plates when i go to plates i saw some of the blue plates i think they were with the hp logo but it doesn't return any results not even plates for that matter.
prospect, right it gives nothing.
rep, yeah then i i became a little more specific right and it is important to solve such queries because the most specific the queries are the higher the intent of the customer provided right they are not here to kind of explore the site or do window shopping but they exactly know what they want right.
prospect, alright you just told me right now i know all this i have nothing i have no search i have the most useless search possible i'm very aware of that so i get that you don't even need to tell me that.
rep, cool i'll just not spend much time here and then take you straight away to our solution right so let me just skip these pens porcelain mugs beer koozles stemming tote versus totes totally different results but the intents are the same.  then i tried search results versus category pages bags i do get so this are your bags category page whereas in search bags totally returns different results so it was a high level understanding and then things that we feel we can come in and make a difference.  and how is is unbxd creating a difference right so that on
rep,high level three things technology business framework we have solved a lot of problems and we will show you what those are to create a foundation of scale.  business we understand your business and why customers buy from you so that we design a solution that will reflect that differentiator and thirdly the framework so you might be aware of all of these opportunities or problems that you need to overcome today but you might encounter a new problem a year from now.  you said you are adding more products right so let's say you you start a new category or a new brand or a new product how do you design
rep,or tune your site search to be most optimal from day one and this is something that's automatically taken care by unbxd.  let me show you some of our our live examples i'll just share the screen again give me a moment while i open the some of the live web sites actually here do you see parts warehouse website on the screen.
rep, okay so let me tell you a little about parts warehouse right before unbxd they used to have two
rep,different search boxes on their website the reason being they have two different kind of visitors on the website today one who knows exactly what part number to buy.  two people who know the model number of the of the appliance but not the part number and they had these two databases in data in two different databases altogether obviously we came in and we said you cannot have two different search boxes because now you are putting the onus on the customer. what if they select the wrong search box and also at the back end you're now doubling the problem right you need to solve two different or say optimize two different search boxes so instead of that what we design for them is something like this.
rep, the moment i start typing in this cell on the left left hand side you see all the parts for the cell and on the right hand side you see all the models for the cell and some of the top searches for the cell i'll show you another example.  us patriot tactical texas-based company they make around thirty five million dollars a year and they sell military apparel to citizens now here you'll notice the moment i start typing in nike or say ni right it it it shows one of the most popular brand being nike on the website. some of the popular categories within nike some of the popular products for nike and then some of the top queries not only that it also starts opening up
rep,some of the other brands which i would have probably not looked at starting with ni and some of their categories which might be popular and relevant right. here's another customer again not from your industry but i wanted to boast about the breadth of our solution right how we can solve challenges big basket dot come second largest grocery retailer in the apac they were in news couple of months ago for the two hundred million dollars funding now.  if if you and i look back at our grocery run jeff you'll notice that we end up buying the same ten fifteen twenty products right the same bread the same milk egg the every time we do our grocery run.
rep, they had similar kind of visitors and the challenge was people used to come on their website they used to buy 15 to 20 products in one transaction and for each such transaction it used to take 70 to 80 clicks for the customers to go search go to pdb page add to cart and then checkout right.  and for them we built something like this the moment i start typing in chicken you see all the chicken options available here ability to increase the quantity and add to cart right here from the search box not just that it opens up some of the commonly searched terms for c-h-i some other popular brands for chicken some of the categories.
rep, and we took it to the next level by adding personalization to it meaning if i was buying masala chicken more often on their website i would see masala chicken on top where while if you are buying say chicken with skin more often you would see chicken with skin on top in the auto-suggest selection.
rep,so you'll notice all three customers from a different industry the way they sell is different why customers buy from them is different right and we have designed a solution for all of the search being so intrinsic to a business right something that works for macy's might not work sears something that works for target might not work for you right.  and that's where we come in with our customization and make sure that we try and replicate the experience why customers buy from you right here from the auto-suggest box this was the business piece the business the major business side of it i want to quickly run you through the the technology piece as well.
rep, do you see my screen 12 query types.
rep, okay great so before the founders actually started building the technology at unbxd they spent quite some time actually more than a year doing two things one thing they they crawled the web for various different large e-commerce catalogs to see what was being sold online.  two they look they did some research in terms of how people were searching on the web be it on on say google or be it on an e-commerce site like amazon right how people are searching and we classified the search queries into 12 different types right.
rep, to give you an example say exact query if i know the exact part number exact sku number and i'm searching for that a feature search could be say a red dress wherein dress is the product red is the feature of the of the product dress a thematic search say a night dress or a party dress where party or night are the theme while dress is the product.  linguistic shortcut right a 10 inch blades instead of i n ch i'm putting double quotes there and then trying to write 10 inch plates right and that becomes a linguistic shortcut natural language plates for my birthday or plates plates for my son's birthday that's a natural language query.
rep, and people are searching this way on google today on the search engines and they expect the e-commerce search tools also to understand the same language that they talk to on a search engine right and and it's important that the search tool or the search bar on e-commerce website also starts reacting exactly the same way giving them the same experience.  so the next thing that we did was now started putting in the the spell check we built an algorithm for an automated spellcheck right you do not have to go and create libraries you do not have to go and create synonyms for any spell checks.
rep, we automatically correct 85 to 90% of the words misspelled on your website the remaining 10 15 percent that we are not able to are the words which are so butchered that it's really difficult for any automated system to really auto correct or understand.  the algorithm that we have has the capability of auto correcting up to six words in one single search query of a two alphabets misspelled in each word right here you'll notice black leather jacket all three are misspelled we have the ability to auto correct it and not just auto correct but immediately start showing results for the most probable option of this auto correct.
rep, any questions here so far.
prospect, no no i'ii when you are a quick question for you when when you're doing searches on the website you know it's miva merchant so the products already have an image an image search image affiliated with it is your your search utility have the ability to overwrite the image that miva shows or no.  let's say i have for instance on my website let's say when you do a search for a 16 oz stadium cup it's a red cup that shows you know that's the image i have set up but if customers are putting in like looking for black cups am i able to have an alternative image that's set up through your search utility or not.
rep, yes do you see my screen.
rep, yeah so we have a technology so here you are noticing something without unbxd someone's looking for a red dress all dresses are available in red but the images are the default images that are being set by the system.  whereas we have a technology built in that can immediately go and identify the red dress image and start showing the red dress image.
prospect, i see okay.
rep, the only thing we would need is to ensure that the red dress image is indexed in your catalogue so as far as the image is indexed we have the image available we can pull up the right variant be it the colour be it the size <>.
prospect, is it indexed in your shopping is it indexed from the shopping cart or is it indexed in the search utility.
rep, in the search.
prospect, in the search shop okay.
rep, and we take your catalogue and then we start indexing that at our end so in your catalogue the the images should be available there should be an image for black cup red cup white cup whatever the colour variants are and we then have the technology to pull up the right image and show  up.
prospect, right and i can use it over time as i learn where people searching for i can create.
rep, yes you can also start creating new images yes especially so i'll also show you our reporting you will get a lot of insight from reporting in terms of what people are searching on your website right based on which then you can tune your system and start merchandising.  so i'll walk through that as well.  right well we are on this colour thing there's
rep,another thing that we have added on top of it so not just you know showing the red dress but say if i was to come onto your website and look for a crimson cup right. people can get really particular about the colour the them of colour i'd a crimson theme of the party and i need a crimson cup obviously if you don't have a crimson cup in your in your catalogue we have a technology to understand that crimson is closer to red that is from the red colour family and say ruby red garnet cherry cherry are the close of colours to crimson.  so we immediately go and find other red coloured products and start showing them and not the blacks and blues basically.
prospect,okay and when you do a search with your website is the urls different what is the url like of it is that something on the server or.
rep, we have two we have actually three different ways to do it one the one that you're talking about the different url is a hosted approach and i'll walk you through that then we have an image ajax approach wherein the url doesn't change you own the url it's your url which just put a div tag and start inserting html into it and the third one is an obvious back end api.
prospect, well i guess the least expensive for <>.
rep, pardon.
prospect, the least expensive i probably look for the least expensive.
rep, so i would say that with hosted versus in page ajax the the expense really doesn't change much it will pretty much remember same except the api based which is a little more expensive and not very expensive i would say.  the difference would be hardly forty to fifty percent in terms of the implementation or the set of api but with hosted and in page ajax both will remain same we would still recommend an in page ajax way of integrations so that you have the control you own the url it does not impact your seo and other marketing credibility basically right.
rep, so that's that's what we recommend for all our customers and also for miva we have a plug-in in place to pull out all the data that you send to viva we straight away immediately pull that out from miva in real time so we do have plug-in for miva.
rep, yeah so i showed you the spell check automatic stemming similarly say any singular plural dres dresses game gaming center central we take care of this out of the box immediately you do not have to again do anything at the backend this is something that system is able to do automatically.
rep, but at the same time we also give you the the ability to create synonyms and this is primarily for any industry jargons so say let me give you an example one of our customer who sells to weightlifting world in weightlifting world the shoes are called lifters.  now there's no way we would know shoes are called lifters second if we even if we were to add that into our universal corpus lifters might mean totally something else in a different industry so in that case what we do is we give you an ability to create these synonyms this can be unidirectional bi-directional or replacement synonyms through our back end.
rep, and i will also show you how you can do that without the help of it any any questions.
prospect, no i get it.
rep, okay great automated redirects i assume you might be doing this from from the back end today for search queries to be being redirected to your category pages.
prospect, so how does this automatic redirect so in other words they put in sneakers so what's the automatic redirect what are the redirecting.
rep, so so we feel that whenever someone is looking for a product right that you have a category for so in your case say i was is looking for bags and you already have a category for that choice and these category pages are the most curated pages right.  the well curated pages they are the best set of results so whenever someone is looking for similar products the best place to take them is to your category pages in this case say if i was searching sneakers and you already have a category page for sneakers the best place to take me is to sneakers right in the category page.
rep, be it sneakers plural or a sneaker something that works out of the box you do not have to do anything at the back end but say if you were to now say someone looking for sandals force them to the sneakers category page you can also do that and you can configure that from our back end.
rep, head query search say i was looking for mobile in this example right the intent is yet not clear whether the person was looking for a mobile phone head phone cases we have technology that identifies the right subcategories for the given search query and start showing them in the order of importance or popularity right.  so mobile's being the most popular that's the first category then headphones then cases and then headsets but not only that we start immediately showing results for the most popular or the most important category and that here being mobile we also start showing the results from mobile.
rep, here is another example we
rep,built it as a demo for a customer outnet if i look for say alexander wang who's a designer sells a lot of different products totes shoulder bags or say dresses shoes you see all products right by alexander wang neatly bucketed into each category giving me the abilities to browse through these horizontally or vertically say for a particular category or for a particular product.
rep, dynamic filters so this is a big differentiator that we bring onto the table i notice i think you do not have filters on your website today but so say if you have filters and you have say specific filters in this case for shoes obviously the shoe filters are going to be something like ankle height width or they are specific to shoes.  now irrespective of however i search on the website say casual shoes formal shoes shoes as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category and here them being shoes the shoes filters would automatically kick in now if i was searching for shirts say however i should search for shirts men shirts casual shirts formal shirts the shirts filters would automatically kick in.
prospect, okay that's interesting.
rep, so i showed you the variance i showed you the colour synonyms zero result page so we always say that we are always going to have zero results page right this is something that we cannot avoid given you are probably not carrying a product or say you're not carrying a brand or the the search queries have junk values in it.  we believe the onus is on us to start guiding the customer whenever they encounter a zero result page and we do that by putting up two different widgets and these are real time widgets personalized for each customer right.
rep, one gives them the ability to go back into their product discovery journey continue seeing what they were already looking on your website these are the recently viewed products now based on their affinity towards a brand particular colour design pattern style category in real time.  we start recommending products which is highly personalized for that user meaning they are more probable to buy these products and we start recommending these products also here so they can now click on one of these and then continue to browse through your website.  another
rep,alternative say i like this shoes and there could be hundred reasons why i like this it could be the colour the design the pattern and the brand the style right we give customers an ability to immediately evaluate more similar products.  you see a button here you can call it anything you want here we say see similar products someone clicks on it a small modal window opens up with similar products for evaluation the customer can click on any of these if they like if they don't they can close this window and go back onto their search results page.
rep, alternative for mobile site so do you have a mobile site today.
rep, okay so if in case
rep,in future you plan to launch a mobile site all of this works out of the box even on a mobile site hear a few alternatives for mobile to quickly evaluate more similar products.  say an auto suggest option for mobile scope suggestions recent searches then category refinement on mobile say shoes and then men women boys they can refine into category to limit the kind of number of products that they can see on a smaller screen.
rep, and then multi-select filters the ability to select multiple filters on a mobile screen as well.
rep, so what what i walked you through so far are three things right one auto suggest second i showed you the technology piece which is the relevance stemming color variants synonymous right and thirdly the filters and the dynamicness of these filters for both mobile and desktop.  there are two more things i want to walk you through and so i think you asked me some of the miva customers right i know that.
prospect, can you give me 30 seconds not more than 30 seconds.
prospect, i got do something really good took me 30 seconds thanks. alright sorry about that.
rep, so can you see my screen cables dot com.
prospect, oh yeah yeah.
rep, yes so they are on miva today then we have fashionable games who is on miva if i'm not wrong we are also currently integrating with schoolsin dot com they are also on the miva and a few more websites that that we started on miva after miva come.
prospect, can i see how this works can you show me something a search this is.
rep, this is how they wanted it canes right and that's how it has been design for them.
prospect, okay can i see the back end or anything on these do you have a your interface i want to see what i've to work with.
rep, yes so do you see my screen now.
rep, okay this is the damp demo dashboard and this is the demo site that he built it for okay so once we have the system set up right meaning we are solving 90% of your product discovery challenge we taking the search to 90 percent the rest 10 percent control is something that we want to give to you.  because you know your business best right how you want to merchandise the products how you would want to merchandise some of your popular queries and categories that's the control that we give you and i'll show you how and where you can do that through our dashboard but here is a quick overview of the dashboard.
rep, once we have the feed uploaded we will have the complete details in terms of how many products you have what's the feed size like you can also manage multiple sites if you have multiple sites multiple domain.
prospect, not just one site right.
rep, yeah even a staging versus live site right is something that you can manage from a single login dashboard here are the fields these are your product catalogue fields we tune this up make them searchable non searchable based on your inputs.  but you will have complete visibility into that yeah this is where you can set filters for your website these are the global filters you can quickly add facets select an option how you want it right meaning the product catalog attribute and name the filter and clear the filter as well.
rep, then the synonyms again to reiterate the synonyms are for only say industry jargons you do not have to create these for spell checks or synonymous words okay and that is something that that's taken care of out of the box let's say lifters is equal to shoes right click create synonym done this will work right.
prospect, so i have have to add them or you do i have to manually add the synonyms or they're there is that what you're saying.
rep, you could add them so any specifically or industry you could add them or you can have us give us the list and we can also add them for you so that's absolutely doable.  but this is pretty simple right even if you or any of your merchants have to go and add these
rep,synonyms it's pretty simple and this is not for all words you'll hardly see like very specific eight ten synonyms for your industry that you might want to configure here that's it.  then let me show you how you can merchandise a particular query i should say let me just delete some of things now here you can set any global rules any global query rule so say you don't want to show products which are out of inventory and you want to demote products which are out of inventory.  any rules that is applicable to to all your search queries you can set those here now for a particular query say a dress
rep,and let me just show you on the website what it looks like when i type in dress right this is the live website this is what you see as dress and you see this is the replica of the live website on our dashboard right.  the same products in the same order even on the dashboard it's exactly the same as on your website this is all obviously relevant right you are not seeing shoes or shirts for the query dress right but now you can go in merchandising meaning you can either say filter results based on any of your product catalogue attributes or say run promotions boost.  to give you an example say you want to boost a particular brand
rep,boost contains eliza so you now see all eliza products are on top even in that say you want this white dress always on top because this is your high inventory product you always want to have this one.
prospect, are you mean drag and drop.
rep, you can drag and drop and then pin product in particular position and it's as it's that simple and then this is still more of a product level pinning now say if i was to do a very high level pinning meaning in position 5 & 6 i want dresses by say ralph.  now the 5th and 6th position will always have the ralph lauren dresses even if this dress by ralph lauren goes out of inventory this will be replaced by another ralph and and on the live website you will notice that these changes occur in real time right.
prospect,can you show me maybe you did show me a moderate case can you show me let's say somebody puts in black dress can you do that.
rep, so i'm not sure if this this thing would work.
prospect, that's ok that's fine ok let's say that second row the second row the third one in on the second row that one that's not that one it's not black let's say i wanted to replace that with black is there an easy way to do that in the back end.
rep, yes so say black dress create rule merchandise you see this right this is exactly the same as the website.
rep, now you have the black dress and you don't want this one here that you want to drag and drop this here.
prospect, can you replace the image can you replace the image.
rep, the image this image.
rep, for the same dress you need the black image is that what you are talking about.
rep, yeah so if we have that in the catalogue then we will so if if we had a black image of this dress right this will automatically be taken care of.
prospect, the way i add the black dress where would i do that i guess it's some sort of.
rep, that would be in your product catalogue feeds.
prospect, would it be on your site or will it be on miva merchant.
rep, on miva merchant.
prospect, i'd have to do it on miva merchant.
rep, yes and and and i can you know maybe i might not be correct with that but jeff what i can do is i can get a technical guy on the call and he can who can exactly tell you how to do that with miva.
rep, he can tell you exactly but i can tell you it will not be complicated it will be pretty simple.
prospect, because i'm afraid that i've to create another product.
rep, i get that i agree with that you don't have to with us you don't have to you don't have to create another product i know traditionally that's how people do they create other products for colour variance right but with us you don't have to do that if you have ten colour variants you can have one product and then you can have ten different images for them we can take care of that.
prospect, you can't drag and drop images from another folder onto your system correct like.
rep, no you cannot drag and drop the images.
rep, yeah and specifically that question i can you know on our follow-up discussion i can put that as on or i can get a technical guy on the call and can give you an exact clear explanation on that.
rep, so that was merchandising slotting you can also ad banners for these search query page here by say inserting an image url landing page url or an html code now let me show you how you can create landing pages for your marketing campaign.  so say here if i was to do clearance 2016 on the live site you see actually no products for clearance 2016 right because there's nothing.
prospect, you can create a page and then use and image right.
rep, yeah we can clearance 2016 create rule quickly merchandise obviously will not show you anything because there is nothing that's present so i click on convert landing page convert to landing page.  now this opens up your complete catalogue for you to create landing pages you can similarly now filter boost slot and then add banners if you want so here this is what it is immediately if i was to do this here is 2016 you'll see the same results right.  and you will get a clear url that you can use for your
rep,seo campaigns marketing campaigns any email marketing campaigns that you run and similarly you can add banners as well here.  so this was on the search queries
rep,similarly you can also say do your category pages you can merchandise the category pages say for category men you can start adding any banners that you want and you can also now manage filters here.  so say for men i want the price filter to be on top i can drag and drop the price filter on top i want to hide the colour facet i can go and say hide it i want to show the category filter i can just go and click on it and and start showing the filters and i can change the order the way i want it to be.  now however people search for as far as 75% or more results are from the men category these filters will
rep,automatically kick in for search result pages.
rep, now let me walk you through the reports so what do you use for your reporting today is that google analytics or any other third-party tool.
prospect, miva merchant has it but i use google analytics.
rep, okay so i'll tell you a drawback with google analytics or any similar system it's right so i was to come onto your website start searching something didn't find it then i start navigating through your website and eventually buy it but when you go back to your google analytics it will tell you that this was a search conversion.  the reason because it started as a search but in reality it was not a search conversion because customer could not find anything through search right and it was actually a navigation conversion so those are the kind of challenges that we overcome with our reporting.
rep, here you see some of the high level overview in terms of what are your top search queries top products added to cart your top zero result where is your top click products so top zero results queries you are seeing a trend christmas query zero result page 810 hits you immediately create a landing page or you create a start merchandising this particular query on your website.  make sure that the customers were typing in christmas are now starting to see some results rather than looking at a zero results page right so that's the kind of usability of these reports then we take it to the next level by providing query level reporting.
rep, so these are each and every individual query search query on your website how the hits have been whatever your product views conversions orders and other details now if i was to click on dresses i can also see the a trendline in terms of the performance of the query over a period of time.  i can i can change the duration by by going here i can look at say last six months data 12 months data to see how the performance of this query has been and what are the products associated with this query that are performing not performing similarly the flip side product level query how each product is is performing.
rep, then i click on products gives me what kind of queries the products show up for and what kind of conversions this particular product has for each so that's the detailed reporting that we provide this is also available for export into csv or in excel to be shared within the organization.  so i showed you the five things that that i wanted to today which was auto suggest then the technology piece with stemming synonym relevancy then the filters and the dynamic ness of these filters merchandising dashboard how you can merchandise create synonyms from the back end or merchandising a particular query and create landing pages and the reporting.
rep, now i know that you had a question in terms of how we integrate right i will show you the ways of integration so here if you see rods dot com do you see the url.
rep, rods dot com right now the moment i type in say jeans hit enter you see the url changed right or this is something that's hosted by us we usually don't recommend that for you we typically want you to look at an in page ajax but i want to show that we have the capability even do this this complete url is owned by us this page is owned by us and rendered by us.  now us patriot tactical you see the url uspatriottactical dot com i type in nike search url doesn't change right this is the in page ajax way of implementing but what what us patriot tactical is doing is rendering the header and the footer on the website gives us an empty div tag and we start rendering the search results here.
rep, makes sense.  and the third and the obvious way is the backend api way of integration but most customers start a poc with us on in page ajax and only the enterprises then
rep,move to an api based integration because that's how they wanted right they want a little more control on to the system.
prospect, which they start of.
rep, in page ajax.
prospect, and that's why which one is that that was the first one that was the one.
rep, this one this one.
prospect, this is ajax and what is the more robust.
rep, this is more robust yeah and then third one is api but then that involves a lot more <>.
prospect, ajax probably is the best.
rep, yeah this is the best way to implement it.
prospect, then i can make i can set it up so it only shows up on search pages i don't have to have it it's about you do you you want product pages or only on search pages.
rep, no only on search pages.  search pages okay.  so that's from the solution perspective let me just make sure i covered everything any any questions you have jeff.
prospect, yeah what is the price.
rep, sure so i our pricing is dependent on two things one is your product catalogue size and the other one is your monthly visits or sessions.
rep, so can you give me an estimate for both what your product catalogue size is like today.
prospect, i mean it's not that many products it's maybe like i don't know let me see i don't think it's not many products.
rep, so would you have an estimate may be say less than a thousand more than a thousand two thousand.
prospect, well i have about six hundred products and it's uh a hundred hundred thousand visitors a year so maybe you know like ten thousand or so a month.
rep,so ten thousand are like total visits are they like unique visits that you have.
prospect, i think it let me see what let me see what google says somebody called me and asked me this this morning.
rep, okay i think abhishek would have done that.
prospect, it says in the last month i've had twelve thousand session twelve thousand three hundred sessions.
rep,twelve thousand three hundred sessions so we are looking at around say fifteen thousand sessions our pricing is based on sessions total sessions.
prospect, yeah so i mean in the past year i've had around 100 thousand sessions.
rep, okay so but given say you might want to grow this year we can we can look at an approximate or fifteen thousand sessions and our pricing wouldn't change much from ten to fifteen thousand even if we if i was to take it up to twenty thousand sessions and the pricing wouldn't change much.  that would remain same because the reason being what what i am looking at from a pricing perspective is to put you on to our basic pricing plan this are our like a starter pricing for search which is a thousand dollars a month as in that's the monthly recurring fee.
rep, and over and above that we have a one-time setup fee which which would be around in the range of two thousand to three thousand dollars one-time setup.
prospect, it's just two or three thousand setup and then around a thousand dollars minimum per month.
rep, yes and the way we do the on boarding of a customer is we do of 50 percent poc meaning you pay us so this is how the deal is you pay us 50 percent for the implementation right we kick start the implementation we take the site live.  you test us out for sixty days and for those sixty days you pay us only 50 percent of the monthly fee so you pay us 50 percent of the implementation field 50 percent for the first two months monthly fees during the phase of testing us out post sixty days if you like the solution and if you decide to continue with unbxd you pay the remaining 50% and continue on the actual monthly recurring fee.
rep, if you for any reason you don't like the solution maybe the weather is not good there right and you don't like you don't want to use unbxd you can just walk out of the contract with no more obligations no more money due to unbxd.  we will we are okay if we are not able to satisfy you not show you the uplift we are okay with just a 50% payment on during the poc.
rep, and this is how we on board even a small customer or a large enterprise the reason being we want you to see the value don't think that this is this is a very pricey solution but but make sure then the solution is paying for itself right in 60 days you should be seeing enough increase in conversions enough increase in revenue for you to justify that cost and then make a decision.
prospect, got you okay.
rep, jeff does that sound reasonable is it more.
prospect, i think it is reasonable for what it is but it's still a lot of money but not denying you that everybody seems to be i'm meeting with a couple of other companies and then i'm you know once i see everybody i could decide what to do but no for me it's a big investment because i'm just a little guy and spending $1000 on a month for this is a unusual investment for me so i have to be i have to think about it.
rep, is there a better number that you might be comfortable with.
prospect, i don't know i mean everybody says the same thing i said they started off at a thousand that and uh with the helical not sli uh the other one not foi son spender but is that so search spring yeah search spring search spring went up 750 a meeting with a company tomorrow there might be less money i think it's next.
rep, they'll give it to you they might offer you at 250 dollars i can tell you that but they don't have a strong solution.
prospect, yeah sure yeah.
rep, so jeff you i would i would surely want you to see that product but on a high level we don't compete with next opr or search spring with sli we do at times in the in a mid segment on the enterprise side we typically complete with endeca and solr. those are the two solutions that we integrate with with search spring we have had 20 so spring customers convert to unbxd in last one quarter one of the customer is into integration right now it's called sf cables their old website is yet on search screen you can look at their website they are a 12 year old search screen customer and then they have recently signed up with us and then and want to move ahead with unbxd because they they realize the value right.  again
rep,given the competition pricing is not something that's important we are looking for an opportunity for work new logos right add new logos deliver our value we just raised our series b funding two months ago and and we are here you know hungry for customers hungry for business so i would want to do business with you right we would want to have you as an unbxd customer.
rep, if there is anything that you want me to look at right with regards to pricing i would be more than happy to work on that obviously we i will not be able to match up next opr pricing.  but between search spring and sli if there is something between that price point right i can i can surely work on it given we are ready to close this immediately and then get onto the integration piece quickly we can surely work on the pricing pricing is set apart because we know that that once we start delivering value you will be more than happy to pay us.
prospect, perfect thank you very much.
rep, is that convermax.
prospect, what was that yeah yeah.
rep, you might not want to spend time with them they're very very small i would recommend you see next opr product so you know exactly what you're paying for with unbxd i would not recommend you to go ahead of his next opr ever but at least from a comparison perspective you would know what you're getting for 250 dollars versus for 500 dollars versus thousand dollars right what is that it that you are spending for.
prospect, got it why next opr you don't like.
rep, they're they don't have a strong product at all.
prospect, got it alright i've to see.
rep, you might out of the three if you were to compare unbxd with someone i think sli would be a little fairer comparison and next opr and search spring are surely not a comparison to what we have built.
prospect, not a robust.
rep, not at all as robust even with the auto suggest right it's all templated approach what they so what i showed you the the auto suggests here right everywhere you see the customization for each customer right based on how they are selling with next opr and search spring you will get a very templated approach.  the four search queries and the four products takes pattern match it's not guiding it's just trying to you know match the text basically so if i'm typing in bags it will pick up all your products see where the bags is and then show those right.  say if there is a bag
rep,full of balloons it will also show that product in bags because it's trying to find bags and not contextual aware right it's not able to understand that someone is actually looking for bags and not a bag full of balloons right.
rep, so that's the difference that's the robustness of the other solution and again with pricing i'm absolutely okay to reduce the pricing or alternatively if you're interested in looking at a product recommendation we do have that as a product i can go ahead and include that for the same price right.
rep, which itself is a similar price we have a 10 widget approach for product recommendation like recently viewed products your top sellers on the website on each category pages what our top seller products those kind of widgets i can maybe show you some examples you got two minutes and i can maybe show you that.
prospect, yeah go ahead.
rep, let me show you the product recommendation piece this for you so here are the ten widgets you see my screen.
prospect, yep.
rep, so here are the ten widgets as we provide recommended for you more like these brand top sellers complimentary products category top sellers recently viewed viewed also viewed right so these are the some of the examples so say someone looking at a on your homepage for say it if i was to come onto your homepage.  based on real-time data what what products are popular what's the seasonality what is the location of the user we start recommending products even on the homepage you must have seen this on amazon amazon made this famous in late nineties actually and and we have built a competitive product for that.
rep, then here you will notice again some of the other examples for popular items on this website here are alternative products i'm looking at this particular bracelet based on my affinity towards a brand was a price point towards the color it was the pattern we again start recommending some of the products which might be similar.  and then say complimentary products we notice that say five out of ten people who bought humidifiers also bought cartridges right so we start cross selling products by showing some of the products here then we have up-selling and cross-selling for cart pages.
rep, five out of ten people buying nail colours also bought lip colours so start up selling lip colours here and again some of the similar products in cart this is something i show you with search zero so page similar products on mobile then i pdb page recommendations.  and something that became very famous with apparel industry actually might a look right someone buying this say a short you know we now start saying okay here is a button for my the look and then we immediately start showing jacket shoes t-shirts and that may go well with the short and giving them the ability to kind of you know upsell other products right.
rep, and all of this is based on the popularity of the products based on content what people are searching clicking and what is the content available on your on your product catalogue then wisdom of crowd what people are clicking on from a particular location based on the festivities seasonality.  someone coming in from say in new york you might want to show them heavy jacket or a warmer jacket versus someone coming from san francisco you might want to show them a lighter jacket right so that kind of intelligence.  and
rep,then obviously personalized in terms of that individual behaviour their implicit behaviour on your website what products they have been looking at we start making all of these recommendations.
prospect, perfect thank you very much appreciate talking.
rep, if you are subscribing for the recommendation tool that we can also add that onto the search pricing or i can we can look at some sort of discount given you have made up your mind you think unbxd is the right solution we can surely look at this.
prospect, thank you so much.
prospect, i appreciate thanks so much have great time.
rep, thank you.
rep,the sunny wale san francisco area there are 15 walk you through our solution with examples and before i get start just wanted a quickly and understand a bit more about the uniques or why customers buy from you and anything specifically you want to know so that i can focus on those areas.
prospect,okay so we're in a primarily an online retailer we have a physical store but this is more like a statement where we do sort of showcase our products currently we have only one physical store here in copenhagen but we have existed online since yeah say early 2001 this will the journey where we started so we've been in the game for quite a while and slowly growing um we football specialty so our customers are primarily football players because like the most of the products we sell and by football i mean soccer in case you know so primarily young kids who actually play football so this is like football equipment and you know training gear we also have a lot of collectors people who like you know collect a limited edition kind of things if you know any people who like sneakers you also there there are a huge group of people who will just collect limited edition football boots. and we're quite lucky to be one of the few retailers who actually get to sell some of these products that's like the main driving point but overall our website is like more content driven we try to do things not like a traditional retailer website you would see like you could see like like we try to tell stories about about the products and we educate the users about okay this kind
rep,absolutely i did spend some time on your website and surely the kind of products that you carry are unique there was surely a lot of you know categories on your website which caught my interest so and looks like if you've been selling online for for a long time now since early 2000-2001 so you have kind of grown with the own e-commerce industry. awesome sounds good so i've actually prepared a deck for you and then just to give you an idea here is the agenda i hope you can see my screen.
prospect,yeah. yeah.
rep,okay great so the agenda i might look long but in-short i'm today going to our four points on a very high level a) i wanted to talk a little about who we are b) give you highlights on the elements of search that we resolve today c) walk you through the current state of the union as we see it from our perspective on your site and lastly we can discuss other details like pricing implementation process or any other questions that you might have for us today make that sense.
prospect,it works okay just so you know i am the cto of the company so i'm very much into the technical aspect of it on how we can resolve the problem this is like my primary interest in so like how you guys could we could work together in solving the problems that we might face in the future.
rep,it really sounds good i have also have a leave of mine on the call his name is sharat so he would be the best person to answer any technical questions you just wanted to let you know that any point in time which i cannot answer the question i think a sharath could help you and then answer for you for that.
prospect,sharath how are you?.
rep,good how are you?. we have an army with us right now so a lot of people logged in so any question you ask we're more than happy to answer you. okay great so here is a quick snapshot about us fasal we are a five years old company with offices in sunnyvale chicago and india our core engineering team works out of here so we have the best in minds from silicon valley work for us we have people from twitter a yahoo search microsoft we have a customer service customer success and sales team working out of chicago and we do have a back-end team in india and some of the engineering work also happens there because we have a large presence the apac region we are actually one of the largest search providers in apac at about 80 member team everybody is an engineer and we surely like to build and break things we have about 1200 customers globally 300 right here in the us and the reason we are we have grown faster than anybody else in the space is because of four unique differentiator one we have actually solved some of the site search problems that will not solve before and i'll show you how two we create custom solutions for all our retailers regardless of what size you are whether you are an enterprise customer or a small speciality site like yours three we have tremendous capability in terms of scale we can easily scale up or scale out depending on what your needs are and four we are very affordable and competitive in our price point and
rep,because of these reasons we do not just today but also in the future we would be the king of product discovery.
rep,here are some customer of customers of ours i'm surely you must be aware of target all the international sites are so biased a newegg second largest retailer in the us ashkey one of the largest furniture store in the us then express they carry more than 60000 products 400 stores bealls books based out of florida and a parallel site then we also work with speciality sites and brands like debora lipman a prestige cosmetics brand based out of new york vac parts shindigs a puravida shylvane
rep,just just wanted to quickly ask what platform is a website on today.
prospect,um we develop it ourself.
rep,home ground.
prospect,yes yes it's based on python it's basically just a connection of many many micro services including site search as a services i mean separately.
rep,okay cool sounds good so we work with all kinds of platforms essentially making our solution platform agnostic either it be one of these standard platforms like magento prestashop shopify or a homeground custom platform yours and it's a very very highly customizable platform but still keeping the implementation under four weeks unlike any of our competitors variant could last anywhere from 90 to 120 days any any questions so far.
prospect,oh no interesting.
rep,okay sounds good so before we get started today what i wanted to do was a quick site review and get a sense on how search works on your site today this is not to criticize you okay i know you're the cto and you probably head this but i i do not want to criticize this and and and just it's just for me to get a background on what works on your site and where unbxd can come in and make a difference and if.
prospect,i mean i'm not well aware that you know how search could be a lot better and so yeah that's why basically i should be call up you philip both it should be kind of interesting .
rep,that's that's that's good to hear and i'm sure we can show you how we can improve this.
rep,great so i'll quickly run you through this and then feel free to stop me on any of the slides so the first thing that we actually look on an look on any site is the autocomplete or the autosuggest and and the reason being this is the first interaction of visitors on your site makes with you in terms of looking for the right products right one thing that you are doing good on on the site is surely the the visual i've come across a lot of sites would do not have visuals on autosuggest. so you have that taken care of but with regards to the results if we notice that there are just four results for any queries that that we type in and and most of the times these results are probably not even relevant so i was looking for boots here and you would see all results were t-shirts. then next i tried shoes got the same for t-shirts and then i tried to look for something from adidas good you are showing me to adidas products not sure if they are really very popular products on your website but those are the only two that came up the others were from puma and uhs sport. then what what we looked at was the error tolerance or the spellcheck on the website you and i both would agree that today the visitors intend to make mistakes right.
rep,when they're trying to search on the website so i tried a couple of permutation combinations and tried goalkeeper gloves by missing out an e which displayed no products same thing that i saw you had some product called nike pro tiger black and then i try to do that by removing i think one of the gs and it did not give me any results then i try to interchange e and k in nike i know it's stupid but the whole idea was to see if actually we get any you know if it automatically corrects the query understands the query and shows the right products it this where did return some products but the very first product the red t-shirt that you see there is actually from adidas not nike and this were these results were surely shown are under any random logic is what i assumed. then important so this is auto suggest and and the error tolerance. then the most important thing is the search relevance how relevant are the search results for any query on you on your site and i know that you carry a lot of t-shirts and i'm sure that a lot of your revenue must be contributed from from t-shirts and the shoe sales so i try to keep my queries around that and see how they work tried tees the very first product was a shoe second one i tried adidas tees before then i got four shoes and no t-shirts at all tried nike football so i saw that you so i i do have a small screen shot here on the right-hand side of the screen well footballs and it was really surprising for me to see so many brands of footballs right. and i try to do nike footballs i got the shoes then i look for puma red shoes it gave me no results though i know that not just this puma red shoes but you have quite a few more puma red shoes out there i had never heard about black socks tape and i'm not one of those athlete kind of people i didn't know that you could have tapes for socks and when i saw that i i tried to search that using a search bar what i got was black socks and no tape then yeah this this was a nice section you have i think five players listed out there and products
rep,associated with them so i tried lionel messi and no products this was again a very nice product for for the bathing's right this is cool the products are cool but this search was not very impressive then tried and nb for new balance shoes and then tried a natural language query say something like boots under 100 e-commerce industry or any e-commerce website the category pages are the most curated and i'm sure that should be the case with you in unisport as well.
prospect,yes absolutely that right.
rep,so when i try to search exactly like your what you have in your categories and in this case you have a category nike football boots i get 451 products when i go to the category well when i go to search the results returned are 257 and also you see the order of the results and are different. same thing i tried with nike shin pads 15 products versus 47 products and then stemming so this is you know we come across a lot of stem words on on websites today you call t - shirts t - shirts while the someone searching on a web site now just come in look for t-shirts without the hyphen and you see difference in terms of the number of results and what results are being short 2340 shirts without the hyphen and with the hyphen 477 got ups. so i'm sure you must be aware of all of these and and i will on the on your website but now quickly show you in terms of how we solve these problems are are these challenges for
rep,other customers of ours. so what is the difference that bring that we bring to the table right and then we have flipped that into three parts technology scale from with regards to business we understand your business and why customers buy from you that we design in a solution that will reflect the deferentiator each and every customer of ours has has a customized solution a part of our solution is customized for them and because having a strong strong foundational framework for any site  search of solution is much important you might be aware of the opportunities or problems that you are that you need to solve today but you might encounter a new problem i hear from now in that particular instance how do you go about solving that problem let's say for example you've start a new carry so how do you design or tune your site search to be most optimal from day one right. and unbxd this is automatically taking cares. so rather than showing you more snapshots let me let me just quickly show you some live examples of our customers just a moment let me
rep,just open can you see my site screen.
prospect,oh no.
rep,you see parts warehouse website .
prospect,no there's nothing in this screen.
rep,there is parts warehouse. yeah okay great so uh parts warehouse one of our early customers and they've been using us for a couple of years now so the business problem that they had was that they had two kinds of customers coming on there site and let me give you about the other time what what parts warehouse does today is that they sell vacuum vacuum cleaner parts so the kind of visitors they have on their website are two kinds. one people who know what part number they are looking for facility there so two kind of customers one who knows exactly what part number they are looking for two people who know the model of the vacuum part that they need to buy the vacuum the model of the vacuum cleaner that they need to buy the parts for and before they came to unbxd this is how their website look like right they had searched by part search by model two search boxes the problem with this this whole approach was that now the onus was completely on to the customer to decide what search bar to use what if they pick the wrong search box you now have to optimize and and you have to optimize two search boxes in two different ways.
rep,the way we solve this for them was if you see here i start typing it typing in the bissel b-i-s-s-e-l the immediately we start getting results on the left-hand side what you see are the paths and on the right-hand side other bissell vacuum cleaner models. so customer can now options can show you. here is a grocery customer one of the largest grocery customers in the apac region they were in the news last month as they are saving 150 million in this year our deed on the funding now if we look back at at our grocery run we usually end up buying similar products every time and before using this approach they this they notice that every customer used to take at least 70 to 80 clicks to buy on an average 14 to 15 products and something that they have been regularly buy right. so the way we solved this for them if you'll notice the moment i start typing in c h i c now the customer has the ability to add the you know select the products increase the quantity and add them to the cart right here from the search box and and and for a repeat customer people who know exactly what they want this makes it really simple for them and apart from this what we also what we also give them the
rep,ability to do is show some commonly searched terms on the right hand side some popular brands and and some some categories also within the research results here these are highly personalized meaning. if i was buying say chicken liver on on my regular shopping on big basket for me the chicken liver would be on top whikle if you were buying the masala chicken that would be on top for you. so that's the kind of personalization for each of the visitor on the website. the third example that i want to show you was four rods they are let me actually show you us patriot.
rep,yeah so they sell apparel primarily the army apparels for the for the citizens actually and here if you see the moment i type in ni it surely showa nike and top nike products on on the right hand side but it also opens up a few more category or the customers that that they would have never really you see like clogged air 9 line apparel something that maybe because i would have not otherwise looked at so it's that's that's the kind of breath in terms of how you can guide the customer to the best possible are the most relevant products that they might go back to my any any questions.
prospect,no it's quite interesting
prospect,so basically very much connected to doing so this kind of stuff but as you know yourself it takes a lot of fine-tuning figuring out what what the combination works what does not work how to do ranking and so on some house is very very straightforward more or less you took the initial version was using solr and that was pretty much out of the box using it as it is just beautiful texture and then what we do with the category pages is basically just return the results based on the specific keys and then just retrieve the data that was there and then the ranking that be was very stupid it's just like by how many products how many sold in the last 14 days or something like that and then that's how we rank the product so and currently it's just a document database that we just do full-text search on and. so that much is good but we also know that we need to enrich it a lot with a lot of data and that is where the challenge is so and and to mention one thing because we have outside ones in multiple languages so we try to localize our website to each each country that we go into currently and we have seven websites but six different country we're not calm just like you know serving everybody else who speaks english. so and and the plan is to open lo local company so within the next couple of months we've got the french websites belgium is coming up poland austria so four more sites planning for this year so obviously this a lot of products that means translated and furthermore in order to do like some of the stuff demoing so far just right t's like we would never write te es for for product because this is name for it. what we wanna do is just focus on writing what the real name of the product is what does the grow and call the card and make sure that all the other websites go in and and translate it to the in the correct format and then later on then we could do things like you know keywords and so on but we have another product so this takes a lot of times like in which it with it's some of the stuff yeah yeah some things that would make it really cool to work with you that's the main challenge.
rep,i i completely understand and fesal so just to give you an overview unbxd have solved 80 to 90% of these problems who are strong algorithm and then the solution and that we bring to the table and for and and then there would always be i can tell you no one can can get you 100% perfect site search right but how we reach closer to 100% is by giving you the control through our merchandising dashboard and i'll show i'll walk you features available something that we take care of and then we'll walk you through the merchandising dashboard wherein you can still go and find you based on your system. because a where you sell t-shirts the other websites don't ride so you know your business best and that's why you need to also have some sort of control to take you to that hundred percent. and you can certainly do that with unbxd and very easy and seamless i would say sounds good?.
prospect,yeah continue please.
rep,great so before i get into some of the other features how do we address the research relevance so with regards to the search relevance right let that be t-shirts written as tees new balance is written as nv shoes right these all queries fall into twelve different query types correct. and and this is how we describe them and we solve all of these through our algorithm all of them and just to give you an example say a red dress that's a feature search where in red being the feature of the dress or say 21 inch tv right so instead of writing 21 inch you we end up writing 21 coats double quotes tv that's a linguistic shortcut query type so so we have built our system to understand all of this and then the results.
rep,and then error tolerance our automated multi-word spell checks we not only go ahead and correct the misspelled words but we also at the same time start showing results right and and this so this doing this way you don't put the onus on the customer to the two shows to agree to something right a lot of websites you would have seen did you mean and then you go and click on it and that's when it's our show users there is we understand our star showing the results which are the best match to the misspelled keywords in inner query and the strength of this spellcheck algorithm that that that you have tested out is it works up to six words misspells with two alphabets is each one right that's the kind of the strength with spell check algorithm that we have automated stemming so dress dresses center central all of this is taken care of automatically by unbxd you don't have to go to the back end and then start conjugate any of these stem the words right game gaming center central or even for plurals for that matter laptops for laptop or our cables for cable right.
prospect,how many languages which you does covered do you deal with translations.
rep,so primarily we do this for english and any latin based languages so any lang language which has latin characteristics we can take care of them. so by the way we we are currently integrating with one of the largest retailers in romania i'm not sure you've heard of them but
rep,they call as emag dot io e-m-a-g and they also have sites in multiple languages romanian being one of their primary website so we can surely manage the multiple languages in websites. cool synonyms so we also give you the ability to bill to create synonyms from the dashboard and let me tell you all all these synonyms are automatically taken care of by unbxd but then there are certain industry jargon that we would not be aware of. so to give you an example of a bay area based customer who sells weightlifting gadgets in in the weightlifting worlds while they call the shoes as lifters and there's no way the system would know that very lifting shoes the calla as lifters and and so in those kind of scenario what happens is you can go back to our dashboard and create synonyms for jargons which are specifically your industry.
rep,automated redirect search to the category pages right you type in sneakers any anyways you type in sneakers you'll be immediately be taken to the category page and and this is an automatically direct you do not have to do anything at your end. head query search so in your in your world say if i was to go and look for nike you you carry nike t-shirts nike shoes nike football right this is one interpretation that we have done for one of our customer put in nike you would have four to five different categories to search from and but at the same time showing the most relevant or the most popular products on your site for that particular search query right away so you are still giving the customer an opportunity select a different category if he is looking only for a football you have a category here go and click on on football and we'll get all the footballs but then we spell show various different results of nike maybe say shoes being more popular will start shoot scene the shoes right away. bucketed it search so here there is an other interpretation of bucketed search let me let me just play this video for you so that this is a demo site we did for the outline who's an apparel brand i think based out of uk.
prospect,the screen is gone.
rep,okay one moment.
prospect,yeah it's back.
rep,okay great so they sell apparel's primarily designer apparel's so alexander wang is a designer the moment i and and you know there are a lot of different products available by alexander wang. so the moment someone leaves for alexander wang you have totes you have shoulder bags and you have dresses to select from and also you are kind of with the ability to horizontally scroll across a particular category. dynamic filters so today when we look at your website all your search queries have static filters similar filters so i'll let that be shoes versus t-shirts we all know that the shoes filters versus the filters of literally two shoes might not be applicable to the shirts right and and that's why we give you the ability to define filters for each category no matter how an individual is searching for those for products in a particular category those filters would automatically kick in.
rep,so just to give you an example here no matter where you type in men's casual shoes casual shoes or shoes you see the shoes filter while on the same website if you were looking for men's casual shirts or shorts formal shirts any any kind of shirts right automatically there's the shirt filters would kick in and which are much more relevant.
rep,variances so i'm not sure if you carry any variances may be say in t-shirts are in shoes to do that like maybe the color variances i'm sure you might be carrying size variances but.
prospect,yes yes basically only the only size variances.
rep,okay cool so this is something so as far as we have this typically works with color variances if you have different images for a particular product right indexed well we can we unbxd has the ability to show the right products so in this case if you're looking for a red dress and if there is an image for the red dress only the the we will go ahead and show the red image and not the white or the black image of the same same dress right. color synonyms what we have done is built up built a huge corpus of the color synonyms meaning if i was to come and look on your website for a red t-shirt if if you have a red t-shirt that's the first thing that we will show if you do not have a red t-shirt right what and and if you call it as a crimson t-shirt or a chary shirt unbxd because of the unbxd color synonym corpus we have the ability to identify that you're looking for products from the red color family and we would end up showing the red color products on top then showing the black or the white . zero result page so today a lot of websites do not show any products for any <> of junk or you know junk queries typed in there and we all know that we will end up having a zero results page.
rep,the way we solved it for one of our customers a debora lipman for actually most of our customers if we give the customer the ability to continue their journey in two ways. one is giving this recently viewed widget out here meaning the customer can go back to what they were looking at so far on your site or making the appropriate recommendations these recommendations are made based on what they have been doing on your website or what other kind of products and what are they most likely to buy we would start recommending the price so the customer doesn't have to go to the search bar they can they can start their journey where once again by clicking on any one of these products or our widgets and they can go to. search results a similar product so then i am looking for nike shoes 100 shoes i just love one shoe and there could be several reasons right it could be the color i cook the price point it could be various different reasons why i love that shoes and we give the ability for you to show similar products in a modal window the customer clicks on the similar products link here a modal window opens up shows similar quickly shows you know quite a few similar products customer light so they can click on the product and go ahead they don't like it they can quickly close the modal window and continue looking at the products what they were on the site all right it's an all here's an alternative for the same feature on mobile.
rep,so do you have a mobile site is it responsive or.
prospect,yes its responsive.
rep,okay here is a mobile auto suggest the way we address this is by giving scope suggestions and the most recent searches here's another interpretation on mobile with the category refinement and then this is the multiple multi select four filters which really works well on mobile. great so i walked you through so far you know i showed you some things on the site show you the the auto suggests and how we address all of this search relevance now let me bring in my colleague to show you the back end dashboard which completes our solution that gives you the complete control in terms of how you merchandise the the products. hai fasal how are you?.
prospect,i'm fine how are you?.
rep,okay my name is monal let me share my screen here okay can you see my screen fasale.
rep,okay perfect so this is what our dashboard looks like today and you can see a very quick overview in terms of where what the status is of the current in of the current indexes you can manage multiple sites through the same dashboard so let's say if you have a dev staging or a production environment you can manage all through the same sort of a login you can define what your skills are searchable not searchable. this is something we'll help you set up you can also define your global facets and as as ashish had mentioned will also show you how you can override them for specific categories to create dynamic filters but you can define what your global facets are you can also define your synonyms so you can define bi-directional and unidirectional synonyms and we also want to repeat ourselves in saying this as all that as you might have experienced in solar or elasticsearch a lot of spelling mistakes have to be solved by creating synonyms on the back end right. you do not you do not have to create those synonyms for unbxd 85 to 90% of spelling mistakes are automatically solved by unbxd  system so you don't need to create those synonyms but if you have jargons industry-specific jargons let's say for example in weightlifting world's shoes are called lifters right that something cannot be automated so we easily put in a synonym in there you can easily put in a synonym for that.
rep,now let's say you wanted to give again in solr and elasticsearch you might have your it team your cto your it team gets busy because the merchandising team is coming up with constant changes on how they want to merchandise the pages right . you want to get away from doings that so we have created this ability which you can expose to your merchandising and marketing team when they can come in and directly make changes to any page any search results. so let's say they wanted to make any changes to all the queries all the search results they can make it in the global section here or if they wanted to make specific query changes.
rep,so let's take an example say dress as an example and this is what my search results for dress looks like on this demo site i go to the backend dashboard i create a rule i click on merchandise and will open up in a window that will show you exactly the same results that you see you saw on the website in a visual form right. so this way your merchandising team will have access to this visual merchandising tool now you can filter based on any attribute that you have shared with us in your catalog you can promote you can promote by sorting boosting or slotting so let's find boosting real quick okay let's categories you have very few products or for some search queries you have very few products you just want to move them around you can just drag and drop them and pin them so if you want specific set of products to show up in a specific set of order and just drag and drop and pin them. so now if you go to the site you'll see exactly what i curated on the back hand shows up on the website well the eliza products up top and the two that i pinned in the first two positions. now let's say you wanted to do something slightly different where you wanted to slot or organize a particular position of the product so let's say in the third position for some queries you always want to show different brands so let's say for the query shoes or cheap shoes or her fancy shoes or sports shoes whatever the maybe you want to show one adidas one puma one nike shoes okay you can then define each position or a range of positions and define a rule so let's say for position three i'll say i want brand that contains ralph lauren so now in this third position i'll always get a ralph lauren product so let's say this particular product goes out of stock goes out of inventory or becomes inactive the system will automatically find the next most probable out ralph lauren dress and replace it here so you can always define what particular block of product listing what type of brand or product or whatever rule that your merchant wants will show.
prospect,so this is this kind of disregards relevance well.
rep,but it enhances relevance in two different ways so relevance will bring in to say okay i'm searching for dress i want to show dress so the relevant system will bring in all the dresses our user behavior system will also bring in the ability to show your popular dress products but sometimes merchants need to override the system because of a business rule so business might be say i have a particular product that is very high in inventory for example now if you expose that product you might at least reduce the inventory it may not be your best selling but you might be putting it on sale you might have reduced the price whatever the case may be . so your merchants team can now boost and organize the product selection in such a way that it exposes different products to the customer so yes it's sort of it's not against the grain of relevancy it's just trying to combine relevancy and business rules. because everything after that is still based on relevancy as you can see.
rep,now let's say you're merchandising team or marketing team also wants to create a custom campaigns so let's say i will call it april clearance 2016 2016 so searched for april clearance i didn't find any search results so let me go again to this page i'll create a rule click of merchandise obviously it's not gonna match anything to the catalog because it's such a unique keyword so i go into the right-hand side here in say convert to landing page click on that button click ok now the entire catalog is available for you to curate. so you can now come in and say let's say let's big brand again bran contains ralph and then let's say i promote that's a sowed based on price this is what i want customers to see for april clearance right. now search for april clearance i'll see this so now what you can do is you can take this url and put it in your email campaign social media campaigns ppc ads whatever we have you when customers click on those they'll come straight to this page that you merchantise curate. it then next thing is doing quickly is the category rules so one of the things that our sheet had mentioned was how we dynamically show filters based on that particular category.
rep,so let's say you have a category called slippers let's say for example you can merchandise um slippers and you can come in and say you know what for this particular category i think size is the most important filter they show color i'll hide whatever this category thing and tax thing is these are the four filters i want to show four slippers in this order now a customer can search for slippers in a thousand different ways slippers men's slippers women slippers blue slippers doesn't matter how they search for slippers these four filters will automatically show up in this order of importance that you've defined and you can do that for category or subcategory you can do the same thing by banners. so let's say you had 10% off all slippers so you want to make sure that this banner shows up no matter how customer search for slippers search for slippers okay any questions so far.
prospect,it's really dope.
rep,well thank you the next piece i want to quickly show you is the our reporting dashboard.
rep,i'm assuming do you use google analytics today.
prospect,yeah we do.
rep,got it so google analytics has a particular limitation so let's say if i went to your site and i searched for nike t-shirts or one of the examples that ashish were showing i don't find good results then i go to the category page i go through the navigation and i find the product i'm looking for and i end up bind it but google will tell you is that that search session had a conversion which is true but it's misleading right i searched in that session and i bought in that session but those who are not correlated so you will think that that particular query is doing awesome in which inpact it's not doing really well so unbxd actually fixes that problem and based on that principle we create three tiers of reporting so the top tier will give you an idea of the exact overview of what search results look like from a conversion funnel perspective second would be your top search queries very helpful for your ppc campaigns top products that are being added to cart top click products and zero results queries. now zero results queries by the way you can handle and manage them the same way we did that april clearance query right you can create converted it to its landing page and show curated products that you want to show . the second tier is showing results per query so now let's say with unbxd you your conversion rate is 5% let's say just for sake of discussion which query is now performing at half a percent or 1 percent you can easily drill down into this individual query and see why particular queries not perform you can see what the trend line of that queries was that query always underperforming or used to really perform well and now suddenly it has gone down you can see what products show up particularly for that query and what is the conversion funnel of that query.
rep,and the same thing is also available for per product so now you can drill down into an individual product and see the trend line what queries it shows up or in the conversion file any questions fasal.
prospect,no that's really cool .
rep,okay alright awesome so let me give this back to ashish and again if you have any questions of the dashboard please don't hesitate to let me know .
prospect,interesting anyway love data love data.
rep,well you want not only you have data but you have accurate data that actually tells you what's really happened which is important. great guys so yeah that's that's what we had i just want to quickly check it recover everything.
rep,yeah so that's that's what do you have from the from a solution perspective here is a snapshot from one of our customer before and
prospect,before and after you see my screen.
prospect,looks good i mean so so far i really like what i've seen it's it's quite interesting and some of the challenges that we we know we have and we would like to solve it elegantly but you know we in e-commerce which we cover a lot so there's a lot of things that's going on and it's not always that you have the terms like really focus on two things alone and and realize all the potential there isn't in things like making the search work really well looks like you guys took your time and actually internet so i like that a lot. but i'm one of them curious about is like how so what is your product exactly so is this like a hosted solution of some sort or is this something that i can install or is it is it you guys helping us build this on solr or elasticsearch how yeah what is the product.
rep,okay so yeah so fasal we have previous of implementing our solutions and then if if you look at me its primarily sas based solution and and we have you know we have these three different ways based on what we have been hearing from customers and how they prefer we have realized that up these three ways work the best one is the most quickest and the easiest i would say is the hosted approach then comes the ajax so in hosted everything i would say except for the header and the footer the solution is primarily these i will show you an example actually just a moment let me show you how we do this some. you would be hosting the in the whole product head logins and the saying the categories and so on here you see rods dot com.
prospect,yeah i don't know it's not there but you don't have to show it i think i get the picture so you one solution is you provide a service and then we will be calling it and then just getting some some jason back right.
rep,yes okay right so just quickly i'll i'll show you this so the moment i search say for boots on rods this url here search dot rods dot com right there is something that's hosted by unbxd.
rep,so i yeah and the customer customer does not seen the difference this happens in real real time and for most of the searches you see this happening in below 30 milliseconds right. the other the other approach that we have is the the ajax way of doing so here with us patriot tactical this is the ajax implementation that we have done so if i was to say type in nike the header and the footer is something which is rendered by us patriot while the search results here are something which are injected by unbxd right and then the third way of. search results here are something which are injected by unbxd right and then the third way of.
rep,so ashish just to jump in real quick so fasal one of the key differences so ashish just to jump in real quick so fasal one of the key differences between the first approach of the second approach was the us the address bar you can see that in rods it actually went to a sub-domain but says here you still maintain your domain just wanted to make sure we clarify the difference. and the third way would be through the api through the back-end system. on the back-end system is basically using api so we have restful api that we've created all which obviously gives you the most control but also puts a little bit more onus on your team to implement this so for our recommendation fasal is to keep it simple but still within your purview using the ajax is the best approach.
prospect,so this is this is kind of a big thing because it's our whole website we are kind of a bunch of guys dedicated to or more less doing this for a living so giving away the whole essentially the whole back-end is not so that's something that we're like i know the team the team's not gonna be super excited about like you know hey fasal.
rep,not to interrupt you but i don't think that we're taking over the system so what we are essentially doing is you're only giving us your catalogue and the analytics you're still in control of the entire ecommerce platform all we are taking away is your search results page.
prospect,that's it and like all the search results if everything is reversed with the website all the categories are super elastic search and so basically the catalog you're looking at is soon to be a search that's why it's like super crucial and is quite important you know
prospect,we can customize it and we still kind of done the best we could it's quite pathetic i know but this is something that we would like to improve on so but your your product is like a hundred simple priority so this means that you know whatever we might learn from base or whatever you guys are doing it's not necessarily going to trickle down to any other parts of the platform which i understand what i'm saying the the key thing for us here is the data like okay how how can we further analyze the things that we have a whole englishman and you guys clearly know how to do that.
rep,so faysal why can't we why can't you continue using elastic search for your category pages because that's more of a control system anyways but for search which requires a bit of semantics and and a little bit more technology use us and i understand that everything is searched today but essentially if you demarcated that way that the true search query results you use unbxd and start there and see what it actually brings benefit to your team so you can actually see that ok this is actually working for us now you can put more control on it because you didn't go in and write elasticsearch right you obviously it's an open source you manipulated it so the same thing is available through unbxd you can take the api you can define it how you want to but also freeze your team up from doing this merchandising pieces which is not something your team wants to do anyways right i mean it's not there's no challenge in that there's no challenging moving a product from fifth position to first position give it to the merchants use our dashboard and the more challenging pieces would be really trying to figure out to say what is actually happening with the data. so search can still be powered through us your category pages can still be powered through elasticsearch once you feel that ok this is this is a good happy medium you can then decide to say do we want to continue to invest in elasticsearch or we can use unbxd to do the category pages also in the future if you want it to and and invest it through restful api and now you are actually doing more than what just elasticsearch is allowing you to write because create solving spell check by creating synonyms is not the most healthiest way to solve problems. and want to bring in a technology that really solves it so that's what we're trying to really say bring your happy medium try us out you're not saying that replace everything on day one but at least see to bring in because ultimately the goal is no matter what you do is to increase conversions right that's what we'll be the bread and butter for everybody.
prospect,yes yes oh this is what i like the most about your product is obviously where we can we want to cut the short cuts as fast as possible meet the customer where he is in their regards it makes perfect sense so yeah that point i'm with you just for the search part because this takes a lot of time and it takes a lot for the englishman all the data that we have at the end of the day is basically yeah who owns the data is if you guys are us i know that you are actually it's like algorithm and so on but yeah i don't know.
rep,well legally and technically you own the data it is your data it's your it's your content we are just posting it to enable certain services but ultimately you are the owner of the data and you have access to the data to our reporting.
rep,we don't take your data and resell it by the way just.
prospect,no no no no what i'm what i meant was i don't want to say like today we're more or less using elasticsearch as a kind of like a document database right so you can dynamically add attributes whatever we want just use this as filters so this makes it super easy we can more or less bypass the database directly just for directing elasticsearch because that's where it's gonna be used and that's where it makes sense to keep it things like that where it would make we kind of like to keep that control you understand what i'm saying .
rep,sure as you still are in control see any catalog changes that you make we will rely on you giving us the catalog your merchants don't need to come in into our system they cannot make catalog changes they can only manipulate search results so you make you are in control of the catalog you are in control of the data you'll make facets you create facets filters changed whatever you want to do it's up to you you just have to tell us and our system sort of enables the semantic relevance piece and we've built all this merchandising pieces around that allows to allows you to dump all this other non challenging stuff to the merchandising in the marketing team right that's the ultimate goal to free up your resources to really think about in solving other bigger problems to solve problems rather than just do synonyms and merchandiser is essentially the idea. hmm give it back to sahish for any next steps i think there's a couple of things they want to ask so i'll give it to ashish.
rep,hey thank you monal and faizal just wanted to check was curious you know what what is your catalog size today from an overall parent skews perspective.
prospect,thirteen thousand products give or take.
rep,and roughly what could be the patient's you get every month on average.
prospect,well we get numbers from new relic somewhere like one half a million a week but this is spread out across this six seven domains.
prospect,so it's all about two million sessions a month.
rep,which we pretend million pageviews i guess.
prospect,something something like that yeah and this is like also one of the things are like you know we obviously as a technical team would like to be in control over things so if there is a down't i'm not saying that there is but you know we sort of like know okay great we know this week awesome product is gonna come we don't get a lot of traffic so we start racking up the servers and things like that and this is some of the things that you know would like to feel that we in control log right because if something goes wrong everybody's in our office like hey what did you do so these are some of the things that it's like hard to let go given their you know search is kind of a crucial thing and we're using it for or more throughout the system huh.
rep,yeah i totally get that and just to give you some confidence a) see there are two ways to look at it so one we want to prove adding a partner a technology partner to power your search a makes commercial sense to you i didn't start testing without evaluating us we have a 90-day evaluation period we will come and implement the product use the powder for 60 days see if you are making the difference if we charge you x a month do you get 10 in it sort of it if we if you get 10 to 15 x out of it then it makes commercial sense for used to so you to continually use unbxd otherwise it doesn't make the some some level of letting go of control as well so let's do a more like an ajax kind of implementation i know you're not have great control initially but this is just to prove value but once that's done let's take the api route where we give you much much more control and from an infrastructure standpoint our entire infrastructure is amazon web serviece they don't go down and we have a deal with ibm softlayer.
rep,yeah so that will give it it's an extremely robust platform and we've soon written multiple zones across amazon across the world because we are these global customers with this team then with mirroring that they've enabled on the platform itself so from a dia perspective you're fairly fairly well covered and there are these large enterprises right we have new and we've actually an expression target for its international sites they they all use us so and and and trust me once you see see the value associated and if you start showing you that n x 15 x ro and if we can come in and in 90 days improve your site conversions and two digits even if it's a as low as 10% if we can make that difference then you start trusting us more if we can show you a very very flowery presentation sure we'll show you a bunch of big names that we work with but site i know as this extremely internal what works for a customer x will probably not work for you the same way. i was a big fans of actually trying on the hole right at so many custom he lost one year especially like 500 600 customers just primary by this approach use it for three months see how you feel if you if it makes sense to you commercially then you invest more time resources go the api route have better control and we will do what we do best. cause what i think what i can see like being solution for may be trying out the api operations basically just communicating with the via the back end because we also have a team of dedicated from 10 people or more or less just doing this that's kind of suffer had a design team that would like to be very much more hands-on so the api solution would work for us we're like try it out you know pass some of the queries there i can see you and see what kind of results we will be getting from there compare them to ours and and that works out we're pretty much on board i think because as you demoed before they came back our search results could be a lot lot better what i'm curious about is how you guys would solve the language problems and things like that we ourselves so like almost given up it's not something we'll be giving up since it's quite important but it's this is where we needed some help.
rep,and how many languages you support and you said at this point in time.
prospect,six different languages and we're adding more so.
rep,okay fair enough soap yeah i'm as i told you this 90 days is primarily for that i would say a quick reasonable short see what will happen in the first 90 days and which will be as fast and agile as possible from our end will not able to your development resources because we don't want you to be investing way too much time before we you actually .
prospect,unlike other customers we would very much like to be involved.
rep,okay so we are more than happy and let me tell them here this but if you if you want us to if you want to be involved people to good we have customers where they love being involved i actually have one b2b implementation going on right now with a milwaukee-based open iv supply we actually have our engineers on their site working with them day in and day out and we do these calls every single day for the larger team also we get to know what's going on so we are very happy if you want this to be no problem with that.
prospect,yeah absolutely so yeah control is kind of important to us and ultimately yes the search results for the end user but for longevity of collaboration and things it would be so basically being in control and and having having all the sense of you know whatever we invested our time in in doing usually bubbles over to other parts of the business so that that part is well just naturally benefits and the whole team of developers that we have in our team are like working on different technologies and whatever they're working on sort of bubbles over to the next department and so on so this is something that we we value a lot you know starting with something at them coming up with something completely different this is this is and it's.
rep,as i told you we don't hear this way too often it's it's it's like music to my ears so short and i the way i look at it as see three months we come and we work with you we involve in every state of what we do and we take it live and you see the results to yourself even if you don't see a magic wand that we wove and you don't see 50% improving conversion even if you see something in the way i would look at it is we would have helped you probably learn this whole search semantics much better probably everyone will know how we actually do it so that way you are probably in better control of the whole dynamics.
prospect,yeah i mean i switch things on my website and i look i know it's shit but i've also been part of implementing it and i know my daily shit so there's a lot of manual work in electrons with that kind of data so.
rep,we'll work on this together.
prospect,yes you know you know it's not just the search because we will be enriching the products with a lot of data that would make it relevant for for the user to search on it directly on our website but you know if some of this data could also be bubbled over to the rest of the product page for example this would also mean that you know this is some of the data that google would index and it would also make our search more i don't know relevant for weird keywords or phrases that people are also searching for directly in google and not just directly on our website these are the kind of things i'm thinking you know it's very valuable to have you know you're starting reaching the data somewhere you know i should bubble over to the rest of the system what's wrong i was asking who owns the data and where does it go.
rep,well you definitely write what you technically end up doing from our technology you can this builder connector where we can start importing data real time because the wave like customers like newegg where data work with you're making this work and at any point i'm feel that you're making way so don't worry about it make sure the control remains don't worry on that. sounds good so what is the next step then the.
prospect,no no. i like to demo it to the rest of the team i mean if you guys could send us some documentation or maybe.
rep,yeah sure i can do that i can just share the same a similar deck probably not this detail probably a shortened version of this tag that yoginis past i'll also send you the implementation approach we discussed we have a high-level overview of implementation that we do with all the three approaches we spoke about i share that with you as well so that you can review it but again beyond everything if you're open for the poc i would love to jump in and start poc as early as a week to two weeks from now get on and if you call i understand the scope and deploy my resources either on-site other mods and get me started.
prospect,cool yeah we there's a big tournament there's a big football so on running in june so up until then we'll be it'd be good to have some some sort of proof of concept good up and running .
rep,yeah we can get started as early as next week so you don't have any issues from our side.
prospect,concept good up and running . yeah we can get started as early as next week so you don't have any issues from our side. cool. cool.
rep,we can also discuss commercials if you would be interested to know as to what's the investment required overall.
prospect,yeah i was hoping you're gonna send me that okay we're gonna go through them here.
rep,i can give you a ballpark number so quickly there are two components involved one is a one-time setup fee and and then obviously the monthly fees it's a sas model for a side of your size with about 13000 product is about two million sessions a month we are technically listening at a costing of about four thousand dollars three and a half to four thousand dollars overall this is considering site search and product recommendations and a money oh yeah three and a half thousand dollars so you're looking at probably an annual cost of about roughly about forty thousand dollars .
prospect,and what is the setup fee.
rep,set up  are generally is is between that i will get them exactly once we do the implementation scope it's usually two months of whatever is the monthly recurring fee so it will generally be between three and a half to seven thousand dollars depending on how much of effort is involved from our side but that in figure out once we do an implementation spoke quad and what we do in the roi period this to give you a little more comfort we would like to have our skin in the game we only collect 50% of the desired implementation fees say if you finalize the implementation fees a at five thousand dollars you we pace two and a half thousand dollars we go ahead implement the solution you use the solution for ninety days and at the end of the 90 days you take a call if you and in those 90 days we only collect fifty percent of the monthly save the monthly fee is three and a half thousand dollars you only pay a seventeen fifty a month use it for three months and after three full months of serving it on live traffic if you don't like what you see you just move away the fifty percent set up fee assigned the fifty percent monthly because as we love is that fair.
prospect,huh.
rep,i would have to see the numbers and actually make make a good assessment of it but .
prospect,yeah. i mean it's i would say if it solves all the power although all the solutions that you've them all so far if it solves that we're talking about this basically a person's salary half a person salary annually so yeah it's it's doable.
rep,i'm glad you looked at it that way i'll give you the same example again if you had told me to the expensive but yeah so that's the way we look at it and and again as i told you three months it's the onus is on us to provide you and get happy to do that.
prospect,yeah i will connect i'll get back to you know probably won't be next week would say mid may and by then i should have had i'm not gonna be at office next week.
rep,so that's why so for the week after should we set up a time for tuesday.
prospect,and i would like to have the time to like their discuss it with the teams or go through with them so far it's only pin that myself and phillip whom you contacted get sort of .
prospect,let's check it out and so i'll have to catch up with them and then go through the the solutions if you've got forth i mean as i said the biggest the biggest challenge to seven your products to a company like ours is that we build everything ourselves right this is this is the main thing that we this is the biggest hurdle and obviously it makes sense because if you clear doing it better than we are so and if we can prove that the better.
rep,yeah absolutely thank you if so much feisal wonderful talking to you no good weak in the head .
prospect,yeah you too.
prospect,thanks guys.
rep,thank you. thanks
prospect,well it's sad i feel like might be able to do something here.
rep,sure i can do that.
rep,so is your website now on shopify or your team has built in platforms.
prospect,no it is not on shopify it is so we have a site set up on shopify that url is shop 4h dot org that's shipped for - h dot org it's a really rough template of the supply theme and we loaded a few products on there just to kind of see how it works and look at the backend and stuff and it all works great. we are in the process of selecting a vendor to do like the design and development work for like some ux stuff but the assumption i mean we're pretty much already planning to use you guys and this is kind of an informational call to figure out what services you guys offer what level we should you know sign up for at and all stuff and we're at we're on shopify plus.
rep,ok awesome sure i can i can walk you through so from a timeline perspective i'm just trying to get a timeline by when are you expecting if if all goes well when do you think you would start implementing something like site search or product discovery solution on the site.
prospect,well that is probably what i'm talking to you right now so our timeline we have a few things that are that are some moving pieces the first one is actually getting shopify approved as a vendor and getting that membership started which we just completed last week after a long and arduous process so we're on board with shopify 100% we've evaluated bigcommerce and volusion and a few other ones and shopify is the best bet given our limited or zero in-house development that we have. the next step is we have a product in a erp integration so we use say math 500 to do all of our like inventory and order fulfillment and all that stuff and i'd love to get rid of mass but our whole organization we're not just an e-commerce company we have a conference center and fundraisers and everybody uses mass so if we weren't on mass the whole thing would fall to pieces. so we have to be on mass so we've selected ebridge connections to do the integration between shopify and mass 500. the work on that is set to start fairly soon i think we actually just made our first payment maybe today so i think the timeline that is six to eight weeks and supposedly when that connection is built the all of our products will show up on in the shopify admin. now they're not going to have all the product descriptions and the images and all that stuff but they're going you know they're gonna be our products will be there in the backend supposedly i yet to see if that's actually gonna happen but that's how it's supposed to work because one of the data feeds is from erp 2 to shopify for product information so we shall see what happens there so that work is six to eight weeks. and so we're looking at probably starting that thursday so realistically we won't start that till next week and let's just say eight weeks for the sake of you know giving ourselves plenty of time so that's october no it's september november like the week of november seventh right so that's what we're looking at .
prospect,so sometime between the 11th of november is when that integration will be complete now we've got the we're selecting a vendor to do the design and development of this site you know there are some things that we we have two other sister sites that we want to use or that we are using like for like look and feel for h org and 4-h center . they both built on wordpress and certain things like the header and the trays and things like that are our items we want to mimic for our new site. right as well as things like you know making three pages and product pages all look like they're part of this cohesive brand . so that's what the the developers were working on realistically we we have a budget for that which i'm not able to disclose to you but all of the proposals came back well above our budget and largely because i think we over scoped the user experience side of things we really just want someone we're gonna kind of do mostly ux stuff in-house when it comes to basically when it comes to information architecture . and then we're going to utilize the the agency for you know design and development and qa realistically given the change in scope that we're dealing with we probably wouldn't have the design agency start working on something until the first week of october so like sometime between the 3rd and the 7th of october because they need to we need to adjust the scope then the vendors need to come back with their revised presentations and slash proposals and then we'll be able to decide from there and also find out if we need to request more money from our capital stuff . so so those are the mean realistically that's our timeline and that's kind of the long vision is we've got the design work starting maybe the 1st of october the integration work completing that second week of november and i don't know when the best time to start up with unbxd is given those different things.
prospect,you know we i'm from what i've read i think that we really want to use unbxd we know that site search is kind of a piece of trash on our current site and we want to minimize our level of manual labor on the you know as we continue to do this. we'd love to know what you think the best time to start with you guys would be and what features or what products we should be utilizing you guys have on offer.
rep,sure so i'll show you our two products basically to be the site search and product recommendations those are the two core pieces of the solution is an another piece that's navigation which will be out and of this year it is still in beta and for for a couple of our customers in the apac who are testing it out but q4 is when we are trying to release the full and final product and then that would be the third piece but i'll not walk you through that today i'll primarily keep our discussion around site search and spend some time on recommendations that's that's what we can do. so let me complete or share my screen so you did you have a chance to look at the report that was shared the product usability report.
prospect,i mean no i mean it's all fairly simple that the fact that nobody can find anything on our site you know but we have the benefit of having kind of a monopoly on some of our products so that's all well and good but it doesn't help us grow our user base at all so it's it's it's a pretty damning report.
rep,okay so i i just shared the screen are you able to see that.
rep,okay here is the agenda i prepared for the call today i might look long but on high level want you to discuss four things talk to you a little about who we are show you or walk you through the current state of the union which i'm which i'm sure you're aware of i'll not spend much time on that before h small site and the performance in terms of search and recommendation today three so you show you some of the sights as problem that we have solved today and lastly we can discuss any other details like the implementation process or pricing and any other questions you might have even during the presentation if you have any questions just feel free to pause me and then ask me any questions at any given point in time hope that works for you.
rep,okay awesome so to talk a little about us we are a five and a half year old company
rep,headquartered in sunnyvale california with offices in chicago and india we have our core engineering team working out of the sunnyvale office we have our customer success and support team and also a part of sales team working out of chicago and some of the backend engineering work also happens in india because we are are one of the largest search providers in apac we have people from twitter yahoo search microsoft work for us so that we have best in minds from the silicon valley but for unbxd we are at 80 employees today everyone everyone is an engineer and we love to build and break things. we have over 350 plus customers in the us 1200 plus customers globally.
rep,here are some of our customers a very high level snapshot from an enterprise space we work with newegg dot com ashley homes for the largest online furniture store in the us express one of the large fashion apparel line they have around 60000 products 400 plus stores in the us ib supply i'm not sure if you've heard of ib supply they are called as industry industries for the blind is what they are called they basically do large government and other organizations military defense so a very niche business of their b2b. from a branch of speciality sites perspective of the dibora lipman vacparts pair puravida bracelets um they're very niche businesses puravida bracelets only bracelets vacparts sells vacuum cleaner parts and other home appliance parts.
rep,platforms we support all ecommerce platform available out there these are just few examples give shopify magento big commerce volusion any of those e-commerce platform or any homeground ecommerce platform as well so we have the ability to integrate into any of those.
rep,here are some of our customers who are in integration today they will be going live by end of this year hh greg lowe's cvs pharmacy us auto parts fresh direct hp bed bath & beyond.
rep,all of them are in implementation there on the enterprise side every customer has a different challenge that we are trying to solve not just the basic sites or the relevance issues but also much more complicated challenges with regards to how their catalog is today how they're how diversify their catalog versus the audiences right and then how do you start personalizing every piece of information that you start showing to an individual. but this was just a very high-level overview of who we are today any any questions so far.
prospect,yeah can you at some point either and after this call whatever send over a list of all the websites that erna all sites on the shopify platform that are utilizing unbxd.
prospect,just like to check them out.
rep,yes well i'll do that i'll send you some of the big ones and there are a lot there are hundreds of sites on shopify using us because we have our recommendations app plug-in out there right which is much more of serve for smaller companies and so they do that they just go and install it and start using it but not the best examples to look at i'll send you some of the semies or the other midsize businesses wherein we have implemented the site search and recommendations on shopify and then share those examples with you i can do that after the call.
rep,i know you're aware of your current state on the side so state i had spent some time just to create a base in terms of what are the opportunities on the side that we see today and how we come in and make a difference so i'll i'll quickly walk you through this this is not to criticize anyone's work you are well aware of this but but just wanted to kind of show you some other things that we solved right . so the first thing first thing i looked at colleen on your website was the autosuggest when i start typing in something it's important to start guiding the customer to the right categories to the right brands to the right popular products the moment they have typed in the first few alphabets on the search bar right and i see the absence of autosuggest today i'll show you how we do this for all of our customers and approach this in a very different way. then i look at at the site for error tolerance try to do a few mistakes and then see if the system was to auto corrected spellcheck doesn't work curriculum jewelry then i try to misspelled beanies and couple of different ways did not work bottles with the single t did not work. then i look for search relevance tried for t-shirt the first few are hoodies and then tried for jackets the first few products are some of the products are not even jackets there's some sort of patch and that could be probably be put on jacket but not the actual jackets. then look for pen again is a lot of products not been secretary pen the signatory club pen actually doesn't show up.
rep,then i look for keychain versus keyring this is a synonymous word to see what what kind of results i was to get but then again totally different results for keychain versus keyring sweatshirts with space and without space you'll see only one works without the space works whereas with space it does not understand then i look for search results page versus category page whenever someone is looking for something that's in your category it's important to start taking them to that particular category page because the category page has the most or the best curated set of results right . so i look for cam gear and then try and try to search for it and give me a zero result page again same thing activewear looks like you have a category within apparel as active wear when i search for a search for active wear sorry the results of them right. so that was a very high level understanding that that we feel we're there we can come and fix some of these right and let me now show you the unbxd solution. so why unbxd why are we different a lot of competitors out there but on high level three things when technology business framework so from our technology perspective salts several sites as problems are not solved before and and .
rep,we provide a foundation to scale newegg dot com has a hundred million products in the screen with two million products changing every couple of hour then we have us auto parts littke shy of million products ashley furnitures they have a different catalog for different region every geolocation has a different catalog the different pricing right so it is important to show the right products to the people coming coming out of a particular geography.
rep,so these are the kind of challenges that we are solving at scale from a site search perspective business we understand your business why customers buy from you there's always something unique about a business right and then it's important to start replicating that on your product discovery experience to give you an example site search is so intrinsic say that something works for jc's might not work for target and something that works for target might not work for jc so it is it is very important to understand a particular business why customers are buying and then start designing the product discovery piece accordingly and we do that for each of our customer irrespective of the size of the business and lastly framework so you might be aware of all of these challenges you can go and and tune your shopify platform to fix some of these. but what happens three months six months twelve months down the line when you launch a new product a new category new brand how do you ensure that from day one your solution or say site search is optimal right and that's where we come into picture we provide your frame way framework that helps you resolve these challenges from david. and let me know <> with these slides show you a few live customer examples actually let me just see my screen the the parts ware house.
rep,okay so what i wanted to show you some business right how customized the solution can be. so and and when even when i say customized this is no onus at your end or your team it comes to that our end and we do this with your inputs so.
prospect,when you do this okay when you do this kind of customization so when i first will spoke last you mentioned someone said it was like five hundred dollars a month what like for customization like this let's find any parts and three clicks whatever or the search is that is that like a five hundred dollar month thing or are they paying extra for this stuff and if so how much.
rep,no so this is part of the implementation right that's the one one-time setup fee right.
prospect,whats the set up fee.
rep,so the set up fee will again usually be in the range of two to four thousand dollars depending on how much work is needed right how big is the catalog how much is a traffic and how much work is needed in terms of ui ux work at our end so anything between 2 to 4k is what the setup fee would be. and then will be a monthly fee and the monthly fee now we have changed pricing right our monthly fee is directly in relation to your search sessions.
rep,so do you know what your search sessions are today on the site.
prospect,the search sessions.
prospect,no but i think i can look up and google analytics for me .
rep,yes so if you if you can get get that number to me i can also share the pricing with regards to what your monthly fee would look like with the unbxd site search solution.
prospect,on i'm working right now so the way it's a behavior site search overview you a monthly site search.
rep,yes monthy.
prospect,all right let's look for the last year and see oh.
rep,yeah and then make an average of last six months or twelve months just to avoid any peek moves.
prospect,yeah okay so totally you are totally unique searches right and that's what you want.
rep,yes you can give me that out if you have sessions you could also give me.
prospect,yeah search sessions with search.
prospect,and this is i want to do six months all right so forty-seven thousand two hundred and twenty three and that's for six months so for 73 divided by seven.
rep,so make that 10000 searches a month .
rep,so that is something that would come at thousand dollars a month for the search and for the product recomendation that would be additional thousand dollars.
prospect,an additional thousand dollars okay so it's let me write all this down.
rep,that's the monthly recurring fee  i can also send you this information at the end of this call.
prospect,sure i'm gonna i just want to write and write it down right now to yourself unbxd the launch fee or a set up fee.
rep,you can take it down a thousand dollars.
prospect,three thousand okay and then for excite search it's one thousand per month.
prospect,and then for the product recommendations also one thousand per month .
rep,right and and what what we have changed in last few as if a couple of quarters is that we guarantee at least a minimum ten ten percent of uptick in your conversion so we provide you the first sixty ninety days as a poc meaning you will not have a yearly commitment for the first sixty to ninety days of the engagement so within those sixty to ninety days if you don't see increasing the conversion you don't like the solution that we provide then you have no i would say contractual bounding to work with us and then you can walk out of the contract at any given point in time within the sixty ninety days right. so he ensured that the onus is known on our team to start showing you results from the first sixty days of the implementation else we have we are losing the customer right and that's the last thing you would want to do so that's the way we are engaging and that's that's one reason where you see all those big logos out there because it makes it very easier for them to test us out some of the larger organizations even test us out on a smaller scale they come and the first 30 days they'll just use our solution for 10 percent of the traffic and see how the performances and and then slowly grow it 200 percent in the 90 days not risky neatly on onto something new. so that is that that's a new engagement model that that we have today for all our customers trying this out and then that makes it very easy for them to try.
rep,great so let me show you the i'm not sure if you've seen this in
rep,the past but yeah whack parts or parts warehouse they were earlier called vaz parts this in vacuum cleaner or their home appliance parts online did them they had two kind of customers on their website one who knows exactly what part number to buy and others who know the model number for the appliance that they're looking in the past all right.
rep,so before we came in the you so have two different search boxes altogether one for each kind of user or customer on the on the site we came in we said obviously you cannot have two different search boxes because by doing so they're now putting the onus on the customer to select the right search box what if they search a wrong search uses long search box and also at the back in your non complicating the problem right of optimizing two different search boxes altogether . so instead what me what we did is design something like this for them the moment i start typing in bissel you'll notice all the parts for the cell on the left hand side all the models for the cell on the right hand side and all the top searches for the bissel on the right bottom.
rep,us ptriot tactical $35000000 company based out of texas.
rep,they sell military apparel to citizens.
prospect,your screen is not it's not showing anymore.
rep,oh okay so this is the parts warehouse so the moment i start typing bissel all the parts for bissel are left huh all the models for bissel are right and these are some of the top searches for bissel us patriot tacticle for them brand is very important because they sell apparel now the moment i start typing in ni start showing you another most popular brand nike on top and starts guiding me right. i said it's important to guide the customer so this is how you can start guiding the customer yeah you're guiding them to a popular brand you're guiding them to some of the popular categories depending on what there is they start typing you also open up some of the other brands and some of their other popular categories for the customers to look at some of the popular products and some top queries starting with ni. not just that see over say over a period of time if black shoes the fourth product became more popular people were clicking more on this or buying this more often this would come on position one and the others would come below.
rep,express went live recently they wanted something like this.
rep,the moment i start typing in jeans you see jeans and then lot of different categories for jeans for women men in loose blue crob and the moment i start placing my cursor on these the images start changing. and then lastly i know this is not from a vertical at all but but wanted to show you the breadth of customization of the solution.
rep,big basket calm second largest grocery etailor in apac.
rep,never in newsview couple of corner go for the two hundred million dollar funding and and they had a typical challenge right so if you and i look back at our groceries and will notice we end up buying similar products right the same 10 15 products every time we do grocery is the same milk bread egg they had similar kind of visitors on their on their side buying 15 20 products and it used to take 60 to 80 clicks for them to even buy 15 to 20 products on the side for them to search go to pdp page add to cart and then checkout. so instead what we for them the moment i start typing in chicken starts showing me all the options for chicken all the products for chicken the ability to increase quantity and add to cart right here from chicken sorry from the the autosuggest box. not just that opens up some of the commonly system chicken and then halal cut chicken is  some of the other ch ic matching of the chicken categories here some of the categories within chicken and we took it to the next level by adding personalization to it meaning if you were buying chicken without skin more often you see chicken without skin on top but if i was buying say masala chicken more often then i would start seeing masala chicken on top any question in it.
rep,okay so this is so the the business piece right the auto suggest piece i would say now let me show you the technology so before the the founders started unbxd right they spent quite some time good one year and doing research on two things one they crawled through our say i would say web crawled the lot of large e-commerce catalog was available to see how these catalogs were structured today two they did a lot of research in terms of how people are searching online be it on google search or we be it on amazon or any other e-commerce site how do people usually search and we classified the search queries into 12 different types right. so say exact query then i know the exact model number exact part number of the search of the product that i am looking for feature search will be say red dress where red is the feature of the product dress. themattic search could be a party dress where party again is the theme for the product dress linguistic short cut i'm looking for a 55 inch tv and instead of inch i go and put double quotes that becomes a linguistic shortcut query or say natural language query gifts for kids no product specified there but the system needs to be able to understand the intent of the customer and we built a relevancy engine that was able to handle all these 12 different types of queries for any e-commerce site. on top of this what we did was we built an error tolerance system okay so this is a multi-word spell check single word spell check so here not only we automatically correct 85 to 90% of your search queries but we also immediately start showing results not waiting for the customer to click onto something. the other 10 15 percent of the queries that we are not able to solve are actually the ones which are so butchered that it's really difficult for an automated system but you can understand it from from an algorithm strength perspective you have built the system that is able to auto correct us misspelled query of up to six words with two alphabets misspelled in each word.
rep,then in stemming say dress dresses any singular plural words are stemmed words in your case i chose sweatshirts right so sweat shirts with space or without space or say game gaming center central laptop laptops. the intent of the customer doesn't change right what they mean doesn't change so we built a system that was able to automatically understand these stemmed words i start showing the results accordingly giving giving you basically the freedom to create you know any or say not to create any libraries at the back end most of the other systems that you will see out there expect you to create huge libraries for the singular plural words or the stem words on the synonymous words. but with us there is a universal corpus that we maintain so you don't have to worry about that. but on top of it we do give you the ability to create synonyms for here industry jargons for your site jurgens to give you an example one of your one of our customer who sells to the weightlifting gear in the weightlifting world the shoes are called lifters now there is no way we will would know that the shoes are called lifters for the weightlifting world and it doesn't make sense for us to add that into our universal corpus because lifters might mean totally different thing in a different industry altogether hence we give you the ability to create synonyms from our back-end which could be unidirectional bidirectional or replacement synonyms. automated redirect whenever you have something in your category or the category page and then the customer comes and searches for it the right place to take them is to that particular category page right. so so the most obvious queries are automatically redirected to the category pages in this case the sneakers even the singular sneakers is redirected to the category page.
rep,but say if you want to redirect something else like sandals to sneakers that is something that you can do from our back end any question.
prospect,what is our you know show me what the back end looks like.
rep,i'll show you that after after a few slides and i'll take you to the back end.
rep,yeah head query search so say sometimes we don't have the clear intent from the customer on this example you notice mobile right here yet not clear if the customer is looking for mobile mobile head phone cases covers headsets we give we have actually the technology to find the right categories and start showing them in the order of importance of popularity. so we started showing mobile headphones cases covers but we also start showing products for the most obvious of the most popular category which is mobile here. so we have automated already started showing mobile phones now over a period of time if people were clicking on say mobile cases more often than mobile headphones then mobile cases will come on position two and mobile headphones would go and position three . position three . this is something we built as a demo for outnet now outnet sells a lot of designer apparel alexander wang is one of the designer.
rep,this is something we built as a demo for outnet now outnet sells a lot of designer apparel alexander wang is one of the designer.
rep,if i was to search for alexander wang who makes a lot of different products like tods shoulder bags shoes dresses you see all of these products neatly bucketed into each category giving you the ability to browse through these products on a single page horizontally or vertically. dynamic filters big differentiator we bring to the table i notice that you do not have filters today on the site on the current site now these are dynamic in nature in two ways. one so say for a category shoes as a category you you would want to set up a very specific filters which are relevant to shoes category say size and call height width casual shoe type now if the customer comments comes onto your site and searches for shoes and no matter how the search for shoes beat men's casual shoe shoes formal shoes sometimes they might not even use the word shoes and they might come and search for say men's adidas or men's nike as far as 75% or more products are from a particular category that being shoes here the shoes filters would automatically kick in. right so you don't have to go and set filters for search queries that's one way now the second level of the dynamicity of of these filters is over a period of time said people were clicking on width as a filter more often on the price as a filter more ofter than the size or the ankle height width would show up on top of the page right in the order of of what filters the customer sees and the most popular filter will be on top and then in order of popularity they will have the different filters.
prospect,i guess so yeah i mean this is definitely a functionality that we want yeah just thinking about like this is the kind of stuff that so this shows up in the search results but what if i want these filters let's say like if somebody clicks on you know those pins like the officer pins or it says club secretary but they in rather than searching for the secretary pin they click on you know in the header they click on pins and then officer pins and they only want to see secretary pins do you guys do the dynamic filters if they're on category pages or is only for search results.
rep,so the this is something the filters we can handle for category pages as well.
rep,that is yes.
prospect,does it matter what shopify anymore does it mean to be a custom do you know what.
rep,uh usually not usually not but i can again check on that and get back to you or we can discuss our during uh maybe a tech call i could have my technical team to answer that but usually not. because the way we meant is that as i showed in the beginning that it's it's it really does not depend on your platform how we are going to render is these functionalities have have no link with the platform the only advantage of you being on shopify is that with shopify we have a plugin so all the information with regards to the product catalog feed we start pulling out directly from shopify you don't have to send your product catalog feeds field sep basically you don't have to send us separately to us right whatever you are updating on shopify is automatically updated to unbxd. but apart from that be it on any any platform all of these functionalities. variances you have variances say if you have different images for these variants products these could be variances of color variances of size or any other vince's. we have the technology to find the right variant image and start showing it say in this example red dress all of these dresses are available in the red but primarily the site is showing us the blue and the black back of the images of these dresses putting the onus on the customer to click on the red swatch and then look at the red dress image right giving giving the customer the first feel that these your dresses might not be available in red .
rep,so as far as the red dress images index in the product catalog feed the we can pick up the variant image and we can start showing that for for search queries.
rep,okay we take you to the with our colour synonym corpus so say if i go on to a site and look for a crimson dress now if the site has a crimson in dress we first start showing that if they do not have the crimson dress we understand crimson is from the red color family red garnet ruby rose are them much more closer colors to crimson so we immediately pick up some of the other red color products and start showing the red color products and not the blue black or the browns.
rep,zero result page you are always going to have your result page and the reason being you might not be carrying a product you might not be carrying a brand or say your the search queries so butcher that it's really difficult for the automated system to understand the intent of the customer in that case we believe the onus is on us to start guiding the customer and we do this this in two ways this is highly personalized and in real time for each individual user looks at the other zero result page right these are not static pages we do this by putting in two different widgets one is the recently viewed widget products that that particular customer had been looking at on your website this gives them the opportunity to go back in there product discovery journey and then based on their affinity towards a brand was the color towards the category price point we start recommending some of the products that then that particular customer might be more likely to buy on the site and then put another widget here that says recommendations. similar products that could be hundred reasons why i like this shoes again could be their designer the tries point um the color the style customer can come and click on see similar products that opens up a small modal window with other products for the customer to look at they like it they click on and they don't they close the modal window and go back onto the search results page. same thing on mobile.
rep,yeah the site has is mobile. and assuming that's responsive.
prospect,yep yeah.
rep,okay awesome so all of these functionalities would work on responsive site say mobile alternatives of customer like this these sunglasses and they can click on more like this it'll open up again a small model windoe on the mobile phone giving them the opportunity to quickly evaluate some similar products 3 for similar products if they like it they can click on those products they're doing the closer model window and go back on to their search way. mobile autosuggest scope suggestions and recent searches highly personalized for each individual user on site . category refinement shows men women for them to basically refine into categories look at limited set of products and relevant products on a smaller mobile screen. and then the filters are so multi select filters some of the enterprises have not been able to build this for mobile we give you this out of the box the ability to select multiple filters to again limit the number of results of the products that one would want to look at on the smaller mobile screen.
rep,so so far what i've shown you is three out of the five things one was a business piece the auto suggests these filters on both mobile and desktop now i want to show you two more things one is our back-end dashboard and two is the reporting and this is primarily for search my screams here so i can show you our live demo of this back-end so do you see the dashboard. ok so this is the dashboard that is built for this particular demo site.
rep,once we have done the implementation you will have a login for this dashboard you can manage multiple sites multiple domains could be alive all testing sites or even multiple domains right here from a single login you will have all the details like number of products feed size and other details available here. these are your product catalog fields basically and then we make them searchable on non not searchable we to need up. but you we'll have complete visibility into that here this is where you can create filters these are global filters or facets say you want price i'm here and you can select the price and create facet and i mean we'll be good to go then synonyms again to reiterate you don't create synonyms for misspelled words are synonymous words this is only for industrial jargons say lifters bidirectional. question for the facets near back to that.
prospect,so those are only those are only global facets then right.
rep,yeah. pardon me.
prospect,their global facets so what so if we had let's say like the officer pins going with that example and we want you to be able to filter by position well that's the only category that has position as a you know a facet whereas like curriculum books we want people to be able to filter by age is that something that would be done in unbxd or is that something we have to do separate.
rep,all these things will be automatically done right for a particular category if there are only five fields which will be done by at our end but even at you are doesn't say if you were to do it let me just quickly show you so say for men as a category right you can come here you can come here and click on merchandise you can add any banners for this particular category page and say facets right so for men as a category here are some of the brand filter on the second position i want the color filter on the third position and you're good right. so now however someone searches as far as 75% of more products are shown men as a category these filters would automatically kick in and and these would kick in in this particular order.
prospect,gotcha go i think so.
rep,that helps.
prospect,yes so can you show me like for the category like slippers  actually fragrances probably let's so get fragrances what our fragrances facets.
rep,yeah this is me what we have is a is a dump off data this is a very basic dump of later but yeah so what happens is during the implementation we set particular set of filters right for each category but this is where you can also come and modify change these filters so you.
prospect,would need to like about for example if i wanted fragrance you know if i wanted a facet that was flower it smells like you know like the flower scent and you add like rose or tulip or orchid or whatever flower you would create that facet in the global facet area and then it would show up here and you would just hide all the other ones and then keep that fragrance on okay.
prospect,and then i need to make sure that one was that the fragrance was hidden.
prospect,on other categories.
rep,no so the other categories would typically not pick it up right so what happens is when when we go to the other categories right in the catalog the field type right they might right price is something common which will always remain same and say brand is something common or the longest in your go color or say shoe size right or ankle height or ankle height is something which is very specific to shoes so now for shoes or it will automatically show up but when it when when we go to shorts category it will not show because for shorts category the ankle height field itself is not relevant it's not right there correct on the on your product catelogue feed and hence it will not come in as a filter.
prospect,and then so my next question this is unrelated but i mean really the whole conversation is if we have and this kind of ties into the timeline then we use you guys and we also hire a agency to design category pages and stuff how does that relate to the work you guys do i mean would you guys end up coming in and undoing some of the work they do or how does that typically work timeline wise.
rep,typically not right we do not touch our ui or ux except a few of the things like auto suggest or placing those recommendation widgets where you want to put some of these things that's it right apart from that we don't touch your ui we only render results we show the relevant products keeping the ui same whatever ui you have so typically not but what what we can do is who this is this is a much more broader question if this is something that you want to immediately do what we can do is we can do a three-way called we knew your agency and my team my tech team to understand the scope of work in terms of what each of them is doing and time it accordingly. because in some cases we have seen that if parallely done implementation with redesigning of the sites in some cases we have not right and that's a call i leave with the tech team to take to make sure that that the complete implementation goes smoothly and does not create any conflicts right . and at the same time at times it helps to do both together so that you are not doing and undoing stuff you might have ended up paying your agency for doing something that we could have probably handled at our end.
prospect,yeah and that's what i'm that's what i'm curious about like if we just because if we just tell the agency look we wanted to do a design yeah we just want them to do the design and the development of the front-end look and feel and then we leave some of the ux search stuff to you guys let's say pays us money well the design stuff and it you know we have some budget for you you guys but i was running on something you guys with five months $500 a month switch maybe has changed or maybe i just don't have a the numbers also so we'll have to figure out how to revert numbers to you money to you guys that we're gonna use both you know so but the site search and product recommendations.
rep,not so charlie what what i would recommend is to do a three-way call and to understand the scope of much more detailed and then that we can put the timelines in terms of when we can start the project and then how you can work with the agency was the and with unbxd and what each of the teams can probably deliver.
prospect,okay all right well aren't we so infer fix that have decided upon an agency but when we do that we will.
rep,yeah sounds good so i know we are running out of time but let me quickly show you some of the merchandising fee features for search so say for search if you want to set any global rules to give you an example to not show out of inventory products are always promote home brand always promote the high margin products you can set those global rules here and let me show you how you can set rules in <> right by giving any taking an example of a particular query. so say dressed as a search query and it'll become merchandise and this is the demo site so here if i click on say i if i search for dress you'll see the first two blue dresses and the striped dress and the brown color dress right. you'll see the replica of his site on our merchandising dashboard same products same images in the same order as your site now this is the 90% experience that we deliver these are all relevant dresses with the right logic in terms of the popularity conversion rates right all of those consider and we start promoting the right kind of products. but then your merchants might have some insights about the business that we might not have and they might want to come in overwrite some of these rules. and this is where they can that the 10% of the additional control is something that we could give the customer to come and change things through the merchandising dashboard and then start experimenting a few things start promoting a few things and run this business as their own not leave everything on unbxd.
rep,so to give an example why this is important say now someone wants to come and filter they can come and filter using any of the attribute of your brand of your catalog field or they want to run promotions sorting boosting slotting and let me show you say boost and let's boost a particular brand contains eliza. so you see now all the aligned products are on top these are still dresses but all eliza dresses are on top even within eliza dress maybe this dress is going out of season and you want to get rid of the inventory and all you want to show it on top you can drag and drop and pin product . my internet is actually a little slow here you might see a delay. okay just drag and drop and then pin product okay now this was a particular product that was pinned now what if i want to pin based on a product catalog attribute level and and we call it a slotting so. for example in position 5 & 6 i want a particular brand let me say now the 5th and the 6th products are the ralph lauren dresses even if this dress goes out of inventory this will be replaced by the next best ralph lauren dress. all of these changes on the site in real time.
rep,yeah well as dresses we pin the other two ralph lauren dresses right and then you can also add banners you can insert an image url landing page url or an html for these particular search query results page. now let me quickly show you one more thing which is the landing page the clearance today site doesn't show anything under clearance so i come back they are running a clearance for this month this year this quarter um clearance merchandise obviously doesn't show anything because the site doesn't have anything convert to landing page click ok. now you'll have your complete catalog to curate for this particular landing page so say brand contains eliza. now you can start sorry now you can start using the same rules you can start pinning products you can start slotting products add the the banners to this particular landing page and now if i go back onto the website look for clearance you'll get those same products as we looked at on the merchandising dashboard in the same order now you can take this particular url and start using it for any of your marketing campaigns seo campaigns email marketing campaigns google ad campaigns to promote this particular landing page. so that's the merchandising piece i already show you the category page now let me quickly show you the reporting.
rep,so in reporting we provide three levels of reporting one is the high level executive reporting in terms of top search queries top products added to cart top zero result queries top click products gives you a very high level understanding sorry in terms of what are your top searches what are your non performing searches what our top performing products non-performing products and what is your traffic or from search versus browse then the next level is a query level in-depth reporting for each each and every query on your site. and this is not your top 50 queries top 250 queries out of 500 queries right this is dependent on time you can look at last one one data three months data six months data one year data and then start evaluating what are your top queries are what in general every query is performing like so say for dresses what our hits conversion ctr orders if i click on both this is trend line in terms of conversion how the sales have been for dresses over a period of time and what are the products which are associated with this particular query and what is that each and individual products performance. on the flip side product level reporting if you have merchants category category managers looking at a particular set of products they can come here and see each and individual product performance so say this particular product what are the views what are the add to cart. they click on product again we will get a trend line in terms of performance and sales and some of the queries that this particular product is associated with . so that's the reporting piece any questions.
prospect,nope no questions .
rep,that was this search similarly what we have is also recommendations so for recommendation what we do is show some of the slides here just a moment when i open you slides yep. recommendation solution is primarily built on a very high level four things right popularity wisdom of cloud content based and personalization. so popularity popularity of that particular product on your site what is the basically the trend in terms of the add to cars or their buying behavior of people on the site are even at times just a click home how often a particular product wisdom of the crowd right formation of user you they can do more process people coming from chicago people of younger age versus older right how these different group of people are today looking at these products. and then on the content once meaning similarity in terms of content right if i'm looking for a full sleeve shirt the other product that you might want to recommend is a full sleeve shirt right another short sleeve shirt personalization for that particular  user we gather a lot of analytics in terms of what they are looking on the site their affinities towards particular brand towards particular category price point. based on these four parameters basically we start recommending products not just that we also differentiate between you user versus a repeat user for new users what is important is say location now to give you an example if i was to come in look for jackets on a site if someone is coming from chicago and looking for jackets you might want to show them thicker warmmer jackets but someone coming from la area you might want to show them lighter jacket so.
rep,that's the geo location-based in terms of new user . festivity if there is a particular trend so say in in chicago there is some festival happening right now and red is in an over last two days we've been seen a lot of products are looking at people coming from chicago were actually looking at red color jackets. so we start showing them the red color jackets because of that kind of trend or festivity and then their current actions what are their current actions are they looking at a $50 jacket or a $500 jacket based on that we start again recommending them products accordingly that's for new user. for a repeat customer obviously all of these would apply but also at the same time what will also apply is their past behavior on the site what are their affinity is towards product price brand style what they've been buying what they've been looking on your site if you would have an implicit customer profile for each of your visitor and we'd save this for forever right as far as they're coming from the same machine we would have the information in terms of what they did on your site during the last session. and based on that we start recommending the products any questions.
prospect,no no i think it
prospect,looks good i think i mean what's the is this also going to the setup like is this setup $3000 for site search and and or recommendations .
rep,includes both .
prospect,so it would be so it'd be 3000 for setup plust two thousand for the first so in the first month we really paying five thousand.
rep,so you paid three thousand we go into implementation for four weeks right after four weeks we will take the site live that is when you start paying two thousand.
prospect,gotchaa okay so it's three thousand for the first month essentially then and then two thousand thereafter.
prospect,okay and then the the upsell this shows up in the kind of all over so it's what they see when they gets the website as well as the product pages and search too.
rep,absolutely . yes yes so this is the logic technology but what is the application of these right so basically.
prospect,<> i want to see what it looks like.
rep,absolutely i'll show you some examples right so we have 10 different widgets say recently viewed viewed also we bought also bought brand top sellers within a brand page category top seller within a  in a category page right here is an example say real-time personalization . someone comes on here are your site for the first time you start showing them some of the products handpick just for you based on where they are coming from what is the festivity what is a trend there this is another way of putting recommending products on the homepage this site is actually on shopify economy i think it's called economy delivers they are into restaurant supply and they are on shopify so here you notice popular items these are the products which are popular on the site you can define the period where you want to keep popularity for last one week one one day one month last three months popular items based on your business right so those are the finer things which can be tuned you will have access just like search dashboard you will have access to browse recommendation dashboard wherein you can also make some of these changes. alternative products right someone looking at this particular bracelet now we have a we know what color they are looking at for brand they are looking at what is the price point well they're looking right so we start recommending some of the products around those also with regards to say price $65 now you might want to start showing them products which are in the ten twenty percent deviation range which are 10% or 20% lesser or higher and not show them products which are like five dollars versus or something which is say $200 . right because this is what the price affinity so you can go and define those those minor things show up sell products of plus or minus of 10 percent or plus or minus of 15 percent in terms of what we show. so sixty five dollars you'll see 75 dollars right or say eighty five dollars now someone clicks on eighty five dollars now we know that they are looking at a little higher price point we can from them products in that particular price ring also we would still be looking at <> price but also the styling the color the brand and some of the other catalog parameters which are important for your business and start recommending products based on them.
rep,so say we would have noticed five out of ten people buying humidifiers are also also mine cart widgets so he immediately starts showing cart widgets five out of ten people who buy nail color are also buying lip colors so we immediately start showing lip color to kind of cross sell someone who's buying a nail color. similar products within the cart someone's not checked out they're still in the cart not sure if they want to to check out you can put a widget and start showing some of the similar products for them to be sure and to evaluate and complete the purchase if something i showed you as part of our search presentation these are two recommendation widgets actually recently viewed and and recommendations which we put as part of our search solutions as  well. same thing for similar products this is again a part of search solution as well as a recommendation solution because start showing some of the similar products to the customers same thing on mobile this is the pdp page recommendations someone on a mobile product page you can start showing them. some of the alternative products on a smaller mobile screen as well. and then finally the by the look so say merchants can come and define that in that that shorts right if someone is looking for short start recommending them t-shirts jackets shoes and then we can provider by the look button so the customer has the ability to click on buy the look but and merchants define what kind of products to be shown here and this way the customer now can complete the look now knows that with this shorts this jacket this shoes or this t-shirt might go well and they can select what to buy and complete the look. so that's the very high level of produc tommendation solution any questions.
rep,and similarly we will also have the dashboard for the product recommendation solution also to make some of these final minor changes.
rep,great so that's the solution from an implementation time and perspective we have four weeks let me just make sure i covered everything you get 24-hour seven support which would be an e-mail phone or on chat you'll have a dedicated account manager to talk to starting from implementation to post implementation one point of contact for any questions that need to be answered five nine of times with you know wherein we are ready to even penalize ourselves for any downtime on the site upto 15% 15 minute of downtime we are ready to penalize ourselves 15% of the monthly fee .
prospect,okay. when you when you do that does the money then go where does that go to that come to us .
rep,so far so so far we have not been a suitation to pay our customers back.
rep,complete infrastructure on amazon is on aws we also use the amazon cloudfront as our  cdn insuring also we have our disaster recovery we have as our systems as well so we have a concrete disaster recovery solution what's the worst case now time i think couple of years ago during the holiday season in december of we were new and there was a very high cliff we saw a downtime up to three minutes we have very high checkpoints the moment something goes down everyone's gets an alert on the system and so 2 to 3 minutes downtime is what we saw during the thanksgiving period that was around i would say two and half three years i think three years from now this is yeah not the last one but the one before that but after that we haven't seen any any major downtime.
rep,so yeah that's the solution yes any questions.
prospect,no sorry what.
rep,like it not like it .
prospect,yeah i think it's great i think that well we run into a snag but we're gonna have to do is because it's gonna cost ya you know if we start off with even just the site search that's a thousand dollars a month and because we're spending more than ten thousand dollars over the course of a year we would have to put this out to bid which is just not fun at all so we need to find three other you know two other people i think you look at home next topia and one other one here's we have to do it it's just part of our processes so the sooner we start that the better because that can take a long time as i have recently found out. so we'll do that i think that will probably if we were to do one or the other i think we'd probably do the site search
prospect,to start off and then product recommendations later but is is the the set up fee is it three thousand if we do site search or.
rep,it wouldn't really do both or what. it would be like if if you do this besides such it would still be around two thousand dollars in non we have the set a fee because what happens is our analytics piece and some of the some of the things remain right so that's why we recommend customers to implement both together separately it might cost much higher than what i've given you now the other thing if you have if you want to evaluate both together what i can also do is for the first 60 days i can give you site search so we can what we do is typically we give a 50% poc engagement model meaning during the first 60 days you pay us 50 percent right which is thousand dollars thousand dollars for the first first two months now post the two months from at the on the 61st today of going live you will have you can make a decision whether you want to continue with unbxd or not if you plan to continue with unbxd that's the point where you pay the remaining 50% for the last two months am i am i clear .
prospect,yeah its clear help us so so so.
rep,if in case that help and also include or 50% poc model for you this will give you time to kind of test us test our service be sure and then then take it from there.
prospect,okay yeah it's not even that it's i mean it said i want to use this you know it's um it's more the fact that we have to do this rfp thing so i have to talk to i have to talk to some folks because this number originally i don't know where we got the $500 a month from you guys but we thought it was going to be $500 a month for the site search not all thousand and so it effectively takes us from 6000 to 12000 and you know and we i need to figure out where we're going to find that extra $6000 so .
rep,okay so do let me know know how you want to proceed from here and then do let me know the next steps i'd be more than happy to connect
rep,okay great thanks a lot.
prospect,thank you have a good day.
rep,thank you too bye,
